In today''s day and age to have a garden, that too inside the Rashtrapati Bhawan, named after Mughals is unacceptable. That''s why I have proposed to name it after the first President Dr Rajendra Prasad.\"",

A key feature of the adaptive immune system is memory. Repeat infections by the same virus are met immediately with a strong and specific response that usually effectively stops the infection with less reliance on the innate system. When we say we are immune to infection with a virus, we are talking about immune memory. Vaccines protect us against infection because of immune memory. The first adaptive response against a virus \u2013 called the primary response \u2013 often takes days to mature. In contrast, a memory response develops within hours of infection. Memory is maintained by a subset of B and T lymphocytes called memory cells which survive for years in the body. Memory cells remain ready to respond rapidly and efficiently to a subsequent encounter with a pathogen. This so-called secondary response is often stronger than the primary response to infection. Consequently, childhood infections protect adults, and immunity conferred by vaccination can last for years.",

Aleman says, one thing is becoming clear: antibodies might not be telling the whole story when it comes to COVID-19 immunity. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t just look blindly at antibody tests.\" The article also states, Aleman and other virologists and immunologists when turning their attention to COVID-19, they began to study how immunity developed in people who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, as well as their close contacts, some of whom were presumably exposed to the virus, even if they didn\u2019t get sick. As expected, hospitalized individuals developed strong antibody and T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2. But two-thirds of the close contacts who were asymptomatic showed a subsequent T cell response, even though tests didn\u2019t detect any antibodies - Study results, released June 29 without peer review via the medical pre-print service medRxiv, didn\u2019t reveal whether these individuals never developed antibodies or whether they rapidly declined to undetectable levels. Regardless, the report immediately raised concerns about a vaccine, since stimulating antibody production is a key strategy by which immunizations protect against disease.\n\nThe article also cites recently reported work by immunologist Antonio Bertoletti from Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore - Patients infected with the original SARS virus still possessed memory T cells that responded to the virus\u2019 proteins 17 years later. These same memory T cells also reacted to SARS-CoV-2. It\u2019s something Bertoletti says bodes well for COVID-19.",

It\u2019s hard to argue that extremely sick people, let alone dead people, had been obscured by low levels of testing but suddenly revealed by higher levels.\n\nWithout a doubt, many cases of Covid-19 in March, April, and May weren\u2019t picked up. In late June, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield told reporters that as many as 90% of cases had been missed; that is, although there were 2.3 million confirmed cases in the U.S. then, some 20 million people had probably been infected. But that reasoning applies today, too: Despite months of government claims to the contrary, not everyone who wants, or should have, a test is getting one. Using data from Covid Tracking, STAT looked at the number of people tested and the number who tested positive for the disease (cases) in every state and Washington, D.C. We did that for three dates: in mid-May, mid-June, and mid-July. (Due to reporting anomalies, the dates selected sometimes differed by a day or two between states.)\n\nFor each date, we calculated the number of cases found per 1,000 tests \u2014 a measure of the disease\u2019s prevalence. For example, in Florida on May 13, that rate was 32. On June 13 it was 75. On July 13 it was 193. On May 13, Florida tested 15,159 people; on July 13, it tested 65,567.

The CARES Act implemented a fixed supplement to all workers in part because it\nwas viewed as infeasible to implement policies which depended on individual earnings. Since the $600 UI\nsupplement was targeted to generate 100% earnings replacement based on mean earnings, this $600 sup-\nplement tends to imply greater than 100% earnings replacement for those with less than mean earnings.\nFurthermore, these high replacement rates for below-mean workers are amplified by the fact that the dis-\ntribution of earnings is skewed: median earnings are less than mean earnings. This means that the typical\nunemployed worker has below-mean prior earnings and thus above-mean replacement rates. This implies\nthat most workers have replacement rates above 100%.",

Minks can act as a reservoir of SARS-CoV-2, passing the virus between them, and pose a risk for virus spill-over from mink to humans. People can then transmit this virus within the human population. Additionally, spill-back (human to mink transmission) can occur. It remains a concern when any animal virus spills in to the human population, or when an animal population could contribute to amplifying and spreading a virus affecting humans. As viruses move between human and animal populations, genetic modifications in the virus can occur. These changes can be identified through whole genome sequencing, and when found, experiments can study the possible implications of these changes on the disease in humans.",

Treatment is time-consuming and expensive as it involves undergoing long-term therapy with chelating agents, which remove heavy metals from the body.\n\nTreatment also involves persuading people to adopt new practices and behaviours, something which requires an ongoing effort from authorities to continuously raise awareness and make sure the population follows preventive measures.\n\nAccording to WHO, children in seven villages in Zamfara state require chelation therapy. This is in addition to the residents of seven other villages who have already received treatment. In these villages the combined effects of removing children from lead exposure and providing chelation therapy caused the child mortality rate to drop from 43 per cent to 1 per cent in one year.\n\nSince the problem was discovered last year, $1.9 million has been provided by the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to WHO and the UN Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), which have been used to provide treatment, train doctors, provide quick diagnoses, and raise awareness about the hazards of lead.",

Cell phones generate radio-frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF), resulting in local exposure of the human body to RF-EMF. Concerns have been raised regarding the potential effects of RF-EMF exposure on human health. Short-term exposure in adults is regarded as safe; however, potential health effects of long-term exposure and exposure of fetuses and children are not well studied (2, 3).\n\nThe interpretation of results from epidemiologic studies evaluating health effects of RF-EMF exposure from cell-phone use is challenging. Because of the technical evolution of mobile communication systems, similar levels of cell-phone use do not necessarily induce similar levels of RF-EMF exposure. Users\u2019 exposure to RF-EMF from third-generation (3G) devices is much lower than that from second-generation (2G) devices (4). More recent technologies (4G/5G) also differ from 3G devices, though less, in terms of users\u2019 exposure.",

In a 2016 interview, he expressed displeasure with Trump and Hillary Clinton, saying there\u2019s \u201cmuch funny business on both sides of the aisle.\u201d\n\nHe praised Trump at the time because he was \u201conto something\u201d and \u201csecretly everybody\u2019s getting tired of political correctness, kissing up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really in a p\u2014y generation. Everybody\u2019s walking on eggshells. We see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff. When I grew up, those things weren\u2019t called racist,\u201d he said.\n\nNow, he\u2019s changed his tune a bit on Trump.\n\nWhile he approves of \u201ccertain things\u201d the president has done, he wishes that he would act \u201cin a more genteel way, without tweeting and calling people names. I would personally like for him to not bring himself to that level,\u201d he said.\n\nEastwood also touched on the controversy surrounding Olivia Wilde\u2019s character, Kathy Scruggs, in his 2019 film \u201cRichard Jewell.\u201d He showed Scruggs, the real-life reporter who alleged Jewell planted a bomb at the 1996 Olympics, sleeping with an FBI source to get information. Lawyers for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the newspaper at which Scruggs worked, called the portrayal \u201centirely false and malicious, and\u2026extremely defamatory and damaging.\u201d The film was Clintwood\u2019s worst opening in 40 years.\n\nThe director defended his right to cinematic freedom and said the newspaper was trying to shroud its \u201cguilt\u201d over a \u201creckless story.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, she hung out at a little bar in town, where mostly police officers went,\u201d he said",

In return this has enhanced animal productivity and value\naddition on raw products.\n County Governments have allocated on average 6.7 % of their total budgets to the\nAgriculture sector. This is just 3% less of the 10% recommended allocation as per\nthe Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) Malabo\ndeclaration. The achievement of the 10% required or more would be realized if the\ndevolved monies held at the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation, are\nreleased to Counties. The Council will continue to pursue reforms in this sector to\nensure the best interest of the farmers in the Counties is achieved.\n\uf0b7 On the overall, the performance of the agriculture sector in the year 2018/2019\nsignificantly improved as per the Economic Survey report 2019.

It also absorbs infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface, effectively trapping heat in the troposphere. Therefore, the climate impact of changes in ozone concentrations varies with the altitude at which these ozone changes occur. The major ozone losses that have been observed in the lower stratosphere due to the human-produced chlorine- and bromine-containing gases have a cooling effect on the Earth's surface. On the other hand, the ozone increases that are estimated to have occurred in the troposphere because of surface-pollution gases have a warming effect on the Earth's surface, thereby contributing to the \"greenhouse\" effect.",

This new disease, officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO), is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses.  Some cause illness in people, and others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19.  Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated in animals and then spread to people.",

In addition, the extensive spread of 2009 H1N1 flu within the United States made it extremely resource-intensive for states to count individual cases.

Therefore, the data shown on this page may be incomplete, and will likely not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period, especially for the more recent time periods. Death counts for earlier weeks are continually revised and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received from the states by NCHS.

The use of the Portuguese phrase \u201cAtualizado ha 1 hora\u201d in the screen grab, while the rest appears in English, indicates it is likely photoshopped.\n\nWhile there is no record of Swift calling for the Statue of Liberty\u2019s removal, she did ask the state of Tennessee to remove the statues of \u201cracist historical figures\u201d in a June 12 tweet.",

                        "answer": "Current and former election officials in vote-by-mail states said their systems are designed specifically to mitigate these risks, starting with a regular stream of mail contact with voters to establish that the address listed for them on the rolls is accurate. The ERIC system, as well as regular checks against DMV, death and other records, flag voter registration entries that may need updating. Federal law also requires states to conduct basic list maintenance.\n\nOnce voting begins, the linchpin of the process is a ballot return envelope, which typically requires the voter\u2019s signature and includes a unique bar code linked to that voter\u2019s record. When the ballot is returned and the bar code is scanned, no other ballot can be cast by that voter for that election.\n\nElection officials and security experts said certain measures are important for preventing fraud in mail voting, such as accurate voter rolls and a method of authenticating ballots such as signature matching. Such safeguards have been put in place over time in the five states that currently run universal mail elections: Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington.\n\nThe other mainstay of election security in vote-by-mail states is the signature verification process. Election workers are trained by law enforcement agencies to detect when a signature on the ballot envelope does not match signatures in a voter\u2019s file. Discrepancies trigger a review that could end with a voter proving his or her identity \u2014 or being reported to law enforcement for possible ballot tampering.\n\nAll-mail states have implemented a range of other safeguards to ensure ballots are secure at all times, including dropboxes under 24-hour surveillance cameras, rules that two people be present with any ballot from the moment of receipt or collection, and detailed logs and reconciliation rules that require votes to be accounted for, down to the ballot.",

It is likely to have its ancestral origins in a bat species (1,2) but it probably reached humans through an intermediary species (pangolins have been suggested) (3,4), or mutated within humans to be able to be transmitted between people and cause disease (3). This is a priority area for research but it is important to note that subsequent transmission of COVID-19 is from person to person. It is transmission between people that has spread the disease globally.",

In 2009 the CPS reviewed four sexual assault claims against Savile and felt there was insufficient evidence with which to proceed - again, because none of Savile's accusers were prepared to support police action. Frankly, the CPS makes a lot of decisions like this and it would be strange for the director himself to make the decision personally - that's the responsibility of the reviewing lawyer. We may well question that decision, but asking whether there was in fact sufficient evidence is one thing; to assume that such evidence would have resulted in a conviction is quite another. Have any of us seen the evidence the CPS was presented with?  Have those spinning these accusations - or spreading them - actually spoken with any of those who brought the initial complaints against Savile? Starmer took over a CPS under fire on various fronts and, after 2011, especially on the Savile issue. While he had no personal involvement in the decision not to proceed, Starmer did commission a review, headed by Alison Levitt QC, in which he revealed failures at the heart of the CPS and in 2013 issued an apology. He acknowledged those failures, pledging to change the culture of the CPS and its internal mechanisms. A \"fundamental shift\" was required, he argued, as \"we cannot afford another Savile moment in five or ten years. While \"no improper motives\" were found, the Evening Standard reported that one of the review's major criticisms was that \"the CPS lawyer (my italics) should have challenged the police conclusions and sought to build a prosecution against Savile\". It also suggested the complainants should have been informed that there had been other complaints about Savile, as this would potentially have encouraged them to give evidence. This",

Absentee Ballot Request Form before the deadline. The request must be signed and include identifying information about the voter, including date of birth and driver\u2019s license number or last four digits of the voter\u2019s Social Security number. Voters must vote their ballot in the presence of two witnesses or a notary, and those witnesses must sign the absentee return envelope certifying that the voter marked their ballot and is the registered voter submitting the marked ballot.\n\nOnly the voter or their near relative or legal guardian may return the ballot. Upon return, the county board of elections reviews the absentee envelope to ensure compliance with the legal requirements. Once the ballot is accepted, that voter is marked in the system as having voted in that election.\n\nData on who has requested absentee ballots is now confidential until Election Day. Criminal penalties have been increased for absentee voting fraud-related offenses. Many people are watching our absentee voting process, including candidates, political parties, county boards of elections, and political and data scientists. If there are anomalies or questionable activities, they will be identified by or reported to election officials.\n\nFinally, the State Board of Elections has an Investigations Division that investigates credible allegations of elections fraud and refers cases to prosecutors when warranted by the evidence. The State Board also conducts several post-election audits which will catch inconsistencies that can then be investigated by the board or the Investigations Division.",

Throughout the ancient world, anyone who functioned as a servant was usually a slave.\n\nIn the kind of servitude called slavery, the laborer is considered property. He or she can be bought and sold like any other commodity. The origins of slavery are unknown, but it probably emerged as an economic necessity or convenience when people began to establish permanent communities based on agriculture.",

Indentured servitude was used as a form of contract labor in the British colonies of North America. Large numbers of German, English, and Scottish colonists arrived in North America as indentured servants. Some of them had been convicted criminals at home. The shortage of labor in the colonies occasionally led to people being kidnapped in Europe and transported to the Americas as indentured servants. The normal term of a contract was from four to seven years, after which the servant became free. This kind of contract was one means by which people too poor to come to the colonies were able to pay for their transportation. Contracts were often made with ship captains who, upon arrival in North America, sold the contracts to someone else."

Democrats on the committee suggested Gowdy's line of questioning was unfair and politically motivated.\n\n\"If you think we've heard about Sidney Blumenthal, wait for the next round!\" Gowdy declared before abruptly calling a recess in the middle of the marathon hearing.\n\nGowdy questioned why Clinton exchanged so many emails with Blumenthal pertaining to Libya, even though Blumenthal \"could not get hired by our government... had never been to Libya, [and] had no expertise with Libya.\"\n\n    Hillary Clinton's Benghazi testimony: A viewer's guide\n    What Hillary Clinton will say before the Benghazi panel\n\nGowdy suggested it was suspicious that Blumenthal, \"all the while working with the Clinton Foundation and some pseudo-news entities, had unfettered access to you.\" By contrast, Gowdy said that Clinton's records showed \"not a single email to and from Ambassador [Chris] Stevens,\" the administration's trusted man on the ground in Libya and one of the four Americans killed in the September 11, 2012 attack on a U.S. facility in Benghazi.",

When the hearing opened, she had regarded the chairman, Trey Gowdy, of South Carolina, with irritated skepticism. She looked as if she might say something rash, if not throw something, and perhaps she might have. Nearly three years ago, in a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Benghazi, she lashed out after having been asked many times about U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice\u2019s comments on the Sunday talk shows about what had instigated the attack, on September 11, 2012, in which four Americans, including Chris Stevens, the Ambassador to Libya, died. \u201cWhat difference, at this point, does it make?\u201d Clinton demanded. Out of context, she sounded unmoved by the men\u2019s deaths. Now, in the House hearing, it seemed to dawn on her that the proper response to her Republican interrogators was not outrage but pity.\n\nPeter Roskam, of Illinois, was laying out a scenario in which Clinton\u2019s assumption of a leadership role on Libyan policy \u201cdidn\u2019t come easy,\u201d when he stopped and said, in case he might be overwhelming her, \u201cI can pause while you\u2019re reading your notes from your staff.\u201d Clinton replied, \u201cI can do more than one thing at a time, Congressman\u2014thanks.\u201d A minute or two later, Roskam said, \u201cGo ahead and read the note if you need to.\u201d This time, Clinton laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not done with my question,\u201d Roskam said; he was just doing her a \u201ccourtesy.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d Clinton responded, with a friendly wave of her hand. From then on, she was in control. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that doesn\u2019t fit your narrative, Congressman. I can only tell you what the facts are,\u201d she told Jim Jordan, of Ohio, who is the chairman of the Freedom Caucus.

Fact checking is not censorship, it is more speech. This is a clear attempt to push  companies into moderating content in line with the President\u2019s interpretation of free speech, ahead of a divisive presidential election where social media will be a key campaigning battleground.\u201d\n\nThe Executive Order seeks to undermine protections in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. This shields online intermediaries from liability for what their users say and protects intermediaries\u2019 ability to moderate content on their  platforms. Intermediaries include Internet Service Providers and social media platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. Platforms also have their own free speech rights and their editorial functions are protected under the First Amendment.\n\nMcKew added: \u201cRather than protecting free speech, undermining Section 230 in this way will restrict more speech online. It will make it easier for the government itself to exert the levers of censorship, fundamentally undermining First Amendment rights in the United States.\u201d\n\nThe row between Twitter and the President looks set to intensify after the social media platform marked tweets which threatened the use of force in the wake of civil unrest in Minneapolis as in violation of rules about glorifying violence. This is the first time Twitter uses such a label against a head of state and the US President in particular. In line with Twitter policy, the tweet was not removed as Twitter said it might be in the public interest but the public interest notice \u201climits the ability to engage with the Tweet",

Those groups, which include Islamic extremist organizations and the Real Irish Republican Army, are based overseas rather than in the U.S.\n\nThat designation matters for a variety of legal reasons, not least of which anyone in the United States who lends support to an organization on that list can face terrorism-related charges.\n\nBut \u201cthere is not a domestic equivalent,\u201d said Joshua Geltzer, a former senior counterterrorism official in the Obama White House and founding executive director at the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at the Georgetown University Law Center.\n\nThere have been periodic calls, particularly after mass shootings by white supremacists, to establish a domestic terrorism law, but none has passed.",

The claim appears to point out that: Breathing over and over exhaled air turns into carbon dioxide, which is why we feel dizzy. Some people drive their car with the mask on; that is very dangerous because the stale air can make the driver lose consciousness. It is recommended to use face masks only if you have someone in front or very close, and it is essential to remember to lift it every 10 minutes to continue feeling healthy.",
        "orig_verdict": "MISLEADING While face masks give us protection, they are not the most comfortable apparel as they are still not part of our noses! However, health authorities see them as necessary in the context of a pandemic. And the ones recommended for the public certainly don't make breathing difficult to the extent of rending the user dizzy. Further, we established that intermittent (every 10 minutes) lifting of one's cover is counterproductive; it is a sure means of infection, not protection. And, as for using a mask in a car, it's unnecessary if you are by your lonesome; it becomes imperative, however, if you have company. In truth, whatever discomfort wearing a face mask in public during a pandemic may cause is worth the trouble and only a small price to pay for good health."

Prior to the Federal Reserve System, there had been a national bank*, and Andrew Jackson had made its end one of his key second-term goals.\n\n3. Two assassins attempted to kill Jackson, but no evidence suggests that they were sent by the Bank.**\n\n4. Some people have emphasized the eerie similarities between Lincoln and Kennedy, which are easily explainable.\n\n* There were two national banks, in fact: The 1st Bank of the U.S., which was chartered from 1791-1811 and the 2nd Bank of the U.S., chartered from 1816-1836.\n\n** There is that pesky Booth letter, though.",

Following plasma transfusion, body temperature normalized within 3 days in 4 of 5 patients, the SOFA score decreased, and Pao2/Fio2 increased within 12 days (range, 172-276 before and 284-366 after). Viral loads also decreased and became negative within 12 days after the transfusion, and SARS-CoV-2\u2013specific ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers increased following the transfusion (range, 40-60 before and 80-320 on day 7). ARDS resolved in 4 patients at 12 days after transfusion, and 3 patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment. Of the 5 patients, 3 have been discharged from the hospital (length of stay: 53, 51, and 55 days), and 2 are in stable condition at 37 days after transfusion.\n\nConclusions and Relevance  In this preliminary uncontrolled case series of 5 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS, administration of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody was followed by improvement in their clinical status. The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment, and these observations require evaluation in clinical trials.",

In this work, we explored the feasibility of convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion to rescue severe patients. The results from 10 severe adult cases showed that one dose (200 mL) of CP was welltolerated and could significantly increase or maintain the neutralizing antibodies at a high level, leading to disappearance of viremia in 7 days. Meanwhile, clinical symptoms and paraclinical criteria rapidly improved within 3 days. Radiological examination showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 days. These results indicate that CP can serve as a promising rescue option for severe COVID-19 while the randomized trial is warranted.",

Flavonoids extracted from black bamboo leaves have potent antioxidant activities (Hu et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2002). Among these flavonoids, flavone c-glucosides and p-coumaric acid reportedly have long retention time in the colon and may contribute to free radical scavenging (Zhang et al., 2007). Luteolin 6-C-(6\u2033-O-trans-caffeoylglucoside), an antioxidant isolated from the leaves, has been reported to protect against oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity in retinal ganglion cells (Lee et al., 2010). It also enhances the activity of aldose reductase and inhibits the formation of advanced glycation end products, and therefore may potentially have a role in the prevention of diabetic complications (Jung et al., 2007).\nOrientin, another antioxidant obtained from the leaves of black bamboo, exerts vaso-relaxant activity through the inhibition of intracellular Ca2+ release and extracellular Ca2+ influx (Fu et al., 2005). Orientin also prevents apoptosis induced by hypoxia and reoxygenation in myocardium and cardiomyocytes. The mechanism for this effect is inhibition of the activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (Fu et al., 2006). These studies suggest potential for cardio-protective effects.\n\nThe acetone fraction of the leaves of Phyllostachys nigra (Lodd.) Munro has been shown to enhance leukemia cell differentiation (Kim et al., 2007b), and inhibit interleukin-12 (IL-12) production in lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages via decreasing NF-kappaB binding activity (Kim et al., 2007a). These preliminary findings suggest potential anti-leukemia and anti-inflammation effects of the acetone extract."

Influenza A viruses were the predominant circulating viruses last year. While influenza A(H1N1pdm09) viruses predominated from October 2018 \u2013 mid February 2019, influenza A(H3N2) viruses were more commonly reported starting in late February 2019. Influenza B viruses were not commonly reported among circulating viruses during the 2018\u20132019 season. The season had moderate severity based on levels of outpatient influenza-like illness, hospitalizations rates, and proportions of pneumonia and influenza-associated deaths.\n\nCDC estimates that the burden of illness during the 2018\u20132019 season included an estimated 35.5 million people getting sick with influenza, 16.5 million people going to a health care provider for their illness, 490,600 hospitalizations, and 34,200 deaths from influenza (Table 1). The number of influenza-associated illnesses that occurred last season was similar to the estimated number of influenza-associated illnesses during the 2012\u20132013 influenza season when an estimated 34 million people had symptomatic influenza illness6.\n\nPeak activity during the 2018\u20132019 influenza season was classified as having moderate severity across ages in the population. Compared with the 2017\u20132018 season , which was classified as high severity, the overall rates and burden of influenza were much lower during the 2018\u20132019 season (Table 2). Among children, however, rates of influenza during the 2018\u20132019 season were similar to the 2017\u20132018 season. In addition, the 2018\u20132019 season had two waves of activity, including a wave predominated by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses and another wave of similar magnitude attributable to influenza A(H3N2) viruses5. The dual waves resulted in a protracted season during 2018\u20132019 that was less severe when compared with peak activity in 2017\u20132018, but r",

Just three have legislated vaccination policies, applying strictly to children about to enrol in school. Ontario and New Brunswick require immunization for diphtheria, tetanus, polio, measles, mumps, and rubella immunization, while Manitoba requires a measles vaccination.\n\nIn each case, though, the legislation includes an exemption clause. Essentially, each of the three provinces allows parents to request that their child be exempted from the vaccination requirement on medical or religious grounds, or simply out of conscience. In such instances, in the event of a disease outbreak, unvaccinated children can be excluded from entering a school.",

Wash your hands before putting on your face covering, put it over your nose and mouth and secure it under your chin, and try to fit it snugly against the sides of your face. Make sure you can still breathe easily.\n\nHand washing: The most well-established way to prevent respiratory infections such as influenza and coronavirus is frequent and thorough hand washing with soap and water. Scrub your hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\n\nHand sanitizer: Handwashing with soap and water is the best way to reduce germs, but if they are not available, alcohol-based hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol can help to reduce the spread of infection. Note: avoid any products containing triclosan, a known hormone-disrupting chemical.\n\nCovering your mouth and nose: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing; if your hands are not free or you don\u2019t have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your sleeve, not your bare hands.\n\nNot touching your face: Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands, which can help provide the virus with a route of entry into the body. Since the average individual touches their face an average of 15 times per hour, remain vigilant!\n\nKeeping surfaces clean: Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces, especially when someone is ill. Surfaces to consider include doorknobs, phones, computer keyboards, remotes, and other surfaces that are frequently touched in rooms such as the bathroom and kitchen.\nLifestyle\n\nStress reduction: Chronic stress can negatively alter immune system responses, making you more likely to get sick. Identify your personal stress reduction strategies and practice them regularly.\n\nSleep: Sleep has a big influence on immune function, so it is es",

                        "answer": "COVID-19 can be transmitted by people with the virus coughing or sneezing, releasing tiny contaminated droplets into the air, putting anyone within range in danger of inhaling them. These droplets can travel more than a metre from the infected person, allowing them to settle on any surfaces ready to be transferred to anyone that touches the surface.\n\nThe virus can live on some surfaces for several days. Data from the 2003 SARS outbreak, which was a similar illness to the latest coronavirus, showed the virus could contaminate plastered walls for up to a day and a half, plastic and stainless steel for 72 hours, and glass for 96 hours. So it\u2019s likely the mobile phone, tablet or computer screen you are reading this on could harbour COVID-19 for up to four days, and be transferred to anyone touching the screen.\n\nAdopting good hygiene is one of the most effective weapons to slow or prevent the virus spreading. Here are six things you can do to protect yourself and others.\n\n\n1. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth\n\nOur hands touch door handles, keyboards, taps and numerous other surfaces, so the virus could easily be picked up this way. Rubbing tired eyes or touching your nose or mouth could transfer the virus from your hands into your body.\n\n2. Wash your hands regularly\n\nClean your hands thoroughly and often, using plenty of soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub to kill any virus on your hands. Scrub for at least 20 seconds, making sure you clean fingers, thumbs and palms.\n\n\n\n3. Practise respiratory hygiene\n\n\nIf you cough or sneeze, use a tissue and throw it in the trash afterwards. If you don\u2019t have a tissue, cough into the crook of your arm instead of using your hand. If possible, avoid coughing or sneezing near other people.\n\n4. Maintain social distancing\n\nBe aware of people around you and keep your distance from anyone coughing or sneezing. Stay at least 1 metre away to prevent inhaling the small liquid droplets sprayed by coughs and sneezes.",

Based on the idea that disease is due to an imbalance or stress in a person's consciousness, Ayurveda encourages certain lifestyle interventions and natural therapies to regain a balance between the body, mind, spirit, and the environment.\n\nAyurveda treatment starts with an internal purification process, followed by a special diet, herbal remedies, massage therapy, yoga, and meditation.",

In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging. You should always handle and prepare food safely, including keeping raw meat separate from other foods, refrigerating perishable foods, and cooking meat to the right temperature to kill harmful germs.

Also, there are no reports that doctors in China are serving tea to Covid-19 patients.\nWe found a news report by China Daily related to this topic.\nAccording to this report, researchers from the Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention found through experiments that because of its chemical components, drinking tea could help prevent novel coronavirus infections.\nBut later the article was removed by the Zhejiang CDC on February 26, China Daily reported.\nOn checking FDA website it is found that tea is among the fraudelent product to cure Covid-19",

The Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, used the fatality rate of coronavirus with known numbers and used this as his prediction of eventual mortality rate.  This was a faulty assumption.  Estimates usually involve obtaining information that is available and making estimates on what is not. We cannot tell the future but we can make educated guesses based on information available. This is what has been done with the coronavirus because this type of virus has apparently never been seen before.\n\n2. Sometimes estimates are reasonable and sometimes they are wrong, and even way off.\nAdvertisement - story continues below\n\nThe point is that whenever estimates are made of large unknown values they are always wrong because no one can tell the future. Sometimes estimates end up close and sometimes they are not and sometimes they are way off.\n\n3. The current \u201cestimate\u201d for the coronavirus fatality rate according to the WHO is about 3.4%.\nThe estimate used most often is from the WHO based on the Director General\u2019s comments.  The WHO estimates the mortality rate of the coronavirus to be around 3.4%:\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated the mortality rate from Covid-19 is about 3.4%. That is higher than seasonal flu and is cause for concern \u2013 but even if it is correct, more than 96% of people who become infected with the coronavirus will recover.\n\nAdvertisement - story continues below\n\n4.

The salt works to remove mucus from your inflamed tissue. A salt water gargle can be made by mixing 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of salt to 8 ounces of warm water. You can do this a few times a day as needed. \n\nApple Cider Vinegar \n\nThere are a few different ways to use apple cider vinegar to soothe your sore throat. You can create an apple cider vinegar gargle by mixing 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar with \u00bd teaspoon of salt and 8 ounces of warm water. Another way to use apple cider vinegar is to mix it with honey and warm water. It can also be used in teas, with green tea or licorice root tea.",

A CDC notice advised Americans who\u2019d been in Wuhan and felt sick to seek care.\n\nOn Jan. 17, the U.S. began checks of passengers from Wuhan at airports in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n\nTwo days later, the recent arrival from Wuhan visited the urgent-care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, and the intensive response began. In retrospect, it was already too late. Some researchers who\u2019ve traced the viral genomes of patients around the world now believe someone else in the area picked it up between Jan. 15 and Jan. 19, before the traveler went to the hospital. He might have sneezed in the airport shuttle or on some surface\u2014all but impossible for health workers to trace.\n\n\u201cThis virus is more contagious than the flu, so any sort of exposures before he got to the hospital would be certainly of high concern,\u201d said George Diaz, who leads the infectious disease department at Providence, where the patient was treated.",

Hayden served as director of the CIA from 2006 to Feb. 12, 2009, shortly after Obama took office.\n\nBen Rhodes, former deputy national security adviser to Obama, added his voice on Twitter as well: \u201cTrump is lying. I was there for all 8 years. Obama never sought a meeting with Kim Jong Un. Foreign policy isn\u2019t reality television it\u2019s reality.\u201d\n\nRhodes told CNN that Obama \u201cnever even considered\u201d seeking a meeting with Kim. \u201cThere\u2019s no mystery here: It\u2019s just a lie with no supporting evidence and no basis in anything. It\u2019s not even an exaggeration, it\u2019s just not true.\u201d\n\nAnd on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d James Clapper, who served as director of national intelligence for most of Obama\u2019s presidency, said he was puzzled by Trump\u2019s claim. \u201cIn all the deliberations that I have participated in on North Korea during the Obama administration, I can recall no instance whatever where President Obama ever indicated any interest whatsoever in meeting with the \u2014 Chairman Kim,\u201d Clapper said.\n\nWe reached out to the Trump press office, but it did not provide any further information.\n\nIt\u2019s true that during a debate in the run-up to the 2008 presidential election, Obama famously said that he would be willing to meet with leaders in North Korea and other enemy nations without any preconditions.",
