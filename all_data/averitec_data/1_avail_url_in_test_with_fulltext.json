Because he will find an easy way to do it.\"", "orig_verdict": "False", "fulltext": "Bill Gates Says Lazy People Make the Best Employees. But Is Your Laziness Actually Masking a Deeper Issue? You're not lazy. But there's something else wrong.\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\nBill Gates thinks you should hire lazy people. No, seriously. He famously said, \"I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.\"\nI don't disagree with the premise. Choosing a person who will do a job the \"easy way\" and solve the difficult problem in front of them can be better than putting your most ambitious team on it. The hardest way is often not the best way. In fact, in the startup world, over delivering can be just as dangerous as under delivering when time and money are finite resources and a lesser solution would have solved the problem effectively. Picking the lowest hanging fruit does not make a person lazy, nor does taking the more obvious path, nor does actually taking vacation. It makes them good at prioritization, efficient workers and more resilient people.\nCategorizing all of these behaviors as lazy is non-specific, reductive and, well, lazy. But it's an easy word to assign, both to ourselves and to others. A colleague missed a deadline despite having ample time? Lazy. We'd rather sleep in than go to the gym? Lazy. But, it's not that simple. Laziness is not the problem; it's a symptom. We often resist seeing it that way, because the deeper reasons for our hesitation to take action can be uncomfortable truths.\nWe need to examine them anyway. They're actually what's holding us back, not laziness.\nFirst things first\nFeeling lazy is often a sign we need rest. I want to make one thing clear: Rest does not equal laziness.\nIt's a common misconception. They often look similar. Relaxing instead of working, prioritizing personal tasks over professional or not waking up at 6 a.m. can all read as canonically lazy. Tech culture at large has this problem: The perception of productivity is more important than actual productivity.\nSometimes, the most productive thing you can do is rest. As I've written before, rest is critical for productivity. Rest is a partner of work. One cannot get done without the other. Resting during the workday, like on a long walk, can be powerful in generating creative ideas. Longer breaks are critical in preventing burnout. What may look laziness deceptively makes you better.\nThe secret is, when you rest, really rest. Don't check Slack from your phone. Don't respond to email on your vacation. Truly take the space for restorative rest — and give your colleagues that space as well. You'll likely come back motivated and better equipped to work.\nWhat else can feeling lazy tell us?\nYou're well-rested, well-hydrated, in your peak hours and still having trouble getting motivated. Does that make you lazy?\nIt's not that simple.\nLack of motivation is something a lot of us berate ourselves for as a personal failing. Instead of hurling insults at the mirror, what if we started from a place of curiosity? Try asking yourself why you're avoiding certain tasks. Don't settle for the easy answers. Maybe you're not that inspired by your job right now because you aren't learning anything new. Maybe you're afraid of the discomfort that comes with progress, like at the gym, or of failure itself, like with a passion project that might not lead to anything.\nThose are more complex problems to solve than laziness. To address them in others, you must come from a place of deep empathy. It's not easy to talk about fears of inadequacy or losing meaning in your work. It's a human problem, not an outcomes problem, but it does impact output. Connecting with others at work makes people more productive. Plus, by working from a place of curiosity rather than assumptions of laziness, you're staying on the same side of the problem.\nTo address these problems in yourself, you have to evaluate the information gathered from interrogating your so-called laziness. Identifying what's holding you back, whether it's perfectionist tendencies or low self-efficacy, is the first step towards taking action.\nThe risk of laziness is that it will turn into stagnation. You have to make choices that address the root cause. You won't just be more productive. You might even be happier. That matters, not only because you're a person who deserves happiness, but because people who are happy at work are more successful. Emotional influences thinking, so if you're more fulfilled at work, your thoughts and actions will follow.\nSo, what do we do about it?\nCapitalize on the progress principle. The progress principle states that \"of all the things that can boost emotions, motivation and perceptions during a workday, the single most important is making progress in meaningful work.\" Feeling a sense of progress and taking joy in the small wins can help battle that voice in your head that says that the work is too difficult or the project is too big to tackle.\nHit the reset button with a nap. Studies show that a 30-minute nap can stop performance deterioration in its tracks. A 60-minute nap can reverse it. If you're feeling lazy, it could be your cue to rest. Remember: The perception of busyness is not the same as productivity. Your time truly might be better spent on a quick snooze.\nShift your focus. Lack of meaning in your work is a primary contributing factor to diminished motivation. If you don't want — or are not in a position — to make a big change, take note of the people your work has an impact on, not just what you produce. This shifts the focus from the tasks you need to accomplish to how you can help people, both internally and externally.\nActually do less. Especially as a founder, doing less can feel terrifying. It was for me, until I realized that the work I was putting off was work I really shouldn't be doing in the first place. It felt lazy to move things off my plate, but now, those tasks are being done with enthusiasm by someone who knows a lot more about it than I do, and I have the time to do the work that excites me."}, {"claim": "COVID 19 bacteria is caused due to 5g electromagnetic radiation.", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Refuted", "justification": "No evidence found by who", "claim_date": "12-7-2021", "speaker": "Chowkidar Ravichiruvolu", "original_claim_url": "https://twitter.com/Ravichiruvolu1/status/1271497871292985344", "fact_checking_article": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200921145614/https://newsmeter.in/fact-check-video-claims-that-covid-19-is-a-bacteria-and-can-be-treated-by-antibiotics-are-false/", "reporting_source": "Twitter", "location_ISO_code": "IN", "claim_types": ["Causal Claim"], "fact_checking_strategies": ["Written Evidence"], "questions": [{"question": "Is SARS-CoV-2 a bacteria", "answers": [{"answer": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible for the current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19)", "answer_type": "Extractive", "source_url": "https://coronavirusexplained.ukri.org/en/article/cad0003/", "source_medium": "Web text"}]}, {"question": "Can viruses travel on radio waves or mobile phone network", "answers": [{"answer": "the World Health Organization (WHO), have reviewed the extensive available research on electromagnetic fields and health and have consistently concluded that there is no evidence of any health effects associated with radio wave exposure from either mobile phones or radio base stations.", "answer_type": "Extractive", "source_url": "https://www.ericsson.com/en/about-us/sustainability-and-corporate-responsibility/responsible-business/radio-waves-and-health/qa", "source_medium": "Web text"}]}], "orig_claim": "COVID 19 is a bacteria can be treated by antibiotics", "orig_verdict": "False", "fulltext": "My Goodness is this true?

That means when you exhale through N95 the design is that you are exhaling into contamination. The exhale from N95 masks are vented to breath straight out without filtration. They don’t filter the air on the way out. They don’t need to. Conclusion: if you’re in Stewart’s and the guy with Covid has N95 mask his covid breath is unfiltered being exhaled into Stewart’s (because it was designed for already contaminated environments, it’s not filtering your air on the way out) . • Surgical Mask: these masks were designed and approved for STERILE environments. The amount of particles and contaminants in the outside and indoor environments where people are CLOGG these masks very Very quickly. The moisture from your breath combined with the clogged mask with render it “useless” IF you come in contact with Covid and your mask traps it You become a walking virus dispenser. Everytime you put your mask on you are breathing the germs from EVERYWHERE you went. They should be changed or thrown out every “20-30 minutes in a non sterile environment” . Cloth masks: today three people pointed to their masks as the walked by me entering Lowe’s. They said “ya gotta wear your mask BRO” I said very clearly “those masks don’t work bro, in fact they MAKE you sicker” the “pshh’d” me. . By now hopefully you all know CLOTH masks do not filter anything.  . You mean the American flag one my aunt made? Yes. The one with sunflowers that looks so cute? Yes. The bandanna, the cut up t-shirt, the scarf . ALL of them offer NO FILTERING whatsoever. As you exhale you are ridding your lungs of contaminants and carbon dioxide.  . Cloth masks trap this carbon dioxide the best!!!! It actually risks health. !!!!! The moisture caught in these masks can become mildew ridden over night. Dry coughing, enhanced allergies, sore throat are all symptoms of a micro-mold in your mask. . Ultimate Answer: N95 blows the virus into the air from a contaminated person. . The surgical mask is not designed for the outside world and will not filter the virus upon inhaling through it. It’s filtration works on the exhale. (Like a vacuum bag it only works one way) .

One of the vaccines s the Comirnaty COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (also known as the ‘Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine’).\nWhat is mRNA?\n\nRibonucleic acid (RNA) is the genetic material in viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 virus). Once inside a human cell, SARS-CoV-2 RNA acts as messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), which is a type of molecule used by the virus as instructions for making the proteins it needs to function. Human cells generate mRNA for the same purpose.\nHow do mRNA vaccines work?\n\nVaccines prepare the body to defend itself against a specific disease. mRNA vaccines contain pieces of mRNA that tell the cells in the body how to make a viral protein that will be recognised by the immune system as foreign.\n\nIn this case, the mRNA contains instructions for the spike (S) protein on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The S protein helps the virus enter human cells.\n\nCopies of the S protein are made in the body. The immune system recognises the S protein copies as foreign and makes immune cells and antibodies which can recognise and attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus via the S protein.\n\nThe mRNA is broken down shortly after vaccination. Animal studies showed that the mRNA in the Comirnaty vaccine is broken down within a couple of weeks.\n\nIf the body is later exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the immune system is prepared to defend the body against illness. As a result some people may not get infected at all. Others will experience a much milder illness than they would have done without the vaccine.", "answer_type": "Extractive", "source_url": "https://www.medsafe.govt.nz/COVID-19/mRNA-vaccines.asp", "source_medium": "Web text"}]}, {"question": "Does the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines turns human body to virus making factory ?", "answers": [{"answer": "Vaccines train the immune system to recognize the disease-causing part of a virus. Vaccines traditionally contain either weakened viruses or purified signature proteins of the virus.\n\nBut an mRNA vaccine is different, because rather than having the viral protein injected, a person receives genetic material – mRNA – that encodes the viral protein. When these genetic instructions are injected into the upper arm, the muscle cells translate them to make the viral protein directly in the body.\n\nThis approach mimics what the SARS-CoV-2 does in nature – but the vaccine mRNA codes only for the critical fragment of the viral protein. This gives the immune system a preview of what the real virus looks like without causing disease. This preview gives the immune system time to design powerful antibodies that can neutralize the real virus if the individual is ever infected.\n\nWhile this synthetic mRNA is genetic material, it cannot be transmitted to the next generation. After an mRNA injection, this molecule guides the protein production inside the muscle cells, which reaches peak levels for 24 to 48 hours and can last for a few more days.", "answer_type": "Extractive", "source_url": "https://theconversation.com/how-mrna-vaccines-from-pfizer-and-moderna-work-why-theyre-a-breakthrough-and-why-they-need-to-be-kept-so-cold-150238", "source_medium": "Web text"}]}], "orig_claim": "The mRNA vaccine is “an operating system that takes over the machinery of your cells” ; “...by the time you get your fourth shot your body will be making all four proteins that make up the COVID-19 virus.”", "orig_verdict": "Inaccurate", "fulltext": "🗣Mindset COACH 👉🏾 Do 4 Self Expert 👉🏾📚8X AUTHOR on Instagram: \"👀👀👀Please believe it! 🗣While men/women slept, an enemy crept in. 🗣Remember the devices that kept being taken out of NEO in The Matrix? 🗣Well this ain’t a movie.

She has been held under military guard at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Center Camp Delta since March 5.\nIn just over a week, the villainous, vile creature will stand before a military tribunal consisting of six U.S. military officers handpicked by Donald J. Trump and his advisory board. A Trump source familiar with the proceedings told RRN that the officers who will serve as both judge and jury cover a broad range of military ranks—from O-3 (captain) to 0-9 (Lt. General)—selected from all branches of U.S. Armed Forces.\n“The choice was not done hastily. Trump’s team spent weeks picking the officers. Trump wanted to remove himself from the equation and ensure that the officers picked were not tainted by any bias for Clinton. No matter what, the odds are stacked against her. A tribunal isn’t an ordinary trial, and Clinton is no longer an American citizen,” our source said.\nStripped of her citizenship, Clinton is no longer afforded the protections of the U.S. Constitution and Geneva Convention. She is a detainee, or enemy combatant, which means she has no rights, not even the right to remain silent. In a military tribunal, silence is equated with guilt.\n“Clinton was asked if she wanted an advocate to speak on her behalf, but the loon said she would defend herself. She decried the whole idea of a military tribunal as lunacy and has been babbling out how her people are going to free her. It doesn’t look good for her. She’s being charged with treason, sedition, assassinations, assassination attempts—the list goes on,” our source said.\nMoreover, Trump has held Clinton responsible for the deaths of four Americans in the Benghazi Massacre: Ambassador Chris Stephens, Information Officer Sean Smith, and CIA contractors Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods, both former U.S. Navy SEALs. Clinton’s inaction led to their deaths; therefore, Trump decreed she must be held to account.\nOur source said Clinton faces one of three possible outcomes: acquittal, life at GITMO, or a firing squad.\nAnd if the military is so patriotic how come the kissy soldiers are like good little tied wimps taking their new death jab,there’s a good girl sorry boy,all talk are pztriots,if I had guns I would be doing my not to end multiculturalism,my last bullet would be for myself,not enough fiesty whites,annoying europeans don’t have guns,you do yet your only talkers,British europeans made sure you had guns,and that was tough to do in first place with dirty Jews about,your wasting your gift of survival,just chat chat chat,end multi cultural already ,construct any new non white or trimp,trust only 100 percent know for sure whi t e right and end this shit,just chat chat chat all the time\nI would be wary that this is even true,for xxxxs sake just with your guns take back your country\nA titillating read and the thought of this being true makes me incredibly happy but well we know this is bs. And what a ghastly pic of her. What is wrong with her mouth always contorted.\nWhy are you the only one mentioning anything about hrc?\nHow should I know. I can’t speak for people who are not reporting it.\nSimon Parkes mentioned her arrest two days after it was announced here and he also touched on it in an interview he did with Doug Billings for one of “The Right Side” broadcasts.\nSimon also recently said that anyone who really knows anything about what’s going on is either bound under a non-disclosure agreement or has been asked to keep it to themselves. He said that the “bad guys” are so starved for information, they are combing through posts on social media to try to find out what’s going on so they can counter it. In this case, silence is golden until it is time for it to come out in the open and I am waiting for that time to arrive.\nSimon is the only other person whose information stands up over time and is validated by how things actually occur. I don’t trust or follow anyone else except RRN as being worth my time and attention.\nWhat are your sources saying now?\nWhile waiting to hear what comes of this, I found an article online that summarized the rules for military tribunals in a chart published by the New York Times on March 21, 2021: https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/stories/rules-for-military-tribunals\nAccording to that chart, the composition of the jury for a military tribunal consists of “Three to seven military officers appointed by the military. Seven members required for death penalty cases.” Since your source said that only six officers were picked for Hillary’s trial, that would suggest that the death penalty will not be sought, which would only leave acquittal or life in prison as the two possible outcomes.\nYour thoughts on this?\nThis six was mistake. It’s only 3.\nSo, from that chart, the death penalty is not even being considered. I must say that that’s disappointing, and I hope it doesn’t lead to yet another book contract for her!\nGitmo military tribunals are governed by The Military Commissions Act of 2006 (not the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and not by the Justice Department). Quoting from it: “CHAPTER V. MILITARY COMMISSION COMPOSITION AND PERSONNEL; CONVENING MILITARY COMMISSION Rule 501. Composition and personnel of military commission (a) Composition of a military commission. (1) A non-capital military commission shall consist of a military judge and at least five members. (2) Subject to the provisions of subsection (3), a capital military commission shall consist of a military judge and at least twelve members.\nAs to the voice below, Yes! Simon Parkes also spoke of the HRC arrest. For myself, I WANT both sets of dots (Mr. Baxter’s dots and Mr. Parkes’ dots). Since the news is dead, we cannot become too picky. In fact, the news was probably dead circa year 2000 and was a “media zombie” with good makeup & we never noticed. Keep up the good work, Mr. Baxter and I’ll not quibble over warranties either express nor implied. MAGA\nIf someone is labeled a non uniformed enemy combatant, then they are a spy and can be executed on the spot without a trial. Trump is at liberty to walk right up to these people a blow their head of. These trials are a gift that would never be reciprocated, if the shoe was on the other foot.\nSo…\nA tribunal has three judges. Tri = three.\nSix judges and you have a hexunal.\nActually, the Latin root “tribunus” means the platform on which the judges did their work.\nWell today is April 8th. I am anxiously awaiting the confirmation that the bitch has been found guilty and is awaiting execution by a firing squad which is the proper death of a traitor.\nDoes anyone know what time the trial starts today? I assume there will be an updated article later today or tomorrow with the results of the trial.\nAs soon as I know anything, I will report.\nStill waiting…\nHopefully…all is, or is about to be actually happening !!! Way too late !!!\nWhew?\nI take notice of the info and really want it to be true but will believe it when its publicly released.\nThat thumbnail would be complete with a stick of dynamite in her evil grill?\nThey will not be doing anything at Guantanamo Bay because t is closing.\nGreat Story!\nNo one loses their citizenship without a trial and conviction. If hillary is detained and is not a clone then she is still a US citizen. That repeat through various articles throws everything by this author into doubt.\nHilary is no different than Anwar al-Awlaki.\nAccording to Amg-news.com and Dark Out Post post. The REAL CLINTONS Have already been executed. So what are we seeing her cabal double being arrested and tired now? This thing gets crazier and crazier. Or is this just something for the public to hear about now with the outcome being hanging.that is how killary actually was executed\nI definitely believe that we the people should bear witness to these executions. I say hanging, it’s more painful.\nMr. Baxter. Can you ask your sources for news of the first day of the tribunal? These days, all belief can only be metaphysical since belief itself has been overturned. Therefore, new dots, commonplace observations by others that ring true in us, will sustain belief. And, God help us, how we need belief in these days.\nIt’s her clone\nIm hoping that evidence against these people will be publicised, otherwise the normal man in the street wont believe it.\nPersonally I think Clinton and those like her, should be executed, otherwise in a few years when everything has died down, they will be paying guards at Gitmo to bring little Cuban kids into the jail for their satanical rituals.\nBy the way, where is Bill? Hes certainly not innocent, especially of rape etc of children.\nIm worried about all these unaccompanied children coming in from SA. God help them.\nGet some help. You are insane.\nInsane? Have you seen what is going on down at the southern border? Children are being dropped off like dirty laundry at the cleaners and then shipped off to who knows where. Insane? Your insane for not accepting the truth of what is happening down there even when you see for yourself.\nI’ ll believe it when I see it.So far I’ve seen too many ENQUIRER type stories that never come to fruition.\nHow would the public react to all this info that is claimed to be false? Shock, awe, fear, anger? All the above. We the people would be storming the streets with pitchforks looking for the devils who harm children. Remember, united we are strong, divided we are weak. The one true thing that would unite all of the world is the saving of the children, a united world can achieve much which is what “they” dont want. All lives matter.\nIn past times they used to burn at the stake this kind of witches.\nOdd, she was just on a Podcast with Jennifer Palmieri. I guess the podcast is just a psyop ???. Or, she’s broadcasting from GITMO!!!\nor……she is a clone or it is wearing a skin mask, I say skin mask\nOh 1 other thing, that makes me think, is the only 1 talking about china is trump. And right now i bet most of u have something from there, with hardware and software in it u cant get to. Iv been finding countless things. Simple crap like a usb memory stick. The damn thing is twins when it plugs in, as if its 2 different sticks, its got close to a gig less space you CANNOT get to, and you cant format it completely. Usb microscope i just got has some of the same super wierd things going on, and zero devices work right after using it. 1 of my laptops has gone nuts, i cant even do a system recovery on it, it straight says no. Russia is a big wolf to watch for sure, but china seems to be the real biden killer bee’s, that isnt fake news, cuz its in my lap\nEVERYTHING IS FROM THERE!!!!!!\nSee though iv been hearing for years and years crazy outlandish, story book horror stories that may have had truths but u couldnt see the big picture. Little things that piece all those crazy stories together push that its based on truth. All stories are embellished, thats human nature, and perception is blinding to those perceiving. But when he says she was acting like an addict, with no drugs in her system, and 3 blood types, which a very simple conclusion medically is adrenaline usage, i think about the crazy stories about her being a witch and killing kids for the power in thier blood. Likely way blown out of proportion, hopefully, but using terrified children for adrenaline is a thing, it does kill, and is extremely addictive, and fits with many many things said past and present, especially being involved with pharmaceutical scum. We all know those “people” care about nothing but profit, every other tv commercial is another lawsuit for deaths and injury due to meds they knew about but didnt care. You cant think they only go so far with that much power. If your willing to do what we know about, the darkness we dont know yet will likely make you cry yourself to sleep, and its all possible because they are good at making us numb, keeping our eyes on a million things of no consequence, and afraid of crap that even if it was real we should be FIGHTING. Covid is a lie. I said it from the start, fear tactics. But thats the thing, thats the point, look at this and all this discussion over crap we arent gunna touch and dont know what to do with, so we’ll continue to think this or that and bitch online or read crap till we get sidetracked with life purposefully made difficult and full of fruitless mundane repetitive crap, and nothing will be different, WHATEVER is going on. What we DO know is the base foundation of either side of lifes coin; destruction, and creation. Just like bad men only win when good men dont stand, destroying only goes so far, creating can be endless. The evils in the world know it, they dont want the good gone, just subservient, obedient cattle who wander aimless. If they won theyd end with us. So what im hoping some will read and understand, what im trying to say, here cuz in life im so very lost to all of you, just fucking live and create. Love. Smile a sad smile in the face of the ass hats, wish they could be the same, let it go and live how we were meant to. Thats how to win, if you want it u just have to know it. I promise you those sad dark souls like hilary know already. Thats why we are made not to. We cant win if we either dont know theres something to win, or that we won before it even started. Idk what else to say but open that eye kids and breathe in life so shit can go back to how it was meant to be, cuz this is just painful to watch. Thats my rant, itd be easier if i could just slap every1s eyes open, but even jesus had to work for it. And no im not religious, but the dude existed and said much the same, tho your only fed drops of the truth of his time. You focused on race especially, theres a time and place, now isnt it, thats another sword the ass hats use. Its useful cuz its painful and serious, your letting it work for them, so stop. Enough of those who would have been the enemy there all those years ago are now allies, enough to deal with it when times are appropriate, not in the middle of a damn comic book where trump is freakin super man. Whoulda thunk. Trump. Cant stand him but id follow the bastard to hell and back after this. Peace\nfuckin’ A, bro. I’m witchya. don’t panic, it’s organic.\nIt will be the best birthday present ? I ever received.\nhappy birthday!?\nAccording to a Washington Times report, dated March 30, 2021, a Hillary Clinton interview will be released, during which she slammed Republicans on gun control issues. Since this is not a live TV appearance, I cannot take it as evidence that she is actually a free person. In the meantime, allegations of her arrest and subsequent transfer to Gitmo have yet to be confirmed. However, the fact that Mr. Baxter has released quite a few unflattering reports on Deep State players seems to suggest something is going on. For instance, former CIA director John Brennan has been a frequent guest on CNN, but according to Mr. Baxter, Brennan today stays in a Gitmo jail cell. Did anyone see Brennan on CNN or MSNBC lately? Let’s wait and see if he shows up again.\nShe could still be a hologram.\nIf anyone watched the more recent so called interview with the person claiming to be Hillary w/ her appatent volunteered presence one could easily see the repetitious kind of mimicking of Hilly style….similar to the earlier one with that poseur wearing the longer hair flip. But the one allegedly posed at the Chappaqua home is easily seen to be fake w/ green field behind the character. You can see the obvious outline around the figure and the pillow she is sitting in front of while moving back and forth herself never moves even a tiny bit. It’s really not that hard to examine. The left is now blatantly obvious.\nBTW, Simon Parkes and “Before It’s News” both have info reports and links on the cargo ship of the Suez lock down being examined w/ findings of children in the cargo containers: Simon:\nWith great regret I must announce that children were being transported in cargo containers.\nThe operation in the Suez Canal was a success and warrants me to do a video update…\nmr. baxter speaks my language.\nWashington Examiner just posted an article with her quoting republicans/gun owners. So…. did she talk to them from gitmo?\nI did a search as to whether she’s been seen since then and she has a public Zoom with Pelosi the next day to celebrate Women’s Day. Being curious, I pulled up the pictures of her on the call that day versus what she looked like at previous appearances. Personally, I might not care for her, but I just don’t think she would wear her hair like that. It’s terribly unflattering and she historically is always well put together. Also, massive cheek bones are relatively new….did she have work done? If so, please fire that plastic surgeon. It’s a hard pill to swallow but would definitely be a step in the right direction toward sunlight.\nIt was reported that Hillary and Kamala had plastic surgery around the same time last year.\nabout time…\nWE ARE EITHER FOOLS, OR THIS MR. BAXTER IS REPORTING WHAT HE BELIEVES TO BE TRUE FROM HIS SOURCE.\nI CALLED HIM A SHILL, I MIGHT REGRET THAT POST, BECAUSE I ASK THE QUESTION, WHY WOULD HE PUT HIS JOURNALISTIC REPUTATION ON THE LINE…STICKING HIS NECK OUT LIKE THIS ? FROM MY RESEARCH.. EPSTEIN’S DEATH WAS A JOKE.. HE IS ALIVE. THE DRONE ATTEMPT ON TRUMP’S LIFE..I BELIEVE TOOK PLACE. ETC\nSO, MICHAEL I TAKE BACK MY STATEMENT… I’M A BELIEVER..PATIENCE.. WE WILL NOT AS ACOUNTRY ALLOW TREASON.. AND CORRUPTION ..EVIL TO RULE THE US. THE MILITARY HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO DEFEND US DOMESTICALLY AND ABROAD… HAVE SOME FAITH.\nIt is indeed hard to understand how the military can look at all the crap the Biden admin is leaving at every corner and just stay subdued. They live in the same country as we all do and need to bear the consequences..\nUS Marines report directly to the POTUS and the POTUS is Donald John Trump as we speak and comment here.\nYes and amen, couldn’t have said it better myself.\nGod bless America\nwhat are your sources\nMr. Baxter. Thanks for this! I choose to believe your account. When Descartes tried to separate the real from the unreal in his “Six Meditations on First Philosophy” (1640 A.D.), he did not have to grapple with “Photoshop” nor with “CGI.” Today, the connection of dots leading toward intuitive decision making means that each person becomes their own editor.\nWhere’s Bill to rescue his damsel in distress??\nHe was too busy at the Empowering Women Conference with Kamila…….That is the only thing that makes me think it might be true they have her in Gitmo. We all know Hillary would have been there and not sent Bill.\nWill this be televised on pay-per-view?\nI heard everyone that was executed was filmed making their confession and their execution.\n90% went with lethal injection the others were hung or fed a bullet.\nThought she was hung 3.16.21? Why waste tax $$ on a contrived trial that all involved are compromised ~ Have some faith in Trump, but, have read dirt on him also. The deep state will have ringers in her trial. She’ll be like Gina Haspel, living the good life while other heroes suffered @ her whim. Need to have DNA verification, then prime time public execution! All Satanists, pedophiles, adrenochrome users~ waste of time with the trial. Use the new electronic guillotines to give the public some variety.\nSome of this stuff is made up – so I just have to assume everything I read is possibly not true. I say “possibly” because I just wish some of it were true. It’s hard to comprehend that Pence was hiding out in a remote cabin and escaped capture, is on the run. Who’s gullible enough to believe that Princess Diana and JFK Jr. are still alive. At that point is when I said, “yeah right, I don’t trust this info.\nanymore.” Who’s so stupid to believe that? lol\nThe question remains, though, do you have anything more uplifting to tell?\nCathryn, I needed to laugh out loud this morning. I stand with you. Let’s not believe any of this crap any longer. They’re all making money off of our reviews on whatever site they’re posting this madness to.\nyou never know. They did have many people wanting to kill them. I wonder about George Floyd being dead. So who knows. I guess we will have it reveled one way or another when the time is right. Epstein isn’t dead either FYI. he was supposed to testify and escaped so their is a 10million bounty on his head. Dead or alive this time. When he is ca8I am sure he will be executed anyway\nA pre-snowflake English punishment for treason was to be Hanged, Drawn and Quartered. The hanging part was not fatal, with the criminal being cut down after strangling for a bit (the hanging was not done with a ‘drop’ causing the neck to break in this case). For someone undergoing adrenochrome withdrawal such non-lethal hanging could cause serious injury, and thus require recovery time before the drawing and quartering could be conducted with maximum awareness on the part of the criminal.\nfake news will NEVER report any of this. Although it would be nice to see her head roll. But I think it would be her double that is filling in for her. Which has to be just as evil if that person is will to be a double for that piece of crap.\nThis despicable traitor will swing at the gallows and will make a BIG difference to Patriots!!\nJUSTICE.\nI thought she had died and then was revived and executed. So many conflicting stories, make it hard to know what is the truth and what is wishful thinking. If this is indeed her, then she should be put before a firing squad, since it is an open and shut case of treason, sedition, crimes against humanity, murder, etc.\nI was thinking the same thing – what can you believe? Right now I’m not believing these stories anymore.\nEverything you have believed in your life was based on faith until it was proven. I would much rather have faith in Trump and his allies in the military than anyone other than God.\nNow, 3.31.21 she’s on Newsmax taking on gun owners and the NRA. Doesn’t look too sick or tired. The question is; CGI, Body double, Clone, real McCoy??\nHow do you KNOW that it was a LIVE broadcast and not a recording? I can answer that question unequivocally. You DON’T! Like I said in a previous post, EVERYTHING we believe is based on faith and I would rather have faith in Trump and our military, whom the VAST majority are loyal to President Trump.\nBody double. She has like 5 of them.\nAND the article also said it was her double who was arrested in Chappaqa! There are lots of pictures of her lookalikes!The best proof is a video with her different accents.If there is something that can´t be hid, is the accent. No matter how much one trains to contain it,when people face certain situations,they loose control and the training doesn´t kick in quite he opposite, real nature appears.\nNo offense intended, but where’s the documentation to back up this claim?? We’re constantly asked to take someone’s word that something like this is happening, but no proof is ever given. When people ask, the response is “do your own research”. How does one go about researching claims such as this, exactly?? Just more sensationalism in my book… we’re all tired of it.\nyour right\nIndeed, his right to TROLL.\nyou’re\nExactly. No proof. Even Gateway Pundit and various Youtubers promised us Trump would be re-elected and we know who is now Commander and Thief.\nOnly because the Democrats cheated to get him in office & destroy our country & everything Trump did to make it great ?\nHow does Trump becoming Putin’s bitch make America great?\nDo you?\nno offense intended but it’s true. trump said “we got them all” just the other day.\nOperation Trust was a Bolshevik counterintelligence operation run from 1921 to 1926 by the State Political Directorate of the Soviet Union. The op was aimed at neutralizing opposition by creating the false impression that a powerful group of military leaders had organized to stop the communists’ takeover. Is a similar psy op being perpetrated on Americans so that we will stand by, waiting for “Trump to return to office” and not take action against the Biden Administration as they destroy our country? People raising false hopes, who claim to have secret contacts in the know, have been all over the internet since the election.\nI totally agree w/ your point and it scares the Hell out of me.. My question would be, and I seriously don’t know.. I’ve read that American’s are armed with something like 300 Million Gun’s.. Did the Soviet Citizens have fire arms to protect themselves with and be able fight back with..\nHave you done any research on the Evergreen commercial transportation company out of Canada? Trudeau hid a lot for her. She as well as her husband alone with Rice need to answer for Benghazi!\nSusan Rice needs removed from the political appointment she is now serving.\nTreasonous Bitch needs executed for lying about Bengazi.\nDo you really think CNN, NBC, CBS, ABC, N.Y. TIMES, Washington Post, etc., will ever investigate any of this ??? Where has Obama, Hillary. Bill, etc. Been over the last few months…hiding in the basement ??? Expose them all, and let’s see where this goes !!! I’d love to see them all locked-up and in orange !!!\nGO AWAY TROLL.

Thank you. Thank you. Good afternoon. Before I take questions, I want to give you a progress report to the nation on where we stand 65 days into office here on vaccinations and a few other top priorities for the American people. First on vaccinations. On December 8th, I indicated that I hoped to get 100 million shots in people’s arms in my first 100 days. We met that goal last week by day 58, 42 days ahead of schedule. Now, today I’m setting a second goal and that is, we will, by my 100th day in office, have administered 200 million shots in people’s arms. That’s right, 200 million shots in 100 days. I know it’s ambitious, twice our original goal, but no other country in the world has even come close, not even close to what we are doing. And I believe we can do it.\nJoe Biden: (02:05)\nAnd today, we made a historic investment in reaching the hardest hit and the most vulnerable communities, the highest risk communities as a consequence of the virus by investing an additional $10 billion in being able to reach them. I also set a goal before I took office of getting a majority of schools in K through Eight fully open in the first 100 days. Now, thanks to the enormous amount of work done by our administration, educators, parents, local, state education officials and leaders, a recent Department of Education survey shows that nearly half of the K through Eight schools are open now full-time, five days a week for in-person learning. Not yet a majority, but we’re really close, and I believe in the 35 days left to go, we’ll meet that goal as well. As, of yesterday, more than 100 million payments of $1,400 have gone into people’s bank accounts. That’s real money in people’s pockets, bringing relief instantly almost. And millions more will be getting their money very soon.\nJoe Biden: (03:24)\nOne final note, since we passed the American Rescue Plan, we’re starting to see new signs of hope in our economy. Since it was passed, a majority of economic forecasters have significantly increased their projections on the economic growth that’s going to take place this year. They’re now projecting it will exceed 6%, a 6% growth in GDP. And just this morning, we learned that the number of people filing for weekly unemployment insurance fell by nearly 100,000 persons. This is the first time in a year the number’s fallen below the pre-pandemic high. So there are still too many Americans out of work, too many families hurting, and they still have a lot of work to do. But I can say to you, the American people, help is here and hope is on the way. Now, I’ll be happy to take your questions. Zeke at the Associated Press.\nZeke: (04:43)\nThank you, Mr. President. You mentioned your progress on COVID-19. I’d like to ask you about some of the other issues facing your Presidency. One of the defining challenges you face in the coming months is how to deliver on your promise to Americans on issues like immigration reform, gun control, voting rights, climate change. All of those right now are facing stiff united opposition from Republicans on Capitol Hill. How far are you willing to go to achieve those promises that you made to the American people?\nJoe Biden: (05:12)\nWell, look, when I took office, I decided that it was a fairly basic simple proposition, and that is, I got elected to solve problems and the most urgent problem facing the American people I stated from the outset was COVID-19 and the economic dislocation for millions and millions of Americans. And so that’s why I put all my focus in the beginning, there were a lot of problems, but all my focus on dealing with those particular problems. And the other problems we’re talking about from immigration to guns and the other things you mentioned are longterm problems. They’ve been around a long time, and what we’re going to be able to do, God willing, is now began one at a time to focus on those as well, and whether it’s immigration or guns or a number of other problems that face the country.\nJoe Biden: (06:17)\nBut the fundamental problem is getting people some peace of mind so they can go to bed at night and not stare at the ceiling, wondering where they lost their health insurance, whether they’re going to lose some family member, whether they’re going to be in a position where they’re going to lose their home, because they can’t pay their mortgage, or the millions of people who are going to get thrown out of their homes because of the inability to pay the rent. So we’re going to move on these one at a time, try to do as many simultaneously as we can, but that’s the reason why I focused as I have. And here’s the deal, I think my Republican colleagues are going to have to determine whether or not we want to work together or they decide that the way in which they want to proceed is to just decide to divide the country, continue the politics of division. But I’m not going to do that. I’m just going to move forward and take these things as they come.\nZeke: (07:24)\nA follow-up, Mr. President. Can your presidency be a success if you can’t make progress on those four challenges, climate change, immigration reform, gun control, voting rights?\nJoe Biden: (07:34)\nWell, I plan on making progress on all of them, but that’s going to be for the American people to decide. I doubt whether maybe you did, maybe others did. I thought many of you thought there was no possibility of my getting the plan I got passed, passed without any Republican votes. Pretty big deal. Got passed. Growing economy. People’s lives are changing. So let’s see what happens. All I know, I’ve been hired to solve problems, to solve problems, not create division. Okay. How about, Yamiche?\nYamiche: (08:17)\nThanks so much, Mr. President. You’ve said over and over again that immigrants shouldn’t come to this country right now. This isn’t the time to come. That message is not being received. Instead, the perception of you that got you elected as a moral decent man is the reason why a lot of immigrants are coming to this country and entrusting you with unaccompanied minors. How do you resolve that tension and how are you choosing which families can stay and which can go given the fact that even though with Title 42 there are some families that are staying? And is there a timeline for when we won’t be seeing these overcrowded facilities run by CPB when it comes to unaccompanied minors?\nJoe Biden: (08:55)\nWell, look, I guess I should be flattered people are coming because I’m the nice guy. That’s the reason why it’s happening, that I’m a decent man or however it’s phrased, that that’s why they’re coming, because they know Biden’s a good guy. Truth of the matter is, nothing has changed. As many people came, a 28% increase in children to the border in my administration, 31% in the last year, in 2019, before the pandemic in the Trump administration. It happens every single solitary year. There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March. It happens every year. In addition to that, there is a …. And by the way, does anybody suggest that there was a 31% increase under Trump because he was a nice guy and he was doing good things at the border? That’s not the reason they’re coming.\nJoe Biden: (09:57)\nThe reason they’re coming is that it’s the time they can travel with the least likelihood of dying on the way because of the heat and the desert, number one. Number two, they’re coming because of the circumstances in country, in country. The way to deal with this problem, and I started to deal with it back when I was Vice President putting together a bipartisan plan of over $700 million to do the root causes of why people are leaving. What did Trump do? He eliminated that funding. He didn’t use it. He didn’t do it. And in addition to that, what he did, he dismantled all the elements that exist to deal with what had been a problem and has been continued to be a problem for a long time. He, in fact, shut down the number of beds available. He did not fund HHS to get people to get the children out of those Border Patrol facilities, where they should not be, and not supposed to be more than a few days, a little while.\nJoe Biden: (11:04)\nBut he dismantled all of that, and so what we’re doing now is attempting to rebuild the system that can accommodate what is happening today. And I’d like to think it’s because I’m a nice guy, but it’s not. It’s because of what’s happened every year. Let me say one other thing on this. If you take a look at the number of people are coming, the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of people coming to the border and crossing are being sent back, are being sent back. Thousands, tens of thousands of people who are over 18 years of age and single people, one at a time coming, have been sent back, sent home. We’re sending back the vast majority of the families that are coming. We’re trying to work out now with Mexico their willingness to take more of those families back. That’s what’s happening. They’re not getting across the border. And those who are coming across the border who are unaccompanied children, we’re moving rapidly to try to put in place what was dismantled, as I said.\nJoe Biden: (12:15)\nFor example, of all the children who are coming across the border, over 70% are either 16 or 17 years old. We’re not talking about people ripping babies from mothers arms or a little three-year old standing on the border, less than I think it’s one and a half percent fall in the category of the very young. So what we’re doing is we’re providing for the space again to be able to get these kids out of the border patrol facilities, which no child, no one should be in any longer than 72 hours. And today I went to, for example, I used all the resources available to me went to the Defense Department and the Secretary of Defense has just made available Fort Bliss, 5,000 beds. Be immediately available, 5,000 beds on the Texas border.\nJoe Biden: (13:08)\nSo we’re building back up the capacity that should have been maintained and built upon that Trump dismantled. It’s going to take time. And the other thing we’re doing, I might add, am I giving you too long an answer, because if you don’t want the detail. No, no, but I mean, I don’t know how much detail you want about immigration. Maybe I’ll stop there.\nYamiche: (13:32)\nMy follow-up question is, one, if you could talk a little bit about which families, why they’re being allowed to stay, what the families that are being allowed to stay, why they’re being allowed to stay. In addition to that, when it comes to the filibuster, which is what Zeke was asking about, immigration is a big issue, of course, related to the filibuster, but there’s also Republicans who are passing bill after bill trying to restrict voting rights. Chuck Schumer’s calling it in an existential threat to democracy. Why not back a filibuster rule that at least gets around issues, including voting rights or immigration? Jim Clyburn, someone, of course, who you know very well has backed the idea of a filibuster rule when it comes to civil rights and voting rights?\nJoe Biden: (14:16)\nWell, look, I’m going to deal with all of those problems. The question is, the priorities as they come and land on my plate. Let’s go to the first question you asked, the first of the second questions you’ve asked, and that is, what about dealing with families? Why are some not going back? Because Mexico is refusing to take them back. They’re saying they won’t take them back, not all of them. We’re in negotiations with the President of Mexico. I think we’re going to see that change. They should all be going back, all be going back. The only people we’re not going to let sitting there on the other side of the Rio Grande by themselves with no help are children. And what we’re doing there, and it’s important point to understand, I know you understand it, I don’t mean to say it that way, an important point to focus on, the vast majority of people under the age of 18 coming to the United States come with a telephone number on a wristband or come with a telephone number in their pocket in the United States.\nJoe Biden: (15:21)\nA mother, a father, a close relative, a grandma, or grandpa. What was happening before is it’s taking literally weeks and weeks and maybe even months before anybody’d pick up the phone and call to see if there really was someone there. Well, we’ve set up a system now where within 24 hours there’s a phone call made as that person, that child crosses the border. And then a verification system being put in place as of today to determine quickly whether or not that is a trafficker being called, or that is actually a mom, a dad and or a close relative. They’re establishing that right off the bat if it in fact is mom or-\nJoe Biden: (16:03)\nEstablishing that right off the bat. If it in fact is mom or dad. Dad says, to take the extreme case, “I got a birth certificate.”J Then guess what? We’re getting that kid directly to that parent immediately. And so that’s going to reduce significantly. There’s two ways to reduce child populations in circumstances that are not acceptable, like being held at a border patrol station. One is to get them to the place where they have a relative and set a date as to when the hearing can be held. The second way to do it is put them in a health and human services facility that we’re occupying now, both licensed beds around the country that exists, as well as, for example, federal resources like Fort Bliss, to get them safely in a place where they can be taken care of while they’re fate is determined.\nSpeaker 1: (17:02)\n[inaudible 00:17:02] filibuster.\nJoe Biden: (17:02)\nFilibuster. Filibuster. With regard to the filibuster, I believe we should go back to a position of the filibuster that existed just when I came to the United States Senate 120 years ago. And that is that it used to be required for the filibuster… And I had a card on this. I was going to give you the statistics, but you probably know them. That it used to be that from between 1917 and 1971, the filibuster existed, there were a total of 58 eight motions to break the filibuster, that whole time. Last year alone, there were five times that many. So it’s being abused in a gigantic way. And for example, it used to be, you had to stand there and talk and talk and talk and talk until you collapsed. And guess what? People got tired of talking and tired of collapsing. Filibusters broke down and were able to break the filibuster, get a [inaudible 00:18:05] vote.\nJoe Biden: (18:06)\nSo I strongly support moving in that direction, in addition to having an open mind about dealing with certain things that are just elemental to the functioning of our democracy, like the right to vote, like the basic right to vote. We’ve amended the filibuster in the past. But here’s the deal. As you observed, I’m a fairly practical guy. I want to get things done. I want to get them done consistent with what we promised the American people. And in order to do that in a 50 50 Senate, we’ve got to get to the place where I get 50 votes so that the Vice President of the United States can break the tie, or I get 51 votes without her.\nJoe Biden: (18:52)\nAnd so I’m going to say something outrageous. I’ve never been particularly poor at calculating how to get things done in the United States Senate. So the best way to get something done, if you hold near and dear to you that you like to be able to… Anyway, we’re ready to get a lot done. And if we have to, if there’s complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster, then we’ll have to go beyond what I’m talking about. Okay. Hang on. Sorry. Oh, [inaudible 00:19:36], Ms. Kim.\nMs. Kim: (19:36)\nThank you, Mr. President. To follow up on the filibuster, so do you believe it should take 60 votes to end a filibuster on legislation or 51?\nJoe Biden: (19:51)\nIf we can ed with 51, we would have no problem. You’re going to have to… The existing rule… It’s going to be hard to get a parliamentary ruling that allows 50 votes to end the filibuster, the existence of a filibuster. But it’s not my expertise on what the parliamentary rules on how to get there are. But our preoccupation with the filibuster is totally legitimate. But in the meantime, we got a lot we can do while we’re talking about what we’re going to do with about the filibuster. Let me get here. Okay. Cecilia Vega.\nYamiche: (20:38)\nI’d like to circle back to immigration, please. You just listed the reasons that people are coming, talking about in-country problems, saying that it happens every year. You blamed the last administration, sir. I just got back last night from a reporting trip to the border where I met nine-year-old Josevs who walked here from Honduras by himself along with another little boy. He had that phone number on him and we were able to call his family. His mother says that she sent her son to this country because she believes that you are not deporting unaccompanied minors like her son. That’s why she sent him alone from Honduras. So, sir, you blamed the last administration, but is your messaging and saying that these children are and will be allowed to stay in this country and work their way through this process, encouraging families like Josevs to come?\nJoe Biden: (21:31)\nWell, look, the idea that I’m going to say, which I would never do, if an unaccompanied child ends up at the border, we’re just going to let them starve to death and stay on the other side, no previous administrations did either, except Trump. I’m not going to do it. I’m not going to do it. That’s why I’ve asked the Vice President of United States yesterday to be the lead person on dealing with focusing on the fundamental reasons why people leave Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador in the first place. It’s because of earthquakes, floods. It’s because of lack of food. It’s because of gang violence. It’s because of a whole range of things, that when I was Vice President, had the same obligation to deal with unaccompanied children. I was able to get it slowed up significantly by working with the heads of state of those communities, to do things like, in one of the major cities, the reason people were leaving as they couldn’t walk to the street because their kids were getting beat up or shot or in gang violence.\nJoe Biden: (22:44)\nWell, what I was able to do is not give money to the head of state, because so many are corrupt, but I was able to say, “Okay, you need lighting in the streets to change things? I’ll put the lighting in.” We got a contractor. We got the type of lighting. We paid directly to the contractor, did not go through the government. And violent crime significantly was reduced in that city. Fewer people sought to leave. When this hurricane occurred, the two hurricanes, instead of us going down and helping in a major way so that people would not have a reason to want to leave in the first place because they didn’t have housing or water or sustenance, we did nothing.\nJoe Biden: (23:25)\nWe’re going to do a lot in our administration. We’re going to be spending that 700 plus million dollars a year to change the life and circumstances of why people leave in the first place. That mother did not sit around on the kitchen table and say, “I got a great idea. The way I’m going to make sure my son gets taken care of is I’m going to put a…” How was he or she?\nYamiche: (23:51)\nHe’s nine. I also met a ten year old.\nJoe Biden: (23:54)\n“A nine year old. I’m going to send him on a thousand mile journey across the desert and up to the United States, because I know Joe Biden’s a nice guy and he’ll take care of him.” What a desperate act to have to take. The circumstances must be horrible. So we can do something about that. That’s what the Vice President’s going to be doing, what I did when President Obama asked me to come and deal. I was in Turkey at the time. He said, “You got to come home and take care of this.” So we put together a plan and it had an impact. And so the question here is whether, how we go ahead and do this, what we do. There’s no easy answer.\nYamiche: (24:37)\nA quick follow, if I may. Do you want to see these unaccompanied minors staying in this country? Or should they be deported eventually?\nJoe Biden: (24:50)\nWell, the judgment has to be made whether or not, and in this young man’s case, he has a mom. There’s an overwhelming reason why he’d be put in a plane and flown back to his mom.\nYamiche: (25:04)\nFinal follow, sir. You mentioned circumstances that must be horrific. The customs and border protection facility in Donna, Texas, I was there, is that 1,556% capacity right now with mostly unaccompanied minors. There are kids that are sleeping on floors. They are packed into these pods. I’ve spoken to lawyers who say that some of these children have not seen the sun in days. What is your reaction to these images that have come out from that particular facility? Is what’s happening inside acceptable to you? And when is this going to be fixed?\nJoe Biden: (25:40)\nThat’s a serious question, right? Is that acceptable to me? Come on. That’s why we’re going to be moving 1,000 of those kids out quickly. That’s why I got Fort Bliss opened up. That’s why I’ve been working from the moment this started to happen to try to find additional access for children to be able to safely, not just children, but particularly children, to be able to safely be housed while we follow through on the rest of what’s happening. That is totally unacceptable. Ken.\nZeke: (26:13)\nThank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you about Afghanistan. You face a May 1st deadline for the withdrawal of us troops from that country. As a candidate in foreign affairs, you wrote that it is past time to end these forever wars. Can you commit to the American people that by May 2nd, the US will no longer have forces in Afghanistan?\nJoe Biden: (26:46)\nThe answer is that it’s going to be hard to meet the May one deadline, just in terms of tactical reasons. It’s hard to get those troops out. So what we’ve been doing, what I’ve been doing, and what Secretary Blinken has been doing has been, we’ve been meeting with our allies, those other nations that have NATO allies who have troops in Afghanistan as well. And if we leave, we’re going to do so in a safe and orderly way. We’re in consultation, I say, with our allies and partners and how to proceed, and Secretary Blinken is meeting in Brussels this week with our NATO allies, particularly those who have forces there. And General Austin just met with Kayani and I’m waiting for the briefing on that. He is the leader, quote, in Afghanistan and Kabul.\nJoe Biden: (27:44)\nAnd there’s a UN led process that’s beginning shortly on how to mechanically get people… How to end this war. But it is not my intention to stay there for a long time. But the question is how, and in what circumstances do we meet that agreement that was made by President Trump to leave under a deal that looks like it’s not being able to be worked out to begin with? How’s that done? But we are not staying a long time.\nZeke: (28:20)\nYou just said, “If we leave.” Do you think it’s possible that we-\nJoe Biden: (28:23)\nWe will leave. The question is when we leave.\nZeke: (28:27)\nSorry. Do you believe though, it’s possible we could have troops there next year?\nJoe Biden: (28:33)\nI can’t picture that being the case. Okay. Kristen.\nKristen: (28:45)\nThank you very much, Mr. President. Given the conditions that were just laid out at the migrant facilities at the US border, will you commit to allowing journalists to have access to the facilities that are overcrowded moving forward?\nJoe Biden: (29:03)\nI will commit when my plan very shortly is underway to let you have access to not just them, but to other facilities as well.\nKristen: (29:12)\nHow soon will journalists be able to have access to the facilities? We’ve obviously been allowed to be inside one, but we haven’t seen the facilities in which children are packed together to really give the American people a chance to see that. Will you commit to transparency on this issue?\nJoe Biden: (29:30)\nI will commit to transparency, as soon as I am in a position to be able to implement what we’re doing right now. One of the reasons I haven’t gone down, my chief folks have gone down, is I don’t want it to become the issue. I don’t want to be bringing all the Secret Service and everybody with me to get in the way. So this has being set up and you’ll have full access to everything once we get this thing moving.\nKristen: (29:59)\nOkay. And just to be clear, how soon will that be Mr. President?\nJoe Biden: (30:02)\nI don’t know, to be clear.\nKristen: (30:07)\n[inaudible 00:30:07] responsibility for everything that’s happening at the border now. I hear you talking a lot about the past administration. You decided to roll back some of those policies. Did you move too quickly to roll back-\nJoe Biden: (30:17)\nTo roll back what, I’m sorry?\nKristen: (30:19)\nDid you move too quickly to roll back some of the executive orders of your predecessor?\nJoe Biden: (30:25)\nFirst of all, all the policies that were underway were not helping at all, did not slow up the amount of immigration, and as many people coming. And rolling back the policies of separating children from their mothers? I make no apology for that. Rolling back the policies have remaining in Mexico, sitting on the edge of the Rio Grande in a muddy circumstance with not enough to eat? I make no apologies for that. I make no apologies for ending programs that did not exist before Trump became president that have an incredibly negative impact on the law, international law, as well as on human dignity. And so I make no apologies for that.\nKristen: (31:12)\n[inaudible 00:31:12] ask you about foreign policy, Mr. President. Overnight, we learned that North Korea tested two ballistic missiles. What, if any, actions will you take? And what is your red line on North Korea?\nJoe Biden: (31:29)\nLet me say that number one, UN Resolution 1718 was violated by those particular missiles that were tested, number one. We’re consoling with our allies and partners. And there will be responses if they choose to escalate. We will respond accordingly. But I’m also prepared for some form of diplomacy, but it has to be-\nJoe Biden: (32:03)\nForm of diplomacy, but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearization. So that’s what we’re doing right now, consulting with our allies.\nKristen: (32:15)\nAnd just a very quick follow-up-\nJoe Biden: (32:16)\nYou only got another hour now, okay?\nKristen: (32:18)\nDiplomacy, can you define what you mean? And former President Obama warned the incoming President trump that North Korea was the top foreign policy issue that he was watching. Is that how you assess the crisis in North Korea?\nJoe Biden: (32:33)\nYes. Okay. Hang on a second here. Nancy, CBS?\nYamiche: (32:45)\nThank you very much, Mr. President. I want to go back to voting rights. And as Yamiche mentioned, Republican legislatures across the country are working to pass bills that would restrict voting, particularly, Democrats fear, impacting minority voters and young voters, the very people who helped to get you elected in November. Are you worried that if you don’t manage to pass voting rights legislation, that your party is going to lose seats and possibly lose control of the House and the Senate in 2022?\nJoe Biden: (33:19)\nWhat I’m worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It’s sick. It’s sick. Deciding in some states that you cannot bring water to people standing in line waiting to vote, deciding that you’re going to end voting at five o’clock when working people are just getting off work, deciding that there will be no absentee ballots under the most rigid circumstances, it’s all designed, and I’m going to spend my time doing three things. One, trying to figure out how to pass the legislation passed by the House, number one, number two, educating the American public.\nJoe Biden: (34:06)\nThe Republican voters I know find this despicable, Republican voters, the folks outside this White House. I’m not talking about the elected officials. I’m talking about voters. Voters. And so I’m convinced that we’ll be able to stop this because it is the most pernicious thing. This makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle. I mean, this is gigantic what they’re trying to do and it cannot be sustained. I’m going to do everything in my power, along with my friends in the House and the Senate, to keep that from becoming the law.\nYamiche: (34:49)\nIs there anything else you can do about it besides passing legislation?\nJoe Biden: (34:53)\nThe answer is yes, but I’m not going to lay out a strategy in front of the whole world and you now.\nYamiche: (35:00)\nThen, on a related note, have you decided whether you are going to run for reelection in 2024? You haven’t set up a reelection campaign yet as your predecessor had by this time.\nJoe Biden: (35:09)\nMy predecessor needed to. My predecessor, oh God, I miss him. No, the answer is yes, my plan is to run for reelection. That’s my expectation.\nYamiche: (35:20)\nAnd on one other note, on bipartisanship, your old friend, Mitch McConnell, says you have only spoken to each other once since you took office and that you have moved far left since taking office. Do you see it the same way he does? Have you rejected bipartisanship?\nJoe Biden: (35:39)\nNo, I haven’t at all. I’ve been meeting… When’s the last time a president invited the opposite party down at least a half a dozen times to talk about issues, everything from how we work? We’re working with a group of 20 members of the Senate right now and House on how we reestablish our ability to make computer chips and how we get ahead of the game, how we can work together. And we’re working together on a bunch of things.\nJoe Biden: (36:04)\nBut look, I know Mitch well, Mitch knows me well. I would expect Ms to say exactly what he said, but this is a matter of making sure that I would like Republican, elected Republican support, but what I know I have now is I have electoral support from Republican voters. Republican voters agree with what I’m doing. And so unless Mitch says the last thing I did, this last piece of legislation is so far left, well, then you ought to take a look at his party. Over 50% of them must be over that edge as well because they support what I did.\nJoe Biden: (36:47)\nOkay. Where am I here? Let me see. Caitlin?\nCaitlin: (36:55)\nThank you very much, Mr. President. I have a question for you, but first I’d like to follow up on a question from Yamiche, and that’s on the filibuster.\nJoe Biden: (37:02)\nThat counts as a question, but go ahead.\nCaitlin: (37:04)\nOkay. I’ll make it quick. It’s a good question.\nJoe Biden: (37:08)\nNo, no you can.\nCaitlin: (37:08)\nRegarding the filibuster, at John Lewis’ funeral, President Barack Obama said he believed the filibuster was a relic of the Jim Crow era. Do you agree?\nJoe Biden: (37:17)\nYes.\nCaitlin: (37:18)\nAnd if not, why not abolish it if it’s a Relic of the Jim Crow era?\nJoe Biden: (37:28)\nSuccessful electoral politics is the art of the possible. Let’s figure out how we can get this done and move in the direction of significantly changing the abuse of even the filibuster rule first. It’s been abused from the time it came into being by an extreme way in the last 20 years. Let’s deal with the abuse first.\nCaitlin: (37:54)\nIt sounds like you’re moving to eliminating the filibuster. Is that correct?\nJoe Biden: (38:01)\nI answered your question.\nCaitlin: (38:03)\nYou also just made some news by saying that you are going to run for reelection.\nJoe Biden: (38:08)\nI said that is my expectation.\nCaitlin: (38:09)\nSo is that a yes, that you are running for reelection?\nJoe Biden: (38:12)\nLook, I don’t know where you guys come from, man. I’ve never been able to travel. I’m a great respecter of fate. I’ve never been able to plan four and a half, three and a half years ahead for certain.\nCaitlin: (38:21)\nAnd if you do run, will Vice President Harris be on your ticket?\nJoe Biden: (38:26)\nI would fully expect that to be the case. She’s doing a great job. She’s a great partner. She’s a great partner.\nCaitlin: (38:32)\nAnd do you believe you’ll be running against former President Trump?\nJoe Biden: (38:35)\nOh, come on. I don’t even think about it. I have no idea. I have no idea whether there’ll be Republican party. Do you? I know you don’t have to answer my question, but I mean, you know, do you?\nJoe Biden: (38:47)\nI mean, look, the way I view things, I’ve become a great respecter fate in my life. I set a goal that’s in front of me to get things done for the people I care most about, which are hard-working decent American people really having it stuck to them. I want to change the paradigm. I want to change the paradigm where we start to reward work, not just wealth. I want to change the paradigm.\nJoe Biden: (39:14)\nIf you notice, didn’t you find it kind of interesting that my Republican friends were worried about the cost and the taxes that had to be had, if there is any tax to be had as they talk about it, in dealing with the act that we just passed which puts money in people’s pockets, ordinary people, to hear them complain when they passed a close to $2 trillion Trump tax cut, 83% going to the top 1%. Do you hear them talk about that at all?\nJoe Biden: (39:47)\nI love the fact that they found this whole idea of concern about the federal budget, it’s kind of amazing. When the federal budget is saving people’s lives, they don’t think it’s such a good idea. When the federal budget is feathering the nest of the wealthiest Americans, 90 of the Fortune 500 companies making billions of dollars, not paying a cent in taxes, reducing taxes to the point that people who are making, you know, if you’re a husband and wife, a school teacher and a cop, you’re paying at a higher rate than the average person making a billion dollars a year is. Something’s wrong. There are new found concern. I’m concerned.\nJoe Biden: (40:35)\nLook, I meant what I said when I ran, and a lot of you still think I’m wrong and I respect that. I said I’m running for three reasons, to restore the soul, dignity, honor, honesty, transparency to the American political system, two, to rebuild the backbone of this country. The middle-class, hard-working people and people struggling to get in to the middle class, they built America and unions built them. The third reason I said I was running was to unite the country. And generically speaking, all of you said no, you can’t do that. Well, I’ve not been able to unite the Congress, but I’ve been united in the country, based on the polling data. We have to come together. We have to.\nJoe Biden: (41:26)\nSo from my perspective, to me, it’s about just getting out there, putting one foot in front of the other and just trying to make things better for people, just hard-working people, people who get up every morning and just want to figure out how to put food on the table for their kids, to be able to have a little bit of breathing room, being able to make sure that they go to bed not staring to see like my dad did wondering whether, since he didn’t have health insurance, what happens if mom gets sick or he got sick. These are basic things, basic things. And I’m of the view that the vast majority of people, including registered Republicans by and large share that same view, that same sense of what’s appropriate.\nJoe Biden: (42:18)\nJustin, Justin [inaudible 00:42:24], Bloomberg.\nJustin: (42:26)\nThanks, Mr. President, I wanted to ask about your relationship with China now that you’ve been in office for a couple of months. There’s obviously the meeting in Alaska that was a little theatrical and there’s the continued human rights [inaudible 00:42:39]. So today I’m wondering are you more likely than you were when you came into office to maintain tariffs on China? Are you considering banning imports of forced labor products? And would you consider cutting off US investment or Chinese access to international payment systems?\nJoe Biden: (42:58)\nWell, look, they’re each specifically legitimate questions, but they only touch a smidgen of what the relationship with China really is about. I’ve known Xi Jinping for a long time. Allegedly by the time I left office as Vice President, I had spent more time with Xi Jinping than any world leader had because President Obama and the Chinese President Hu decided we should get to know one another since it was inappropriate for the president of United States to spend time with the vice president of another country, but it was obvious he was going to become the new leader of China.\nJoe Biden: (43:46)\nSo I spent hours upon hours with him alone with an interpreter, my interpreter and his, going into great detail. [inaudible 00:43:56] very, very straightforward. He doesn’t have a democratic with a small D bone in his body, but he’s a smart, smart guy. He’s one of the guys like Putin who thinks that autocracy is the wave of the future and democracy can’t function in an ever complex world.\nJoe Biden: (44:17)\nSo when I was elected and he called to congratulate me, I think to the surprise of the China experts who were his people on the call as well as mine listening, we had a two hour conversation for two hours, and we made several things clear to one another. I made it clear to him again what I’ve told them in person on several occasions, that we’re not looking for confrontation, although we know there will be steep, steep competition. Two, that we’ll have strong competition, but we’ll insist the China play by the international rules, fair competition, fair practices, fair trade.\nJoe Biden: (45:07)\nThirdly, in order to compete effectively, I indicated that we’re going to deal with China effectively, and we’re going to need three things to do that [inaudible 00:45:20] our people. First, we’re going to invest in American workers and American science. I said that all through the campaign, I say it again, and I’m setting up my administration to be able to do that, which is that back in the ’60s, we used to invest a little over 2% of our entire GDP in pure research and investment in science. Today it’s 0.7%. I’m going to change that. We’re going to change that.\nJoe Biden: (45:49)\nThe future lies in who can in fact own the future as it relates to technology, quantum computing, a whole range of things, including the medical fields. And so what I’m going to do is make sure we invest closer to 2%. One of the reasons why I’ve set up the [inaudible 00:46:12], the president’s board was scientists and the like, again, is we’re going to invest in medical research, cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, industries of the future, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotech, and we’re going to make real investments. China is out-investing us by a long shot because their plan is to own that future.\nJoe Biden: (46:39)\nThe second thing we’re going to do is we’re going to reestablish our alliances. And I’ve been very clear with him. It’s not anti-Chinese. And we’ve talked about it. I want to make sure that, for example, later today, after this, and a matter of fact, shortly after this, which is fine, we’ve been going close to an hour, I’m happy to go longer, but one of the things that I’m going to be doing, I’m going to be speaking with 27 heads of state in Europe, and very shortly, I think within the next hour or so, I don’t know the exact time.\nJoe Biden: (47:12)\nAnd earlier this month, and apparently it got the Chinese attention, that’s not why I did it, I met with our allies and how are we going to hold China accountable in the region, Australia, India, Japan, and the United States, the so-called quad, because we have to have democracies working together. Before too long, I’m going to have, I’m going to invite an alliance of democracies to come here to discuss the future. And so we’re going to make it clear that in order to deal with these things, we are going to hold China accountable to follow the rules, to follow the rules whether it relates to the South China Sea or the North China Sea or the agreement-\nJoe Biden: (48:03)\nThe South China Sea, or the North China Sea, or their agreement made on Taiwan or a whole range of other things. And the third thing, and the thing that I admire about dealing with Xi is he understands, he makes no pretense about not understanding what I’m saying anymore I knew him. I pointed out to him, “No leader can be sustained in his position or her position unless they represent the values of the country.” And I said, ” Mr. President, as I’ve told you before, Americans value the notion of freedom, America values human rights. We don’t always live up to our expectations, but there’s a value system. We are founded on that principle. And as long as you and your country continues to so blatantly violate human rights, we are going to continue in an unrelenting way to call it to the attention of the world and make it clear, make it clear what’s happening.”\nJoe Biden: (49:03)\nAnd he understood that. I made it clear that no American president, at least one did, but no American president had ever backed down from speaking out of what’s happening in the Uyghurs, what’s happening in Hong Kong. What’s happening in-country. That’s who we are. The moment a president walks away from that as the last one did, is the moment we began to lose all legitimacy around the world. It’s who we are. So I see stiff competition with China. China has an overall goal, and I don’t criticize them for the goal, but they have an overall goal to become the leading country in the world, the wealthiest country in the world and the most powerful country in the world. That’s not going to happen on my watch because United States is going to continue to grow and expand.\nJustin: (50:00)\nAll right, just to follow up on the meeting of democracy, is that where you expect in a multilateral way to make these decisions about sanctions or?\nJoe Biden: (50:11)\nNo, that’s not going to make the decision. That’s where I make sure we’re all on the same page. All on the same page. Look, I predict to you, your children or grandchildren are going to be doing their doctoral thesis on the issue of who succeeded autocracy or democracy, because that is what is at stake, not just with China, look around the world. We’re in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution of enormous consequence. Will there be middle class? How will people adjust to these significant changes in science and technology? The environment? How will they do that? And our democracy is equipped because all the people get to speak, to compete. It is clear, absolutely clear. And most of the scholars I dealt with at Penn agree with me around the country, that this is a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21st century and autocracies. If you notice, you don’t have Russia talking about communism anymore, it’s about an autocracy. Demand decisions made by a leader of a country. That’s what’s at stake here. We’ve got to prove democracy works.\nJustin: (51:40)\nMr. President, sorry. I know you haven’t had a chance to address the tragedies in Georgia and Colorado. You had said to stay tuned for actions that you might take on gun control. Wondering if you’ve made a decision either about sending the Manufacturer Liability Bill that you had promised on day one to Capitol Hill or executive actions like going after ghost guns or giving money to cities and states to battle gun control.\nJoe Biden: (52:08)\nAll the above. It’s a matter of timing. As you’ve all observed, successful presidents, better than me, have been successful in large part because they know how to time what they’re doing. Order it, decide and priorities, what needs to be done. The next major initiative is, and I’ll be announcing it Friday in Pittsburgh in detail, is to rebuild the infrastructure, both physical and technological infrastructure of this country so that we can compete and create significant numbers of really good paying jobs. Really good paying jobs. And some of you have been around long enough to know that used to be a great Republican goal initiative.\nJoe Biden: (53:15)\nI still think the majority of the American people don’t like the fact that we are now ranked what, 85th in the world in infrastructure. I mean, look, the future rests on whether or not we have the best airports that are going to accommodate air travel. Ports that you can get in and out of quickly. So businesses decide. Some of you if you were ever local reporters and you find your governor or mayor trying to attract business to your community. What’s the first thing that business asked? What’s the closest access to an interstate highway? How far am I from a freight rail? Is there water? Is there water available? Is there enough water available for me to conduct my business? All the things that relate to infrastructure. We have somewhere, I asked the staff to write it down for me and they did. Not for this, but for a longer discussion.\nJoe Biden: (54:12)\nWe have somewhere in terms of infrastructure, we rank 13th globally in infrastructure. China is investing three times more in infrastructure than the United States is. Bridges more than one-third of our bridges, 231,000 of them need repairs. Some are physical safety risks, or preservation work. One in five miles of our highways and major roads are in poor condition. That’s 186,000 miles of highway. Aviation, 20% of all flights, 20% of all flights weren’t on time resulting in 1.5 million hours lost in production. Six to 10 million homes in America still have lead pipes servicing their water lines. We have over a hundred thousand wellheads that are not kept, leaking methane.\nJoe Biden: (55:17)\nWhat are we doing? And by the way, we can put as many pipe fitters and miners on us to work, capping those wells at the same price that they were charged to dig those wells. So I just find it frustrating, frustrating and talk about. Last year point I’ll make in the infrastructure and I apologize for spending more time on it, but is that if you think about it, it’s the place where we will be able to see significantly increase American productivity. At the same time, providing really good jobs for people. But we can’t build back to what they used to be. We have to build the environments are… Global warming has already done significant damage. The roads that used to be above the water level, didn’t have to worry about where the drainage dish was. Now you got to rebuild them three feet higher because it’s not going to go back to what it was before, only get worse unless we stop it.\nJoe Biden: (56:45)\nThere’s so much we can do. Look at all the schools in America. Most of you live in the Washington area now, but in your hometowns, I don’t know where you’re all from. How many schools where the kids can’t drink the water out of the fountain? How many schools are still in a position where there’s asbestos? How many schools in America we’re sending our kids to don’t have adequate ventilation? How many schools, buildings, office complexes are wasting billions of barrels of oil over time because they can’t hold in the heat or the air conditioning because there’s leaks through the windows that are so porous and the connections. It’s amazing. So there’s so much we can do that’s good stuff. Makes people healthier and creates good jobs. And I think that I got one more question here. And Janet from Univision.\nYamiche: (57:55)\nThank you, Mr. President. We do have to be reporting at the border. And just like to Celia, we run into a pair of siblings who came in on Monday, were detained by CBP, had the phone number for their mother who lives in the U.S. We have contacted the mother. That’s the only way they know her kids are here because CBP today, Thursday has not contacted that mother. So when can we expect your promise of things getting better with contacting and experiencing-\nJoe Biden: (58:19)\nWell, they’re already getting better, but they’re going to get real, I got a whole hell of a lot better real quicker. We’re going to hear some people leaving. Okay. We can get this done. We’re going to get it done. I had a long meeting with the entire team and several cabinet level officers the other night. We’re going to be moving within the next week, over a hundred thousand, I mean a thousand people out of the border patrol into safe, secure beds and facilities. We’re going to significantly ramp up, we’re already out there contacting everyone from getting some of the employees at HHS. And there’s a lot of them doing other things and move them into making those calls. We’re in the process of rearranging and providing for the personnel needed to get that done. But I admire the fact that you were down there.\nJoe Biden: (59:15)\nYou’re making the calls yourself. It’s real. The next thing that has to happen though, as you well know, has to happen, there have to be some certitude that this is the actually mom, dad, or whomever. And there’s ways to do that. There’s ways to do that a little bit like determining whether or not you got the right code for your credit card. What was your dog’s name kind of thing. I’m being a bit facetious, but not really. And also seeking harder data from DNA to birth certificates, which takes longer. So I want to do this as quickly, as humanly possible and as safely as possible.\nYamiche: (59:56)\nAs we all know, treating the root causes in Latin America doesn’t change things overnight. How do you realistically and physically keep these families from coming to the U.S when things will not get better in their countries right away?\nJoe Biden: (01:00:11)\nWell, I can’t guarantee that but I know that all thing, the journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step. You know as well as I do, you cover it. You have serious… It’s not like somebody sitting on a Hanuman table in Guatemala, I mean somewhere in Mexico or in Guadalupe said, “I got a great idea. Let’s sell everything we have, give it to a coyote. Have them take our kids across the border into a desert where they don’t speak the language. Won’t that be fun? Let’s go.” That’s not how it happens. People don’t want to leave. When my great grandfather got in a coffin ship in the Irish Sea expectation was was he going to live long enough on that ship to get to the United States of America. But they left because of what the Brits had been doing. They were in real, real trouble.\nJoe Biden: (01:01:10)\nThey didn’t want to leave, but they had no choice. So we can’t, I can’t guarantee we’re going to solve everything, but I can guarantee we can make everything better. We can make it better. We can change the lives of so many people. And the other thing I want to point out to you, and I hope you point out, I realize it’s much more heart-wrenching and it is to deal with a five and six and seven year old, but you went down there and you saw the vast majority of these children. 70% are 16 years old, 17 years old and mostly males. That make it good or bad or different. But the idea that we have tens of thousands of kids in these God off of facilities that are really little babies crying all night, there’s some, that’s true. That’s why we got to act.\nJoe Biden: (01:02:01)\nAnd yesterday I asked my team both the director of the two agencies, as well as others. I asked them what would they in fact, and I asked their opinion because they’re the experts. But I said, “Focus on the most vulnerable immediately.” But there’s no reason why in the next month, as people crossed the border, that phone call can’t be made in the first 48 hours and began.\nYamiche: (01:02:26)\nIf I may I ask one last question, have you had any talks with Senate Republicans who are threatening this administration with not considering the immigration legislation that was passed in the house until the situation at the border has been resolved?\nJoe Biden: (01:02:41)\nNo, because I know they have to posture for a while.

Thank you. Thank you. Good afternoon. Before I take questions, I want to give you a progress report to the nation on where we stand 65 days into office here on vaccinations and a few other top priorities for the American people. First on vaccinations. On December 8th, I indicated that I hoped to get 100 million shots in people’s arms in my first 100 days. We met that goal last week by day 58, 42 days ahead of schedule. Now, today I’m setting a second goal and that is, we will, by my 100th day in office, have administered 200 million shots in people’s arms. That’s right, 200 million shots in 100 days. I know it’s ambitious, twice our original goal, but no other country in the world has even come close, not even close to what we are doing. And I believe we can do it.\nJoe Biden: (02:05)\nAnd today, we made a historic investment in reaching the hardest hit and the most vulnerable communities, the highest risk communities as a consequence of the virus by investing an additional $10 billion in being able to reach them. I also set a goal before I took office of getting a majority of schools in K through Eight fully open in the first 100 days. Now, thanks to the enormous amount of work done by our administration, educators, parents, local, state education officials and leaders, a recent Department of Education survey shows that nearly half of the K through Eight schools are open now full-time, five days a week for in-person learning. Not yet a majority, but we’re really close, and I believe in the 35 days left to go, we’ll meet that goal as well. As, of yesterday, more than 100 million payments of $1,400 have gone into people’s bank accounts. That’s real money in people’s pockets, bringing relief instantly almost. And millions more will be getting their money very soon.\nJoe Biden: (03:24)\nOne final note, since we passed the American Rescue Plan, we’re starting to see new signs of hope in our economy. Since it was passed, a majority of economic forecasters have significantly increased their projections on the economic growth that’s going to take place this year. They’re now projecting it will exceed 6%, a 6% growth in GDP. And just this morning, we learned that the number of people filing for weekly unemployment insurance fell by nearly 100,000 persons. This is the first time in a year the number’s fallen below the pre-pandemic high. So there are still too many Americans out of work, too many families hurting, and they still have a lot of work to do. But I can say to you, the American people, help is here and hope is on the way. Now, I’ll be happy to take your questions. Zeke at the Associated Press.\nZeke: (04:43)\nThank you, Mr. President. You mentioned your progress on COVID-19. I’d like to ask you about some of the other issues facing your Presidency. One of the defining challenges you face in the coming months is how to deliver on your promise to Americans on issues like immigration reform, gun control, voting rights, climate change. All of those right now are facing stiff united opposition from Republicans on Capitol Hill. How far are you willing to go to achieve those promises that you made to the American people?\nJoe Biden: (05:12)\nWell, look, when I took office, I decided that it was a fairly basic simple proposition, and that is, I got elected to solve problems and the most urgent problem facing the American people I stated from the outset was COVID-19 and the economic dislocation for millions and millions of Americans. And so that’s why I put all my focus in the beginning, there were a lot of problems, but all my focus on dealing with those particular problems. And the other problems we’re talking about from immigration to guns and the other things you mentioned are longterm problems. They’ve been around a long time, and what we’re going to be able to do, God willing, is now began one at a time to focus on those as well, and whether it’s immigration or guns or a number of other problems that face the country.\nJoe Biden: (06:17)\nBut the fundamental problem is getting people some peace of mind so they can go to bed at night and not stare at the ceiling, wondering where they lost their health insurance, whether they’re going to lose some family member, whether they’re going to be in a position where they’re going to lose their home, because they can’t pay their mortgage, or the millions of people who are going to get thrown out of their homes because of the inability to pay the rent. So we’re going to move on these one at a time, try to do as many simultaneously as we can, but that’s the reason why I focused as I have. And here’s the deal, I think my Republican colleagues are going to have to determine whether or not we want to work together or they decide that the way in which they want to proceed is to just decide to divide the country, continue the politics of division. But I’m not going to do that. I’m just going to move forward and take these things as they come.\nZeke: (07:24)\nA follow-up, Mr. President. Can your presidency be a success if you can’t make progress on those four challenges, climate change, immigration reform, gun control, voting rights?\nJoe Biden: (07:34)\nWell, I plan on making progress on all of them, but that’s going to be for the American people to decide. I doubt whether maybe you did, maybe others did. I thought many of you thought there was no possibility of my getting the plan I got passed, passed without any Republican votes. Pretty big deal. Got passed. Growing economy. People’s lives are changing. So let’s see what happens. All I know, I’ve been hired to solve problems, to solve problems, not create division. Okay. How about, Yamiche?\nYamiche: (08:17)\nThanks so much, Mr. President. You’ve said over and over again that immigrants shouldn’t come to this country right now. This isn’t the time to come. That message is not being received. Instead, the perception of you that got you elected as a moral decent man is the reason why a lot of immigrants are coming to this country and entrusting you with unaccompanied minors. How do you resolve that tension and how are you choosing which families can stay and which can go given the fact that even though with Title 42 there are some families that are staying? And is there a timeline for when we won’t be seeing these overcrowded facilities run by CPB when it comes to unaccompanied minors?\nJoe Biden: (08:55)\nWell, look, I guess I should be flattered people are coming because I’m the nice guy. That’s the reason why it’s happening, that I’m a decent man or however it’s phrased, that that’s why they’re coming, because they know Biden’s a good guy. Truth of the matter is, nothing has changed. As many people came, a 28% increase in children to the border in my administration, 31% in the last year, in 2019, before the pandemic in the Trump administration. It happens every single solitary year. There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March. It happens every year. In addition to that, there is a …. And by the way, does anybody suggest that there was a 31% increase under Trump because he was a nice guy and he was doing good things at the border? That’s not the reason they’re coming.\nJoe Biden: (09:57)\nThe reason they’re coming is that it’s the time they can travel with the least likelihood of dying on the way because of the heat and the desert, number one. Number two, they’re coming because of the circumstances in country, in country. The way to deal with this problem, and I started to deal with it back when I was Vice President putting together a bipartisan plan of over $700 million to do the root causes of why people are leaving. What did Trump do? He eliminated that funding. He didn’t use it. He didn’t do it. And in addition to that, what he did, he dismantled all the elements that exist to deal with what had been a problem and has been continued to be a problem for a long time. He, in fact, shut down the number of beds available. He did not fund HHS to get people to get the children out of those Border Patrol facilities, where they should not be, and not supposed to be more than a few days, a little while.\nJoe Biden: (11:04)\nBut he dismantled all of that, and so what we’re doing now is attempting to rebuild the system that can accommodate what is happening today. And I’d like to think it’s because I’m a nice guy, but it’s not. It’s because of what’s happened every year. Let me say one other thing on this. If you take a look at the number of people are coming, the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of people coming to the border and crossing are being sent back, are being sent back. Thousands, tens of thousands of people who are over 18 years of age and single people, one at a time coming, have been sent back, sent home. We’re sending back the vast majority of the families that are coming. We’re trying to work out now with Mexico their willingness to take more of those families back. That’s what’s happening. They’re not getting across the border. And those who are coming across the border who are unaccompanied children, we’re moving rapidly to try to put in place what was dismantled, as I said.\nJoe Biden: (12:15)\nFor example, of all the children who are coming across the border, over 70% are either 16 or 17 years old. We’re not talking about people ripping babies from mothers arms or a little three-year old standing on the border, less than I think it’s one and a half percent fall in the category of the very young. So what we’re doing is we’re providing for the space again to be able to get these kids out of the border patrol facilities, which no child, no one should be in any longer than 72 hours. And today I went to, for example, I used all the resources available to me went to the Defense Department and the Secretary of Defense has just made available Fort Bliss, 5,000 beds. Be immediately available, 5,000 beds on the Texas border.\nJoe Biden: (13:08)\nSo we’re building back up the capacity that should have been maintained and built upon that Trump dismantled. It’s going to take time. And the other thing we’re doing, I might add, am I giving you too long an answer, because if you don’t want the detail. No, no, but I mean, I don’t know how much detail you want about immigration. Maybe I’ll stop there.\nYamiche: (13:32)\nMy follow-up question is, one, if you could talk a little bit about which families, why they’re being allowed to stay, what the families that are being allowed to stay, why they’re being allowed to stay. In addition to that, when it comes to the filibuster, which is what Zeke was asking about, immigration is a big issue, of course, related to the filibuster, but there’s also Republicans who are passing bill after bill trying to restrict voting rights. Chuck Schumer’s calling it in an existential threat to democracy. Why not back a filibuster rule that at least gets around issues, including voting rights or immigration? Jim Clyburn, someone, of course, who you know very well has backed the idea of a filibuster rule when it comes to civil rights and voting rights?\nJoe Biden: (14:16)\nWell, look, I’m going to deal with all of those problems. The question is, the priorities as they come and land on my plate. Let’s go to the first question you asked, the first of the second questions you’ve asked, and that is, what about dealing with families? Why are some not going back? Because Mexico is refusing to take them back. They’re saying they won’t take them back, not all of them. We’re in negotiations with the President of Mexico. I think we’re going to see that change. They should all be going back, all be going back. The only people we’re not going to let sitting there on the other side of the Rio Grande by themselves with no help are children. And what we’re doing there, and it’s important point to understand, I know you understand it, I don’t mean to say it that way, an important point to focus on, the vast majority of people under the age of 18 coming to the United States come with a telephone number on a wristband or come with a telephone number in their pocket in the United States.\nJoe Biden: (15:21)\nA mother, a father, a close relative, a grandma, or grandpa. What was happening before is it’s taking literally weeks and weeks and maybe even months before anybody’d pick up the phone and call to see if there really was someone there. Well, we’ve set up a system now where within 24 hours there’s a phone call made as that person, that child crosses the border. And then a verification system being put in place as of today to determine quickly whether or not that is a trafficker being called, or that is actually a mom, a dad and or a close relative. They’re establishing that right off the bat if it in fact is mom or-\nJoe Biden: (16:03)\nEstablishing that right off the bat. If it in fact is mom or dad. Dad says, to take the extreme case, “I got a birth certificate.”J Then guess what? We’re getting that kid directly to that parent immediately. And so that’s going to reduce significantly. There’s two ways to reduce child populations in circumstances that are not acceptable, like being held at a border patrol station. One is to get them to the place where they have a relative and set a date as to when the hearing can be held. The second way to do it is put them in a health and human services facility that we’re occupying now, both licensed beds around the country that exists, as well as, for example, federal resources like Fort Bliss, to get them safely in a place where they can be taken care of while they’re fate is determined.\nSpeaker 1: (17:02)\n[inaudible 00:17:02] filibuster.\nJoe Biden: (17:02)\nFilibuster. Filibuster. With regard to the filibuster, I believe we should go back to a position of the filibuster that existed just when I came to the United States Senate 120 years ago. And that is that it used to be required for the filibuster… And I had a card on this. I was going to give you the statistics, but you probably know them. That it used to be that from between 1917 and 1971, the filibuster existed, there were a total of 58 eight motions to break the filibuster, that whole time. Last year alone, there were five times that many. So it’s being abused in a gigantic way. And for example, it used to be, you had to stand there and talk and talk and talk and talk until you collapsed. And guess what? People got tired of talking and tired of collapsing. Filibusters broke down and were able to break the filibuster, get a [inaudible 00:18:05] vote.\nJoe Biden: (18:06)\nSo I strongly support moving in that direction, in addition to having an open mind about dealing with certain things that are just elemental to the functioning of our democracy, like the right to vote, like the basic right to vote. We’ve amended the filibuster in the past. But here’s the deal. As you observed, I’m a fairly practical guy. I want to get things done. I want to get them done consistent with what we promised the American people. And in order to do that in a 50 50 Senate, we’ve got to get to the place where I get 50 votes so that the Vice President of the United States can break the tie, or I get 51 votes without her.\nJoe Biden: (18:52)\nAnd so I’m going to say something outrageous. I’ve never been particularly poor at calculating how to get things done in the United States Senate. So the best way to get something done, if you hold near and dear to you that you like to be able to… Anyway, we’re ready to get a lot done. And if we have to, if there’s complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster, then we’ll have to go beyond what I’m talking about. Okay. Hang on. Sorry. Oh, [inaudible 00:19:36], Ms. Kim.\nMs. Kim: (19:36)\nThank you, Mr. President. To follow up on the filibuster, so do you believe it should take 60 votes to end a filibuster on legislation or 51?\nJoe Biden: (19:51)\nIf we can ed with 51, we would have no problem. You’re going to have to… The existing rule… It’s going to be hard to get a parliamentary ruling that allows 50 votes to end the filibuster, the existence of a filibuster. But it’s not my expertise on what the parliamentary rules on how to get there are. But our preoccupation with the filibuster is totally legitimate. But in the meantime, we got a lot we can do while we’re talking about what we’re going to do with about the filibuster. Let me get here. Okay. Cecilia Vega.\nYamiche: (20:38)\nI’d like to circle back to immigration, please. You just listed the reasons that people are coming, talking about in-country problems, saying that it happens every year. You blamed the last administration, sir. I just got back last night from a reporting trip to the border where I met nine-year-old Josevs who walked here from Honduras by himself along with another little boy. He had that phone number on him and we were able to call his family. His mother says that she sent her son to this country because she believes that you are not deporting unaccompanied minors like her son. That’s why she sent him alone from Honduras. So, sir, you blamed the last administration, but is your messaging and saying that these children are and will be allowed to stay in this country and work their way through this process, encouraging families like Josevs to come?\nJoe Biden: (21:31)\nWell, look, the idea that I’m going to say, which I would never do, if an unaccompanied child ends up at the border, we’re just going to let them starve to death and stay on the other side, no previous administrations did either, except Trump. I’m not going to do it. I’m not going to do it. That’s why I’ve asked the Vice President of United States yesterday to be the lead person on dealing with focusing on the fundamental reasons why people leave Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador in the first place. It’s because of earthquakes, floods. It’s because of lack of food. It’s because of gang violence. It’s because of a whole range of things, that when I was Vice President, had the same obligation to deal with unaccompanied children. I was able to get it slowed up significantly by working with the heads of state of those communities, to do things like, in one of the major cities, the reason people were leaving as they couldn’t walk to the street because their kids were getting beat up or shot or in gang violence.\nJoe Biden: (22:44)\nWell, what I was able to do is not give money to the head of state, because so many are corrupt, but I was able to say, “Okay, you need lighting in the streets to change things? I’ll put the lighting in.” We got a contractor. We got the type of lighting. We paid directly to the contractor, did not go through the government. And violent crime significantly was reduced in that city. Fewer people sought to leave. When this hurricane occurred, the two hurricanes, instead of us going down and helping in a major way so that people would not have a reason to want to leave in the first place because they didn’t have housing or water or sustenance, we did nothing.\nJoe Biden: (23:25)\nWe’re going to do a lot in our administration. We’re going to be spending that 700 plus million dollars a year to change the life and circumstances of why people leave in the first place. That mother did not sit around on the kitchen table and say, “I got a great idea. The way I’m going to make sure my son gets taken care of is I’m going to put a…” How was he or she?\nYamiche: (23:51)\nHe’s nine. I also met a ten year old.\nJoe Biden: (23:54)\n“A nine year old. I’m going to send him on a thousand mile journey across the desert and up to the United States, because I know Joe Biden’s a nice guy and he’ll take care of him.” What a desperate act to have to take. The circumstances must be horrible. So we can do something about that. That’s what the Vice President’s going to be doing, what I did when President Obama asked me to come and deal. I was in Turkey at the time. He said, “You got to come home and take care of this.” So we put together a plan and it had an impact. And so the question here is whether, how we go ahead and do this, what we do. There’s no easy answer.\nYamiche: (24:37)\nA quick follow, if I may. Do you want to see these unaccompanied minors staying in this country? Or should they be deported eventually?\nJoe Biden: (24:50)\nWell, the judgment has to be made whether or not, and in this young man’s case, he has a mom. There’s an overwhelming reason why he’d be put in a plane and flown back to his mom.\nYamiche: (25:04)\nFinal follow, sir. You mentioned circumstances that must be horrific. The customs and border protection facility in Donna, Texas, I was there, is that 1,556% capacity right now with mostly unaccompanied minors. There are kids that are sleeping on floors. They are packed into these pods. I’ve spoken to lawyers who say that some of these children have not seen the sun in days. What is your reaction to these images that have come out from that particular facility? Is what’s happening inside acceptable to you? And when is this going to be fixed?\nJoe Biden: (25:40)\nThat’s a serious question, right? Is that acceptable to me? Come on. That’s why we’re going to be moving 1,000 of those kids out quickly. That’s why I got Fort Bliss opened up. That’s why I’ve been working from the moment this started to happen to try to find additional access for children to be able to safely, not just children, but particularly children, to be able to safely be housed while we follow through on the rest of what’s happening. That is totally unacceptable. Ken.\nZeke: (26:13)\nThank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you about Afghanistan. You face a May 1st deadline for the withdrawal of us troops from that country. As a candidate in foreign affairs, you wrote that it is past time to end these forever wars. Can you commit to the American people that by May 2nd, the US will no longer have forces in Afghanistan?\nJoe Biden: (26:46)\nThe answer is that it’s going to be hard to meet the May one deadline, just in terms of tactical reasons. It’s hard to get those troops out. So what we’ve been doing, what I’ve been doing, and what Secretary Blinken has been doing has been, we’ve been meeting with our allies, those other nations that have NATO allies who have troops in Afghanistan as well. And if we leave, we’re going to do so in a safe and orderly way. We’re in consultation, I say, with our allies and partners and how to proceed, and Secretary Blinken is meeting in Brussels this week with our NATO allies, particularly those who have forces there. And General Austin just met with Kayani and I’m waiting for the briefing on that. He is the leader, quote, in Afghanistan and Kabul.\nJoe Biden: (27:44)\nAnd there’s a UN led process that’s beginning shortly on how to mechanically get people… How to end this war. But it is not my intention to stay there for a long time. But the question is how, and in what circumstances do we meet that agreement that was made by President Trump to leave under a deal that looks like it’s not being able to be worked out to begin with? How’s that done? But we are not staying a long time.\nZeke: (28:20)\nYou just said, “If we leave.” Do you think it’s possible that we-\nJoe Biden: (28:23)\nWe will leave. The question is when we leave.\nZeke: (28:27)\nSorry. Do you believe though, it’s possible we could have troops there next year?\nJoe Biden: (28:33)\nI can’t picture that being the case. Okay. Kristen.\nKristen: (28:45)\nThank you very much, Mr. President. Given the conditions that were just laid out at the migrant facilities at the US border, will you commit to allowing journalists to have access to the facilities that are overcrowded moving forward?\nJoe Biden: (29:03)\nI will commit when my plan very shortly is underway to let you have access to not just them, but to other facilities as well.\nKristen: (29:12)\nHow soon will journalists be able to have access to the facilities? We’ve obviously been allowed to be inside one, but we haven’t seen the facilities in which children are packed together to really give the American people a chance to see that. Will you commit to transparency on this issue?\nJoe Biden: (29:30)\nI will commit to transparency, as soon as I am in a position to be able to implement what we’re doing right now. One of the reasons I haven’t gone down, my chief folks have gone down, is I don’t want it to become the issue. I don’t want to be bringing all the Secret Service and everybody with me to get in the way. So this has being set up and you’ll have full access to everything once we get this thing moving.\nKristen: (29:59)\nOkay. And just to be clear, how soon will that be Mr. President?\nJoe Biden: (30:02)\nI don’t know, to be clear.\nKristen: (30:07)\n[inaudible 00:30:07] responsibility for everything that’s happening at the border now. I hear you talking a lot about the past administration. You decided to roll back some of those policies. Did you move too quickly to roll back-\nJoe Biden: (30:17)\nTo roll back what, I’m sorry?\nKristen: (30:19)\nDid you move too quickly to roll back some of the executive orders of your predecessor?\nJoe Biden: (30:25)\nFirst of all, all the policies that were underway were not helping at all, did not slow up the amount of immigration, and as many people coming. And rolling back the policies of separating children from their mothers? I make no apology for that. Rolling back the policies have remaining in Mexico, sitting on the edge of the Rio Grande in a muddy circumstance with not enough to eat? I make no apologies for that. I make no apologies for ending programs that did not exist before Trump became president that have an incredibly negative impact on the law, international law, as well as on human dignity. And so I make no apologies for that.\nKristen: (31:12)\n[inaudible 00:31:12] ask you about foreign policy, Mr. President. Overnight, we learned that North Korea tested two ballistic missiles. What, if any, actions will you take? And what is your red line on North Korea?\nJoe Biden: (31:29)\nLet me say that number one, UN Resolution 1718 was violated by those particular missiles that were tested, number one. We’re consoling with our allies and partners. And there will be responses if they choose to escalate. We will respond accordingly. But I’m also prepared for some form of diplomacy, but it has to be-\nJoe Biden: (32:03)\nForm of diplomacy, but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearization. So that’s what we’re doing right now, consulting with our allies.\nKristen: (32:15)\nAnd just a very quick follow-up-\nJoe Biden: (32:16)\nYou only got another hour now, okay?\nKristen: (32:18)\nDiplomacy, can you define what you mean? And former President Obama warned the incoming President trump that North Korea was the top foreign policy issue that he was watching. Is that how you assess the crisis in North Korea?\nJoe Biden: (32:33)\nYes. Okay. Hang on a second here. Nancy, CBS?\nYamiche: (32:45)\nThank you very much, Mr. President. I want to go back to voting rights. And as Yamiche mentioned, Republican legislatures across the country are working to pass bills that would restrict voting, particularly, Democrats fear, impacting minority voters and young voters, the very people who helped to get you elected in November. Are you worried that if you don’t manage to pass voting rights legislation, that your party is going to lose seats and possibly lose control of the House and the Senate in 2022?\nJoe Biden: (33:19)\nWhat I’m worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It’s sick. It’s sick. Deciding in some states that you cannot bring water to people standing in line waiting to vote, deciding that you’re going to end voting at five o’clock when working people are just getting off work, deciding that there will be no absentee ballots under the most rigid circumstances, it’s all designed, and I’m going to spend my time doing three things. One, trying to figure out how to pass the legislation passed by the House, number one, number two, educating the American public.\nJoe Biden: (34:06)\nThe Republican voters I know find this despicable, Republican voters, the folks outside this White House. I’m not talking about the elected officials. I’m talking about voters. Voters. And so I’m convinced that we’ll be able to stop this because it is the most pernicious thing. This makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle. I mean, this is gigantic what they’re trying to do and it cannot be sustained. I’m going to do everything in my power, along with my friends in the House and the Senate, to keep that from becoming the law.\nYamiche: (34:49)\nIs there anything else you can do about it besides passing legislation?\nJoe Biden: (34:53)\nThe answer is yes, but I’m not going to lay out a strategy in front of the whole world and you now.\nYamiche: (35:00)\nThen, on a related note, have you decided whether you are going to run for reelection in 2024? You haven’t set up a reelection campaign yet as your predecessor had by this time.\nJoe Biden: (35:09)\nMy predecessor needed to. My predecessor, oh God, I miss him. No, the answer is yes, my plan is to run for reelection. That’s my expectation.\nYamiche: (35:20)\nAnd on one other note, on bipartisanship, your old friend, Mitch McConnell, says you have only spoken to each other once since you took office and that you have moved far left since taking office. Do you see it the same way he does? Have you rejected bipartisanship?\nJoe Biden: (35:39)\nNo, I haven’t at all. I’ve been meeting… When’s the last time a president invited the opposite party down at least a half a dozen times to talk about issues, everything from how we work? We’re working with a group of 20 members of the Senate right now and House on how we reestablish our ability to make computer chips and how we get ahead of the game, how we can work together. And we’re working together on a bunch of things.\nJoe Biden: (36:04)\nBut look, I know Mitch well, Mitch knows me well. I would expect Ms to say exactly what he said, but this is a matter of making sure that I would like Republican, elected Republican support, but what I know I have now is I have electoral support from Republican voters. Republican voters agree with what I’m doing. And so unless Mitch says the last thing I did, this last piece of legislation is so far left, well, then you ought to take a look at his party. Over 50% of them must be over that edge as well because they support what I did.\nJoe Biden: (36:47)\nOkay. Where am I here? Let me see. Caitlin?\nCaitlin: (36:55)\nThank you very much, Mr. President. I have a question for you, but first I’d like to follow up on a question from Yamiche, and that’s on the filibuster.\nJoe Biden: (37:02)\nThat counts as a question, but go ahead.\nCaitlin: (37:04)\nOkay. I’ll make it quick. It’s a good question.\nJoe Biden: (37:08)\nNo, no you can.\nCaitlin: (37:08)\nRegarding the filibuster, at John Lewis’ funeral, President Barack Obama said he believed the filibuster was a relic of the Jim Crow era. Do you agree?\nJoe Biden: (37:17)\nYes.\nCaitlin: (37:18)\nAnd if not, why not abolish it if it’s a Relic of the Jim Crow era?\nJoe Biden: (37:28)\nSuccessful electoral politics is the art of the possible. Let’s figure out how we can get this done and move in the direction of significantly changing the abuse of even the filibuster rule first. It’s been abused from the time it came into being by an extreme way in the last 20 years. Let’s deal with the abuse first.\nCaitlin: (37:54)\nIt sounds like you’re moving to eliminating the filibuster. Is that correct?\nJoe Biden: (38:01)\nI answered your question.\nCaitlin: (38:03)\nYou also just made some news by saying that you are going to run for reelection.\nJoe Biden: (38:08)\nI said that is my expectation.\nCaitlin: (38:09)\nSo is that a yes, that you are running for reelection?\nJoe Biden: (38:12)\nLook, I don’t know where you guys come from, man. I’ve never been able to travel. I’m a great respecter of fate. I’ve never been able to plan four and a half, three and a half years ahead for certain.\nCaitlin: (38:21)\nAnd if you do run, will Vice President Harris be on your ticket?\nJoe Biden: (38:26)\nI would fully expect that to be the case. She’s doing a great job. She’s a great partner. She’s a great partner.\nCaitlin: (38:32)\nAnd do you believe you’ll be running against former President Trump?\nJoe Biden: (38:35)\nOh, come on. I don’t even think about it. I have no idea. I have no idea whether there’ll be Republican party. Do you? I know you don’t have to answer my question, but I mean, you know, do you?\nJoe Biden: (38:47)\nI mean, look, the way I view things, I’ve become a great respecter fate in my life. I set a goal that’s in front of me to get things done for the people I care most about, which are hard-working decent American people really having it stuck to them. I want to change the paradigm. I want to change the paradigm where we start to reward work, not just wealth. I want to change the paradigm.\nJoe Biden: (39:14)\nIf you notice, didn’t you find it kind of interesting that my Republican friends were worried about the cost and the taxes that had to be had, if there is any tax to be had as they talk about it, in dealing with the act that we just passed which puts money in people’s pockets, ordinary people, to hear them complain when they passed a close to $2 trillion Trump tax cut, 83% going to the top 1%. Do you hear them talk about that at all?\nJoe Biden: (39:47)\nI love the fact that they found this whole idea of concern about the federal budget, it’s kind of amazing. When the federal budget is saving people’s lives, they don’t think it’s such a good idea. When the federal budget is feathering the nest of the wealthiest Americans, 90 of the Fortune 500 companies making billions of dollars, not paying a cent in taxes, reducing taxes to the point that people who are making, you know, if you’re a husband and wife, a school teacher and a cop, you’re paying at a higher rate than the average person making a billion dollars a year is. Something’s wrong. There are new found concern. I’m concerned.\nJoe Biden: (40:35)\nLook, I meant what I said when I ran, and a lot of you still think I’m wrong and I respect that. I said I’m running for three reasons, to restore the soul, dignity, honor, honesty, transparency to the American political system, two, to rebuild the backbone of this country. The middle-class, hard-working people and people struggling to get in to the middle class, they built America and unions built them. The third reason I said I was running was to unite the country. And generically speaking, all of you said no, you can’t do that. Well, I’ve not been able to unite the Congress, but I’ve been united in the country, based on the polling data. We have to come together. We have to.\nJoe Biden: (41:26)\nSo from my perspective, to me, it’s about just getting out there, putting one foot in front of the other and just trying to make things better for people, just hard-working people, people who get up every morning and just want to figure out how to put food on the table for their kids, to be able to have a little bit of breathing room, being able to make sure that they go to bed not staring to see like my dad did wondering whether, since he didn’t have health insurance, what happens if mom gets sick or he got sick. These are basic things, basic things. And I’m of the view that the vast majority of people, including registered Republicans by and large share that same view, that same sense of what’s appropriate.\nJoe Biden: (42:18)\nJustin, Justin [inaudible 00:42:24], Bloomberg.\nJustin: (42:26)\nThanks, Mr. President, I wanted to ask about your relationship with China now that you’ve been in office for a couple of months. There’s obviously the meeting in Alaska that was a little theatrical and there’s the continued human rights [inaudible 00:42:39]. So today I’m wondering are you more likely than you were when you came into office to maintain tariffs on China? Are you considering banning imports of forced labor products? And would you consider cutting off US investment or Chinese access to international payment systems?\nJoe Biden: (42:58)\nWell, look, they’re each specifically legitimate questions, but they only touch a smidgen of what the relationship with China really is about. I’ve known Xi Jinping for a long time. Allegedly by the time I left office as Vice President, I had spent more time with Xi Jinping than any world leader had because President Obama and the Chinese President Hu decided we should get to know one another since it was inappropriate for the president of United States to spend time with the vice president of another country, but it was obvious he was going to become the new leader of China.\nJoe Biden: (43:46)\nSo I spent hours upon hours with him alone with an interpreter, my interpreter and his, going into great detail. [inaudible 00:43:56] very, very straightforward. He doesn’t have a democratic with a small D bone in his body, but he’s a smart, smart guy. He’s one of the guys like Putin who thinks that autocracy is the wave of the future and democracy can’t function in an ever complex world.\nJoe Biden: (44:17)\nSo when I was elected and he called to congratulate me, I think to the surprise of the China experts who were his people on the call as well as mine listening, we had a two hour conversation for two hours, and we made several things clear to one another. I made it clear to him again what I’ve told them in person on several occasions, that we’re not looking for confrontation, although we know there will be steep, steep competition. Two, that we’ll have strong competition, but we’ll insist the China play by the international rules, fair competition, fair practices, fair trade.\nJoe Biden: (45:07)\nThirdly, in order to compete effectively, I indicated that we’re going to deal with China effectively, and we’re going to need three things to do that [inaudible 00:45:20] our people. First, we’re going to invest in American workers and American science. I said that all through the campaign, I say it again, and I’m setting up my administration to be able to do that, which is that back in the ’60s, we used to invest a little over 2% of our entire GDP in pure research and investment in science. Today it’s 0.7%. I’m going to change that. We’re going to change that.\nJoe Biden: (45:49)\nThe future lies in who can in fact own the future as it relates to technology, quantum computing, a whole range of things, including the medical fields. And so what I’m going to do is make sure we invest closer to 2%. One of the reasons why I’ve set up the [inaudible 00:46:12], the president’s board was scientists and the like, again, is we’re going to invest in medical research, cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, industries of the future, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotech, and we’re going to make real investments. China is out-investing us by a long shot because their plan is to own that future.\nJoe Biden: (46:39)\nThe second thing we’re going to do is we’re going to reestablish our alliances. And I’ve been very clear with him. It’s not anti-Chinese. And we’ve talked about it. I want to make sure that, for example, later today, after this, and a matter of fact, shortly after this, which is fine, we’ve been going close to an hour, I’m happy to go longer, but one of the things that I’m going to be doing, I’m going to be speaking with 27 heads of state in Europe, and very shortly, I think within the next hour or so, I don’t know the exact time.\nJoe Biden: (47:12)\nAnd earlier this month, and apparently it got the Chinese attention, that’s not why I did it, I met with our allies and how are we going to hold China accountable in the region, Australia, India, Japan, and the United States, the so-called quad, because we have to have democracies working together. Before too long, I’m going to have, I’m going to invite an alliance of democracies to come here to discuss the future. And so we’re going to make it clear that in order to deal with these things, we are going to hold China accountable to follow the rules, to follow the rules whether it relates to the South China Sea or the North China Sea or the agreement-\nJoe Biden: (48:03)\nThe South China Sea, or the North China Sea, or their agreement made on Taiwan or a whole range of other things. And the third thing, and the thing that I admire about dealing with Xi is he understands, he makes no pretense about not understanding what I’m saying anymore I knew him. I pointed out to him, “No leader can be sustained in his position or her position unless they represent the values of the country.” And I said, ” Mr. President, as I’ve told you before, Americans value the notion of freedom, America values human rights. We don’t always live up to our expectations, but there’s a value system. We are founded on that principle. And as long as you and your country continues to so blatantly violate human rights, we are going to continue in an unrelenting way to call it to the attention of the world and make it clear, make it clear what’s happening.”\nJoe Biden: (49:03)\nAnd he understood that. I made it clear that no American president, at least one did, but no American president had ever backed down from speaking out of what’s happening in the Uyghurs, what’s happening in Hong Kong. What’s happening in-country. That’s who we are. The moment a president walks away from that as the last one did, is the moment we began to lose all legitimacy around the world. It’s who we are. So I see stiff competition with China. China has an overall goal, and I don’t criticize them for the goal, but they have an overall goal to become the leading country in the world, the wealthiest country in the world and the most powerful country in the world. That’s not going to happen on my watch because United States is going to continue to grow and expand.\nJustin: (50:00)\nAll right, just to follow up on the meeting of democracy, is that where you expect in a multilateral way to make these decisions about sanctions or?\nJoe Biden: (50:11)\nNo, that’s not going to make the decision. That’s where I make sure we’re all on the same page. All on the same page. Look, I predict to you, your children or grandchildren are going to be doing their doctoral thesis on the issue of who succeeded autocracy or democracy, because that is what is at stake, not just with China, look around the world. We’re in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution of enormous consequence. Will there be middle class? How will people adjust to these significant changes in science and technology? The environment? How will they do that? And our democracy is equipped because all the people get to speak, to compete. It is clear, absolutely clear. And most of the scholars I dealt with at Penn agree with me around the country, that this is a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21st century and autocracies. If you notice, you don’t have Russia talking about communism anymore, it’s about an autocracy. Demand decisions made by a leader of a country. That’s what’s at stake here. We’ve got to prove democracy works.\nJustin: (51:40)\nMr. President, sorry. I know you haven’t had a chance to address the tragedies in Georgia and Colorado. You had said to stay tuned for actions that you might take on gun control. Wondering if you’ve made a decision either about sending the Manufacturer Liability Bill that you had promised on day one to Capitol Hill or executive actions like going after ghost guns or giving money to cities and states to battle gun control.\nJoe Biden: (52:08)\nAll the above. It’s a matter of timing. As you’ve all observed, successful presidents, better than me, have been successful in large part because they know how to time what they’re doing. Order it, decide and priorities, what needs to be done. The next major initiative is, and I’ll be announcing it Friday in Pittsburgh in detail, is to rebuild the infrastructure, both physical and technological infrastructure of this country so that we can compete and create significant numbers of really good paying jobs. Really good paying jobs. And some of you have been around long enough to know that used to be a great Republican goal initiative.\nJoe Biden: (53:15)\nI still think the majority of the American people don’t like the fact that we are now ranked what, 85th in the world in infrastructure. I mean, look, the future rests on whether or not we have the best airports that are going to accommodate air travel. Ports that you can get in and out of quickly. So businesses decide. Some of you if you were ever local reporters and you find your governor or mayor trying to attract business to your community. What’s the first thing that business asked? What’s the closest access to an interstate highway? How far am I from a freight rail? Is there water? Is there water available? Is there enough water available for me to conduct my business? All the things that relate to infrastructure. We have somewhere, I asked the staff to write it down for me and they did. Not for this, but for a longer discussion.\nJoe Biden: (54:12)\nWe have somewhere in terms of infrastructure, we rank 13th globally in infrastructure. China is investing three times more in infrastructure than the United States is. Bridges more than one-third of our bridges, 231,000 of them need repairs. Some are physical safety risks, or preservation work. One in five miles of our highways and major roads are in poor condition. That’s 186,000 miles of highway. Aviation, 20% of all flights, 20% of all flights weren’t on time resulting in 1.5 million hours lost in production. Six to 10 million homes in America still have lead pipes servicing their water lines. We have over a hundred thousand wellheads that are not kept, leaking methane.\nJoe Biden: (55:17)\nWhat are we doing? And by the way, we can put as many pipe fitters and miners on us to work, capping those wells at the same price that they were charged to dig those wells. So I just find it frustrating, frustrating and talk about. Last year point I’ll make in the infrastructure and I apologize for spending more time on it, but is that if you think about it, it’s the place where we will be able to see significantly increase American productivity. At the same time, providing really good jobs for people. But we can’t build back to what they used to be. We have to build the environments are… Global warming has already done significant damage. The roads that used to be above the water level, didn’t have to worry about where the drainage dish was. Now you got to rebuild them three feet higher because it’s not going to go back to what it was before, only get worse unless we stop it.\nJoe Biden: (56:45)\nThere’s so much we can do. Look at all the schools in America. Most of you live in the Washington area now, but in your hometowns, I don’t know where you’re all from. How many schools where the kids can’t drink the water out of the fountain? How many schools are still in a position where there’s asbestos? How many schools in America we’re sending our kids to don’t have adequate ventilation? How many schools, buildings, office complexes are wasting billions of barrels of oil over time because they can’t hold in the heat or the air conditioning because there’s leaks through the windows that are so porous and the connections. It’s amazing. So there’s so much we can do that’s good stuff. Makes people healthier and creates good jobs. And I think that I got one more question here. And Janet from Univision.\nYamiche: (57:55)\nThank you, Mr. President. We do have to be reporting at the border. And just like to Celia, we run into a pair of siblings who came in on Monday, were detained by CBP, had the phone number for their mother who lives in the U.S. We have contacted the mother. That’s the only way they know her kids are here because CBP today, Thursday has not contacted that mother. So when can we expect your promise of things getting better with contacting and experiencing-\nJoe Biden: (58:19)\nWell, they’re already getting better, but they’re going to get real, I got a whole hell of a lot better real quicker. We’re going to hear some people leaving. Okay. We can get this done. We’re going to get it done. I had a long meeting with the entire team and several cabinet level officers the other night. We’re going to be moving within the next week, over a hundred thousand, I mean a thousand people out of the border patrol into safe, secure beds and facilities. We’re going to significantly ramp up, we’re already out there contacting everyone from getting some of the employees at HHS. And there’s a lot of them doing other things and move them into making those calls. We’re in the process of rearranging and providing for the personnel needed to get that done. But I admire the fact that you were down there.\nJoe Biden: (59:15)\nYou’re making the calls yourself. It’s real. The next thing that has to happen though, as you well know, has to happen, there have to be some certitude that this is the actually mom, dad, or whomever. And there’s ways to do that. There’s ways to do that a little bit like determining whether or not you got the right code for your credit card. What was your dog’s name kind of thing. I’m being a bit facetious, but not really. And also seeking harder data from DNA to birth certificates, which takes longer. So I want to do this as quickly, as humanly possible and as safely as possible.\nYamiche: (59:56)\nAs we all know, treating the root causes in Latin America doesn’t change things overnight. How do you realistically and physically keep these families from coming to the U.S when things will not get better in their countries right away?\nJoe Biden: (01:00:11)\nWell, I can’t guarantee that but I know that all thing, the journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step. You know as well as I do, you cover it. You have serious… It’s not like somebody sitting on a Hanuman table in Guatemala, I mean somewhere in Mexico or in Guadalupe said, “I got a great idea. Let’s sell everything we have, give it to a coyote. Have them take our kids across the border into a desert where they don’t speak the language. Won’t that be fun? Let’s go.” That’s not how it happens. People don’t want to leave. When my great grandfather got in a coffin ship in the Irish Sea expectation was was he going to live long enough on that ship to get to the United States of America. But they left because of what the Brits had been doing. They were in real, real trouble.\nJoe Biden: (01:01:10)\nThey didn’t want to leave, but they had no choice. So we can’t, I can’t guarantee we’re going to solve everything, but I can guarantee we can make everything better. We can make it better. We can change the lives of so many people. And the other thing I want to point out to you, and I hope you point out, I realize it’s much more heart-wrenching and it is to deal with a five and six and seven year old, but you went down there and you saw the vast majority of these children. 70% are 16 years old, 17 years old and mostly males. That make it good or bad or different. But the idea that we have tens of thousands of kids in these God off of facilities that are really little babies crying all night, there’s some, that’s true. That’s why we got to act.\nJoe Biden: (01:02:01)\nAnd yesterday I asked my team both the director of the two agencies, as well as others. I asked them what would they in fact, and I asked their opinion because they’re the experts. But I said, “Focus on the most vulnerable immediately.” But there’s no reason why in the next month, as people crossed the border, that phone call can’t be made in the first 48 hours and began.\nYamiche: (01:02:26)\nIf I may I ask one last question, have you had any talks with Senate Republicans who are threatening this administration with not considering the immigration legislation that was passed in the house until the situation at the border has been resolved?\nJoe Biden: (01:02:41)\nNo, because I know they have to posture for a while. They sort of got to get out of their system. This is a… But I’m ready to work with any Republican who wants to help solve the problem or make the situation better. But folks, I’m going.

Second and related to this, there was no constraint on shops or individuals on the sale of weapons that had been manufactured before the start date, provided just that they were legally owned at the time the law went into effect.  Third, “semiautomatic assault weapons” (which included handguns and certain shotguns, in addition to rifles such as the AR-15) were defined quite precisely in the Act.  But with that precision, gun manufacturers could make what were essentially cosmetic changes, with the new weapons then not subject to the Act.  And fourth, with the sunset provision after 10 years (i.e. to September 12, 2004), the Republican-controlled Congress of 2004 (and President George W.

And it brought down these mass killings.\"", "orig_verdict": "Evidence gets stronger", "fulltext": "Remarks by President Biden on the Shooting in Boulder, Colorado\n12:55 P.M. EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT: There’s still a great deal we don’t know about the killer and the motivation of the killer in Boulder, Colorado, and other critical aspects of this mass shooting. I’ve been briefed this morning by the Attorney General of the United States, the Director of the FBI. I’ve spoken with the governor, and I’ll be speaking with the mayor on the aircraft.\nWe’re working very closely with the state and local law enforcement officials, and they’re going to keep me updated as they learn more. You’re going to ask me to speculate — understandably, you’re going to ask me to speculate on what happened, why it happened. And I’m not going to do that now because we don’t have all the information — not until I have all the facts.\nBut I do know this: As President, I can use all the resources at my disposal to keep the American people safe. As I said: At this moment, a great deal remains unknown. But three things are certain. First, 10 lives have been lost, and more families have been shattered by gun violence in the state of Colorado. And Jill and I are devastated. And the feeling — I just can’t imagine how the families are feeling — the victims whose futures were stolen from them, from their families, from their loved ones who now have to struggle to go on and try to make sense of what’s happened.\nLess than a week after the horrific murders of eight people and the assault on the AAPI community in Georgia, while the flag was still flying half-staff for the tragedy, another American city has been scarred by gun violence and the resulting trauma.\nAnd the state that — I even hate to say it because we’re saying it so often: My heart goes out. Our hearts go out for the survivors. The — who had to — had to flee for their lives and who hid, terrified, unsure if they would ever see their families again, their friends again. The consequences of all this are deeper than I suspect we know. By that, I mean the mental consequences — a feeling of — anyway, it just — we’ve been through too many of these.\nThe second point I want to make is: My deepest thanks to the heroic police and other first responders who acted so quickly to address the situation and keep the members of their community safe. To state the obviously — the obvious, I commend the exceptional bravery of Officer Eric Talley. I send my deepest condolences to his family — his close, close family and seven children.\nYou know, when he pinned on that badge yesterday morning, he didn’t know what the day would bring. I want everybody to think about this: Every time an officer walks out of his or her home and pins that badge on, a family member that they just said goodbye to wonders whether they’ll — subconsciously — will they get that call. The call that his wife got.\nHe thought he’d be coming home to his family and his seven children. But when the moment to act came, Officer Talley did not hesitate in his duty, making the ultimate sacrifice in his effort to save lives. That’s a definition of an American hero.\nAnd thirdly, I want to be very clear — this is the one thing I do know enough to say on it, in terms of what’s happened there: While we’re still waiting for more information regarding the shooter; his motive; the weapons he used — the guns, the magazines, the weapons, and the modifications that apparently have taken place to those weapons that are involved here — I don’t need to wait another minute, let alone an hour, to take commonsense steps that will save the lives in the future and to urge my colleagues in the House and Senate to act.\nWe can ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in this country once again. I got that done when I was a senator. It passed. It was law for the longest time, and it brought down these mass killings. We should do it again.\nWe can close the loopholes in our background check system, including the “Charleston loophole.” That’s one of the best tools we have right now to prevent gun violence. The Senate should immediately pass — let me say it again: The United States Senate — I hope some are listening — should immediately pass the two House-passed bills that close loopholes in the background check system. These are bills that received votes of both Republicans and Democrats in the House. This is not and should not be a partisan issue; this is an American issue. It will save lives — American lives — and we have to act. We should also ban assault weapons in the process.\nI’ll have much more to say as we learn more, but I wanted to be clear: Those poor folks who died left behind families — that leaves a big hole in their hearts. And — and we can save lives increasing the background checks so that they’re supposed to occur, and eliminating assault weapons and the size of magazines. We don’t know all the detail yet on that. But I’ll be talking to you more later today or in the next couple of days about what else we know.\nMay God bless you all and those families who are mourning today because of gun violence in Colorado and Georgia and all across the country. We have to act so there’s not more of you — there’s fewer of you, as time goes on.\nThank you so much.\nQ Will you introduce new gun legislation, Mr. President?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I’ll talk to you about that later. Thank you.\n1:02 P.M.

Why did you leave Brazil?\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's a lot of violence down there.\nRADDATZ (voice-over): At the heart of an emerging crisis for the Biden presidency.\nJOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I can say quite clearly, don't come. And while we're in the process of getting set up is to be able to apply for asylum in place.\nRADDATZ (on camera): What more can he do?\nGOV. DOUG DUCEY (R-AZ): He has got a big microphone. He needs to use it.\nRADDATZ (voice-over): Facing a massive influx of migrants and unaccompanied minors, concerns about dire conditions at crowded facilities.\nWe take you on our journey along the border, in the air and on the ground, in Mexico and on this side of the wall.\n(on camera): What do you think should have happened?\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Collaboration.\nRADDATZ: Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas brings us the administration's perspective, the Republican response from Texas Representative Michael McCaul and Arizona Governor Doug Ducey.\nPlus, the latest analysis from our team joining us in El Paso.\nAnd:\nBIDEN: Hate can have no safe harbor in America.\nRADDATZ: Heartbreak and outrage across the country, the Asian American community shaken and on edge. We discuss the road ahead with Representative Judy Chu.\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\nANNOUNCER: From ABC News, this is a special edition of \"This Week\" live from El Paso, Texas.\nHere now, co-anchor Martha Raddatz.\nRADDATZ: Good morning, and welcome to \"This Week.\"\nWe join you this morning from El Paso, Texas -- Mexico just beyond that fence you see right behind me, so many on the other side desperate to cross the border, and so many here on U.S. soil calling for change, pressuring the Biden administration, loath to label this a crisis, even as the tide of migrants surges.\nThe number of unaccompanied children and teenagers in Border Patrol custody reaching record numbers, children forced to stay longer in overcrowded facilities, the media not allowed inside, the administration restricting access, despite promising transparency, citing COVID and privacy concerns.\nThe issue that at times plagued the previous administration now presenting a challenge to the Biden administration, one that shows no sign of abating anytime soon.\nWe will examine all the angles this morning.\nMoments ago, I spoke with Biden's homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas.\nBut, first, despite the obstacles, we begin this morning with exclusive reporting along and above the border, speaking with stakeholders and those making the treacherous journey to the U.S.\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\nRADDATZ (voice-over): Flying low and fast over the dust of Arizona's desert, the view of the Southern border is stark. Arizona's Department of Public Safety rangers, who provide search-and-rescue, show us miles of wall and gaps where construction was halted after Joe Biden took office.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You can see where the construction ends right there.\nRADDATZ: One of President Biden's first executive actions was to dismantle the Trump administration's immigration policies, tough policies that critics considered shameful.\nJEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We made a policy decision that that was the right, humane step to take.\nRADDATZ: And while the numbers usually increase after the winter, devastating hurricanes in Central America last year may have prompted more to attempt the trip.\nCustoms and Border Protection show, overall, a nearly 30 percent increase last month from January, with 100,000 people attempting to cross the Southwest border. Nearly 30,000 of them were unaccompanied minors.\nThis group from Venezuela crossing the river near Del Rio, Texas, a small boy carried across on shoulders, his feet skimming the water, 50 miles away, a similar scene.\nJON ANFINSEN, CUSTOMS AND BORDER PATROL FIELD AGENT: A group of four just crossed the river. Agents are here already. So, they made it across. They're going to go to a processing center. And we will see from there. This happens every day.\nRADDATZ: The significant surge coming after President Biden ended Donald Trump's so-called remain-in-Mexico policy, requiring asylum seekers to wait there for their court proceedings.\nSince then, many of those tent cities along the Mexican border have emptied out, as people start streaming in.\nWe were there when a bus of 56 asylum seekers arrived at Casa Alitas, a Catholic charity shelter in Tucson. Men, pregnant women, and children stepping off the bus with only what they could carry.\nThis father who asked we not show his face, traveled to Mexico from Brazil with his wife and three young kids before crossing the border.\n(on camera): Would you have tried to do this when Donald Trump was president?\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Definitely not. Definitely. We had the chance, you know, the same violence that's going on today was there last year. We used to watch the news, I definitely wouldn't do this.\nRADDATZ: So did you come here because Joe Biden was elected president?\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Basically. Basically. The main thing was the violence in my country. And the second thing I think was Joe Biden. You know, it's like it lightened up my hope, you know what I mean?\n(voice-over): Director Pena Lopez (ph) has seen a steady uptick.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think right now we're going to be dealing with fixing years of policies that really inhibited people's rights to claim asylum and find a safe place to go.\nRADDATZ (on camera): You've heard some call this a crisis right now. Is it a crisis?\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The crisis really started when we stopped supporting these people. This is just really a consequence of those decisions.\nRADDATZ (voice-over): But for those charged with protecting border towns, the problem has gotten much worse in the past few months.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're losing all our resources.\nRADDATZ (on camera): Why?\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look at the checkpoints. They're down because they have been diverted to other assignments. They have become child care and processing instead of securing the border.\nRADDATZ (voice-over): Sheriff Mark Dannells (ph) drove us through Cochise County, Arizona.\n(on camera): What change have you seen in the past couple of months?\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: A big difference. The messaging has change. And the message is that this border is open for business and you can come across. And if you get across, there will be no consequences. That's the message we hear.\nRADDATZ (voice-over): Arizona Governor Doug Ducey feels the same.\nGOV. DOUG DUCEY (R), ARIZONA: To have 460 percent spike in illegal apprehensions, over 100,000 people in custody, 13,000 migrant children. This is a historic record for the agency. It has been the reverse of the Biden administration of the Trump policies, and it needs attention.\nRADDATZ: We flew alongside the governor as he took an aerial tour of the border to see the situation for himself. He says Joe Biden is to blame.\n(on camera): And what is it exactly? Is it the remain in Mexico? What has made the huge difference, or is it, as your sheriff says, it's the messaging?\nDUCEY: Well, it's a combination of things. Of course, the Migrant Protection Protocols was a good policy, and it was working. It disincentivized people from taking this dangerous trip.\nRADDATZ: You heard President Biden say the other day, don't come. What more can he do?\nDUCEY: Well, he certainly can communicate more often, more clearly, and he should be talking to President Obrador. He has got a big microphone. He needs to use it appropriately.\nRADDATZ (voice-over): But the Biden administration has turned back the majority of those crossing in the U.S., many distraught after believing they would find refuge in America.\nWe walked into Juarez, Mexico, a city wracked with violence, to find Ophelia (ph) and her 10-year-old son now headed back to Guatemala after being sent back to Mexico. The reason she risked everything?\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): Biden promised that we can cross with minors.\nRADDATZ: She said she heard that because of President Biden, she would be welcome.\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\nRADDATZ: And joining me now is the secretary of homeland security, Alejandro Mayorkas.\nGood morning, Mr. Secretary. I want to start right there. We heard the sheriff say it, the governor say it, and the migrants I spoke to say it. They are coming across because they believe they will be welcomed under the Biden administration. You said yourself three weeks ago, we're not saying don't come, we're saying don't come now. President Biden had a stronger message later, but the messages are mixed at best, Mr. Secretary.\nALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: Martha, good morning. The message is quite clear, do not come. The border is closed. The border is secure. We are expelling families. We are expelling single adults under the CDC's authority under Title 42 of the United States Code because we are in the midst of a pandemic, and that is a public health imperative.\nWe are encouraging children not to come. Now is not the time to come. Do not come. The journey is dangerous.\nWe are building safe, orderly and humane ways to address the needs of vulnerable children. Do not come.\nRADDATZ: I know you’re trying to get that message out now, but your team was also briefed by career professionals at DHS during the transition about the possibility of this crisis. You yourself say we are on pace to have one of the largest migrant surges in 20 years. Why were you not prepared for this?\nMAYORKAS: Martha, let me let me be clear. We have seen large numbers of migration in the past. We know how to address it. We have a plan. We are executing on our plan and we will succeed. This is what we do.\nBut one thing is also clear, that it takes time. And why is what does it take time now? Why is it especially challenging and difficult now? Because the entire system under United States law that has been place throughout administrations of both parties was dismantled in its entirety by the Trump administration.\nSo, we are rebuilding the system as we address the needs of vulnerable children who arrived at our borders. And that is what it is all about. It’s about vulnerable children.\n(CROSSTALK)\nRADDATZ: But, Mr. Secretary, you knew that coming in.\nIt’s exactly about vulnerable children. You have approximately 5,200 children currently being held in adult border facilities, well over the 2019 peak, during the Trump administration. They’re only supposed to stay there for 72 hours, but they’ve been there for more than 10 days, 650 kids, and it’s getting worse.\nLet me read you a tweet from Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut who was with you on the trip down there. He said, Just left the border processing facility. Hundreds of kids packed into big open rooms. In a corner, I fought back tears as a 13 year old girl sobbed uncontrollably explaining thru a translator how terrified she was, having been separated from her grandmother and without her parents.\nMurphy said these are facilities you wouldn’t want to put your child in for more than 10 minutes.\nI know you say you have a plan now. But again, how did this happen? We knew there was a pandemic before. HHS has failed to do this before as well under Obama, under President Trump.\nBut how do you speed this up and how did this happen?\nMAYORKAS: Martha, it takes time. We all know what happened that 13 year old in the prior administration. She was turned away and turned in to the desert of Mexico or sent back to the very country for which she fled, by reason of fear or prosecution.\nWe are addressing the needs of that child now. And when I say it takes time, I mean it because we’re dealing with the dismantled system. And we did not have the ordinary safe and just transition from one administration to another.\nAnd so, we are executing on our plans. We have dispatched FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Administration, to assist HHS in building additional capacity to address the needs of children and to move those children through to their sponsors in the United States to shelter them in a way that they deserve and that their needs require.\nThat is what we are doing. When people speak, well, you knew of this, plans aren’t made at 20,000 feet. Plans are contracts, personnel, policies, training, procedures, all of the elements of operations that were entirely dismantled. And taking care of the workforce that was not vaccinated and --\n(CROSSTALK)\nRADDATZ: Mr. Secretary, Mr. Secretary, I want to stop you there and I want to know, if you got this great plan, why would you not let the media in? I understand privacy concerns, but will you let them today or this week?\nMAYORKAS: Martha, it is not only privacy concerns. Let me be clear, we’re in the midst of the pandemic. We’re talking about a crowded Border Patrol station where we are focused on operations.\nAt the same time, and let me assure you, that we are working on a plan to provide access so that people could see what is going on a Border Patrol station and I would encourage people to also see the Department of Health and Human Services facility where the children are sheltered and where they belong and where we are moving them to.\nRADDATZ: You talk about the Trump administration and what was in place there. You did away with that. Wouldn't it have been better to have a plan before you did away with that?\nMAYORKAS: We are executing the plan that we have. And let me share with you -- because we will succeed. And when we look back at this time, however difficult it has been, we will get through it, we will get through it successfully.\nWhat we will all say is that we worked our way through a difficult time. We administered the laws as they were intended, and we lived up to our values and our principles as a nation. And that is what we are accomplishing. And that is not what was done in the prior administration.\nIt's tough, but we can do it. This is what we do, and we will accomplish our mission.\nRADDATZ: And, Mr. Secretary, I want to turn to the terrible news this week from Atlanta, the deadly shootings which claimed eight lives, six of them Asian-Americans. There's been a terrible surge of violence and hatred.\nWhat concrete steps are being taken to address this?\nMAYORKAS: Martha, let me -- let me first say that our hearts and prayers are with the -- the victims of the tragic shootings in the -- in the surrounding areas of Atlanta. And we are very focused on the increase in hate crimes targeting the Asian-American Pacific islander community and many other groups.\nWe are very focused on domestic violent extremism. It is the single greatest terrorism-related threat that we face in our homeland.\nWe are focused on gathering intelligence and information and sharing it in actionable form with our state, local, tribal and territorial partners. We are working with the office of civil rights and civil liberties in addressing the challenges with the social media companies to ensure that we stop the violence that is born of ideologies of hate, and we are engaging with the community.\nWe held a very significant nationwide engagement with the Asian-American Pacific islander community last Friday. There are many things that we already have done and that we intend to do to address this very grave threat that we face in our country. And let me also echo the very powerful words of the president. Words do matter.\nRADDATZ: Thank you very much for joining us this morning, Mr. Secretary. We appreciate it.\nMAYORKAS: Thank you, Martha.\nRADDATZ: Let's get a response now from Texas Congressman Michael McCaul, top Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee.\nGreat to see you. Thank you for joining us here.\nThe administration has essentially, as you heard, blamed Trump policies for this.\nREP. MICHAEL MCCAUL, (R) TEXAS: No, I think they've created the crisis. He says he has a plan. I haven't seen a plan. They talk about humane conditions, humanitarian. They have created a humanitarian crisis down here at this border that you have seen now. And the reason why they are coming is because he says words do matter, and they do. The messaging is that if you want to come, you can stay.\nWhen Mayorkas says we're not saying don't come at all, just don't come, very irresponsible rhetoric for a secretary of Homeland Security to say. And now, in his words, we have the greatest -- well, not crisis, because he won't call it that, in 20 years.\nYou know, in this sector alone, where I used to be a federal prosecutor, spiking 230 percent from last year, there is a direct cause and effect on the messaging. But then to do away, you know, politics aside, to do away with what was one of the most successful negotiated agreements with Mexico and Central America, to remain in Mexico and apply for political asylum, but now they've created this -- this crisis of children coming in. The traffickers are smart. Cartels are smart. They know our laws, policies And this started right after the election. And in the last two months we've seen a real surge.\nRADDATZ: You -- you -- you talk about the messaging. Clearly what he was trying to do is have a stronger message and forget about what was said three weeks ago.\nIs that enough? They're clearly starting to change that messaging now even though word has not gotten out to Mexico across the border.\nMCCAUL: I think it's too little too late because the traffickers know they can take children from Central America, extort the families, exploit the children on the dangerous journey back to the United States. And now, you know, they're calling back home saying, hey, we got in.\nSo until this policy changes, I would urge the administration to revisit the migrant protection protocols.\nThis worked, and it was very effective.\nRADDATZ: I want to stop you there, though. Human Rights Watch says, because of that policy, they have consistently found that migrants in Mexico are exposed to rape, kidnapping, extortion, assault and psychological trauma. Nearly half of those interviewed said Mexican police, immigration agents or criminal groups targeted them for extortion. How is that a good policy?\nMCCAUL: Well, it's -- it's a good policy because it deterred. Deterrence is the key here. And, you know, Secretary Mayorkas knows better...\nRADDATZ: Well, it deterred, but it left people in Mexico in pretty bad shape.\nMCCAUL: Well, it also deterred a lot of them from leaving Central America. I talked to the ambassador from Guatemala. He said, you know, \"My children were staying in my country. What I worry about now is I have a generation leaving my country. We want to keep them here, so we want to work on private investments in Central America, get to the root cause.\"\nBut this is -- this is -- it's a humanitarian crisis, when you see the children and the babies -- we're going back to separation of families, and the traffickers are separating the children from the families. And we're going back to catch-and-release. And we're going back to kids in cages all over again. And this is something that President Trump and his policies, with respect to Remain in Mexico and Central America, had stopped.\nRADDATZ: So is the solution here to do what Donald Trump did and build more of the wall? You know Joe Biden is not going to do that. So...\nMCCAUL: No.\nRADDATZ: So what do you suggest happens right now, for your constituents in Texas especially?\nMCCAUL: Well, I think -- I've always been a believer in technology. This stuff works in the high populated areas, to -- that's, you know, that's Juarez over here. We're in El Paso. But technology between these ports of entry and aviation assets that you saw the other day worked very effectively. And then we got to return to this political asylum issue and have them apply in country of origin or in Mexico.\nIf he changed it, he can call the program whatever he wants, brand it whatever he wants, but we've got to go back to this policy.\nRADDATZ: And -- and you opposed a measure that just passed in the House that would provide a pathway to citizenship for the so-called Dreamers. Why shouldn't undocumented children who were brought to this country as children, no fault of their own, be given some rights towards citizenship?\nMCCAUL: Well, in -- in my Secure America Act that we tried to pass when we had the majority had a legalization for the DACA kids, a legal path. We had a guest worker program as well. And unfortunately, immigration is obviously a very difficult topic.\nBut the point is, Martha, neither one of those bills addressed this problem. They have nothing to do with this, and they won't solve this problem. In fact, again going back to deterrence and messaging, it sends the exact wrong message.\nRADDATZ: So what do you think the next few weeks, few months, will look like? He said that we have a plan and we'll look back on this and say everything was solved?\nMCCAUL: Look, I -- I've known the border when I was chairman of Homeland Security. I was a federal prosecutor down here. Mayorkas knows better because he was, too. It's going to get worse. It's going to get a lot worse, springtime, summer, more and more come over.\nThe message is coming back that, \"Hey, we've got a new president; come on in; we're open for business to the traffickers.\" And guess what? They're right here. And I predict a million people trying to get into this country by the summertime.\nRADDATZ: OK. Thanks so much for joining us this morning, Congressman. Always great to see you. Thanks for welcoming us to Texas.\nMCCAUL: Thanks, Martha.\nRADDATZ: Up next, Terry Moran, Matt Gutman and Laura Barron-Lopez join the powerhouse roundtable, here in El Paso, to separate fact from fiction on the immigration debate. Our special edition of \"This Week\" live from the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas continues in a moment.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nGEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I was deeply concerned about the rhetoric around immigration.\nNot only do I think immigrants renew our soul and bring a spirit to our country, but, also, it helps our economy. One of the problems is, immigration has become overly politicized. And it's really a rebuke of Congress' inability to come together to get something done on immigration.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nRADDATZ: Former President George W. Bush weighing in on the immigration debate that dates back even beyond his presidency.\nLet's discuss it all with our roundtable live with us in Texas, ABC news senior national correspondent Terry Moran, ABC news senior national correspondent -- senior -- I have these titles mixed up, Matt, so, so many -- chief national correspondent Matt Gutman and Politico White House correspondent Laura Barron-Lopez.\nThanks to you all.\nSpeaking of national correspondents, Matt, I want to start with you.\nYou have spent years covering the border. Put what's happening here in perspective, based on what you just heard as well, more than 5,000 unaccompanied minors now in adult facilities.\nMATT GUTMAN, ABC NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This is unprecedented, Martha. We have never seen numbers like these inside these border patrol facilities, which in some cases are jail-like, in most cases, are warehouse-like.\nThis is pretty much twice the number at the peak in 2018-'19, right? And what we're seeing in some of these facilities is overcrowding that almost boggles the mind.\nIn one facility, in Donna, Texas, it has a capacity of 250 beds. There are 3,900 kids inside there. We heard Secretary Mayorkas talking about the threat of COVID. I mean, can you imagine the kind of social distancing they have there? There is none.\nAnd we're talking about children and teens. And, in many cases, you have 17-year-olds in the same rooms as 4-year-olds and 5-year-olds.\nAnd activists with whom I'm talking to, immigration lawyers are saying this is untenable. They are extraordinarily concerned, not only of an outbreak of COVID, of the flu, but that somebody is going to get hurt.\nAnd, Martha, this is something that Border Patrol and CBP officials up and down the line echo as well. Their greatest fear right now is that a child is going to die in their custody.\nRADDATZ: And we certainly hope that doesn't happen.\nTerry, what choice did Biden have, given that he wanted to do away with these policies of Donald Trump that he saw as cruel and xenophobic?\nTERRY MORAN, ABC NEWS SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think do it in a more orderly fashion, as, essentially, Secretary Mayorkas acknowledged, that they said they had a broken immigration system.\nIf you're going to do something that big, do a 180 -- President Biden did it in the first couple of days, almost performatively. He wanted to send a message to the American people that a more humane, a different kind of immigration policy was going to take place under his administration.\nBut he sent that message, as you pointed out, south of the border. This border right here is -- that marks the largest in person wage differential across any land border in the world. You can make a lot more money in the United States.\nAnd as parts of that region fall into narco-terrorism and gangsterism, corruption, the pressure is tremendous. And to do that 180 without really any preparation, he owns this now. He owns it.\nRADDATZ: And, Laura, he really does.\nAnd should they have been more aware? I mean, they really seemed tone-deaf to the politics of this as well. You heard Mayorkas trying to do cleanup, I think, there, trying to send this strong message. But is it too late?\nLAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, POLITICO: Well, that's what you see so many of the administration officials including Mayorkas, as well Roberta Jacobson, the southern border coordinator for the White House, they’re starting to change their tune. They're saying, we're not saying don't come. We’re saying, don't come like this ever, or come in the legal fashion.\nBut again, there are so many -- there's such a big influx, and I was talking to advocates here in El Paso yesterday, and they were saying that they feel as though beyond the rollback in Mexico which they felt as though went well according to the advocates and activists, beyond that they feel as if the White House doesn't have a plan in terms of how to address not just the children, but the adults and families that are coming over here.\nAnd when migrants are being released into South Texas, or they're being transferred here to El Paso, that there isn't enough testing, COVID testing for them, that they aren't sure where they're supposed to go, and they really -- as Matt said, they feel like it's not a sustainable situation here.\nRADDATZ: And, Matt, explain how you get a child who is unaccompanied as a border as one. It is little more complicated than that, and explain what the difference is now between separating these families and what happened under President Trump.\nMATT GUTMAN, ABC NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: You think of the notion of a toddler just strolling across the border, and it's something that boggles the mind, but that's not exactly what's happening, Martha. Parents aren't sending their kids over as 1 or 2-year-olds, right?\nTypically, what will happen is that child will come with a guardian, a grandmother, somebody that child has come with, an aunt, and because they are not their parents, they will be separated, and that guardian can choose to either go back to Mexico with the child or say, will be listen. This child might have a better life than I was able to give it in the United States, and I might subject it to some trauma now, but maybe that's better in the long haul. So, that's one of the things we're seeing this.\nThere are really three pillars of this surge right now. There is, you know, climate change which is decimating Central America, these hurricanes we've just seen, and political and economic upheaval. Plus, the fact that people do think they're going to get a warmer welcome under President Trump, and it does differ from family separation, and assets of families were coming over together and the administration under President Trump was forcefully dividing them, and that is something that obviously Mayorkas and the Biden administration have tried to fix, and they are doing that.\nRADDATZ: And, Terry, President Biden again said, don't come, to our George Stephanopoulos. He also said, we're in the process of getting set up, and it's not going to take a whole long time, to be able to apply for asylum in place. So don't leave your town or city or community.\nThat sounds a little bit like remain in Mexico.\nTERRY MORAN, ABC NEWS SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Essentially, it's to take the pressure off this border, and try to establish the kind of immigration policy and process that the majority of American people want. I mean, hearing former President Bush say it renews the soul of the country, I think that's probably a majority opinion in this country.\nBut you get disorder at the border, you get this kind of chaos and inhumanity, that's the quickest way to kill immigration reform. People want an orderly, secure, reliable border, and a generous immigration policy, and he's got neither right now.\nRADDATZ: And, Laura, Republicans obviously are very critical of Joe Biden. That's no surprise. But here in Texas, there were eight heavily Latino counties that flipped to Trump, voted for Hillary Clinton before. They like what Trump did here.\nBARRON-LOPEZ: Yes, to a degree. There are a majority of Latinos in Texas did vote for President Biden, but there was noticeable change in where Latino voters voted in certain districts across South Texas, and that's also why there is so much urgency from the Biden administration to pass immigration reform, to show he sent a bill to congress.\nNow, the big question though is that comprehensive immigration reform probably doesn't stand a chance in the Congress because of the 50/50 split Senate. And so, just this past week, we saw House Democrats passed narrower bills, a bill that would just address of a pathway of citizenship for Dreamers, address the pathway to citizenship for farm workers. But the likelihood of that actually even though smaller tailored bills getting votes in the Senate or having ten Republicans is very slim. So, that's going to be a really difficult road ahead for the administration.\nRADDATZ: OK. Thanks to all of you. Stay in place here.\nThe roundtable will be back in a moment for more, but first, the increasing assault on Asian-Americans in this country, and that horrific series of shootings in Atlanta. What's being done to confront that problem and that hatred in America? We'll have the very latest, next.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nRADDATZ: America. We'll have the very latest, next.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nRADDATZ: As violent surges against the Asian-American community, what will Congress do to address the growing threat? The chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, Judy Chu joins me next.\nStay with us.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n(UNKNOWN): Our community is bleeding. We are in pain. And for the last year, we've been screaming out for help.\n(UNKNOWN): What we can say and should say clearly, unambiguously, is that blaming the AAPI community for a public health crisis is racist and wrong.\n(UNKNOWN): Asian Americans must not be used as scapegoats in times of crisis. Lives are at stake.\nRADDATZ: Three lawmakers, including our next guest, testifying before Congress about the threats against the Asian American Pacific Islander community following that heinous attack in Georgia that left eight dead, including six women of Asian descent.\nThat deadly rampage comes amid a surge in assaults on the nations AAPI community since the start of the COVID pandemic. There have been nearly 3,800 anti-Asian hate incidents reported in the U.S. In just the first two months of 2021, there were over 500 incidents reported.\nCalifornia Congresswoman Judy Chu was the first Chinese-American woman elected to Congress, and she's currently serving as the chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. And Congresswoman Chu joins us now.\nThank you for joining us.\nInvestigators say they haven't found concrete evidence that the gunman in Atlanta targeted these businesses and victims because of their ethnicities. But do you believe that this was a hate crime against Asian Americans and should be prosecuted as such?\nCHU: First, my heart breaks for the eight victims. And as I read more about them, I see that they were hard-working. Many were mothers. One was as old as 74 years old. And, yes, I do strongly believe that this is a hate crime.\nThis is a 21-year-old white male who chose, as his first victim, a business that was called Young's Asian Massage. Then he drove for 27 miles to another spot where he hit two more Asian spas.\nIf his only problem was sex addiction, then he could have had his choice in those 27 miles of any place that he could have gone to. But, no, he specifically went to those Asian spas, where it was clear in all three places there would be many Asian women. And indeed, those were the majority of those that he shot and killed.\nNow, I know the legal bar is high because they have to find somebody who heard him say that there was an anti-Asian slur expressed at the time. But I would say, look, these were places where people spoke another language. They may not have heard him. They may be dead. But in my mind and in the minds of many, this is an anti-Asian hate crime.\nRADDATZ: You want Congress to act and have singled out two bills, the No Hate Act and the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. Can you first explain for viewers what these bills would do and, secondly, are you confident they can get enough Republican support to become law?\nCHU: Well, first of all, let me say that we have been working for a year to try to get some action done against these anti-Asian hate crimes. But President Trump doubled down with his rhetoric about the China virus and the Wuhan virus and even Kung Flu.\nAnd it wasn't until President Biden came and issued that executive memorandum saying that the Asian community should be able to meet with the Department of Justice to provide solutions to these anti-Asian hate crimes that we were able to actually move forward.\nAnd in fact, we had that meeting with the Department of Justice last week. We are also pushing for two...\nRADDATZ: And you...\nCHU: ... anti-Asian -- yes?\nRADDATZ: Go ahead. Go ahead.\nCHU: And we are also pushing for -- yeah, we're also pushing forward, of course, these two hate crime bills. One is called the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. And this one would direct the Department of Justice to have somebody appointed to track these crimes and to make sure that they are going through the system and being prosecuted, and providing guidelines on these types of hate crimes, in terms of their prosecution.\nThe NO HATE Act would address our very flawed hate crimes system in this country. Our reporting is very flawed, because it relies on local law enforcement agencies to voluntarily provide such statistics. But 18 states don't even track such data. Three states don't even have a hate crime statute in the law.\nSo, hate crimes in this country are very undercounted. And, also, the NO HATE Act would provide resources for law enforcement to be able to put such a program together, and actually get training on how they deal with hate crimes, and provide oversight that would be done by the U.S. attorney general, who would report to Congress.\nRADDATZ: OK, thanks very much, Congresswoman Chu. I know you and your colleagues are calling for this Friday to be a national day to speak out against Asian hate.\nUp next: the very latest on the Biden administration's national vaccination efforts, plus its clashes with China and Russia this week.\nThe roundtable returns, as our special edition of \"This Week\" live from Texas continues.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nRADDATZ: There's more roundtable just ahead.\nWe're back in 60 seconds.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nJOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Tomorrow, we will hit 100 million doses our administration has administered, but I always said, that's just the floor. We will not stop until we beat this pandemic. This is a time for optimism, but it's not a time for relaxation. I need all Americans -- I need all of you to do your part.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nMARTHA RADDATZ, ABC NEWS \"THIS WEEK\" CO-ANCHOR: President Biden celebrating the U.S. clearing his goal of 100 million coronavirus shots well before the target date of the 100th day in office.\nWe're back now with the round table.\nAnd, Terry, let's talk about -- let’s talk about COVID. He did meet that goal. Big accomplishment for this administration, or was the bar too low?\nTERRY MORAN, ABC NEWS SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It was a low bar, but it was an accomplishment for this administration and the previous one, no question that \"Operation Warp Speed\" under President Trump got the ball rolling and it would be nice perhaps for President Biden to say that.\nBut the wheels are turning faster now it feels like. There is a lot more supply. The problem is getting it down that last mile.\nI was with the mobile vaccine unit in rural Maryland recently. They're ready. They're looking forward to get to that point to get it into people's arms. And then there's the question of update, and that's a presidential leadership role as well.\nRADDATZ: And that's exactly right, Laura. Declaring victory a little too early. I know they're celebrating these 100 million shots, but this is far from over.\nLAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, POLITICO WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, there still is a long way to go, Martha. The administration is saying that they -- by the end of May, are hoping to have, you know, vaccines for every person in the U.S. who needs one, for every adult who needs one. So, that still is a goal post they have yet to meet, and again, a lot of this is around vaccine hesitancy. Communities throughout the country, whether they're black, brown or also Republicans who don't want to get the vaccine because of the fears sown by the prior president, by President Trump and others in the illegitimacy of Biden’s election.\nBut again, what they're trying to do is the mobile vans, trying to get vaccines into different pharmacies across the country. They're making sure through communication that hesitant communities are actually starting to get the vaccine and be more willing to get it.\nRADDATZ: And, Matt, schools. You live in L.A., schools were closed for so long, and the CDC released new guidance that students only have to be 3 feet apart instead of 6 feet apart. Obviously, that means you can get more kids in there.\nWhat difference will that make?\nMATT GUTMAN, ABC NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: You know, as a parent myself, I can tell you that most parents that have kids, age of our kids, this is the most important issue. So, this change to three feet is monumental. It means they can bring twice as many kids into the classroom. It means they likely don't have to stagger kids on separate days of the week.\nThe CDC saying this is all based on science, and as I’ve learned being in the field with nurses and doctors for a year working on COVID, they're shoulder to shoulder with their colleagues. If you’re wearing a mask and the other person is too, your chances of contracting the virus are extraordinarily minimal.\nNow, adults still have to remain six feet apart. Kids will have to remain six feet apart in common areas, the auditoriums, cafeterias, but this is a major milestone that hopefully can get kids back in class. There is one hitch, and that is, especially the West Coast, the teachers unions are still demanding that six-foot distance, and they may not return to the classrooms under this new ruling.\nRADDATZ: Got to get them back in there for sure.\nTerry, I want to turn to foreign policy. Before you were our senior national correspondent, you were a foreign correspondent. I want to talk about a couple of important stories, and one of them was the war of words between the U.S. and Russia. It was sparked by comments President Biden made about Vladimir Putin to our George Stephanopoulos.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nGEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS CHIEF ANCHOR: You said you know he doesn't have a soul.\nBIDEN: I did say that to him, yes. And -- and his response was, we understand one another.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So you now Vladimir Putin. You think he's a killer?\nBIDEN: Uh-huh., I do.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nRADDATZ: And Putin shot right back and challenged him to a live debate. I guess that's the new duel. That was quite an exchange though.\nTERRY MORAN, ABC NEWS SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Right. He also wished him good health with a smirk on his face.\nLook you know, Putin understood he -- he's playing a weak hand with Russia. He has done nothing to advance the Russian economy beyond punching holes in the ground and taking stuff out. If you're a young person in Russia, your future is not that great. So there's an asymmetrical power. So he is essentially broken all the rules of world leadership. He kills people. And -- Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia kind of follow his lead. What Biden is trying to do is restore, you know, some kind of normality to world leadership and dismissing him like this in public, labeling him like that bugs Putin, but it helps establishes some kind of norms around what leaders can do.\nRADDATZ: And, Laura, the remarks came as U.S. intelligence released a report that Putin indeed tried to help Donald Trump's re-election bid. But Biden is distancing himself from Trump's approach to Putin. Can these two leaders form a good relationship?\nLAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, POLITICO WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's the big question, right, which is that right now it's very confrontational. The U.S. has taken a combative approach because, as Terry said, Biden is trying to make sure that the U.S. is reasserting its strength compared to the prior administration reasserting its moral authority. And so with that there's probably sanction -- more sanctions around the corner to response to that election meddling, to respond to the Solarwinds attack, to respond to the bounties on troops in Afghanistan. And so, right now, I think the -- the good will down the -- maybe down the road, maybe there could be work down the road, but right now it's looking like a much more aggressive approach.\nRADDATZ: And -- and, Terry, we have just about a minute here, but it wasn't just the confrontation with Russia. The first face to face meeting with Chinese officials turned into a very public airing of grievances.\nMORAN: It was real theater there as -- as Secretary of State Blinken said the United States wants to re-establish this rules-based international order, commitment to international institutions and China's kind of an outlaw on that and he got an earful back, and they went back and forth.\nBut I think one of the things that President Trump did is squandered American leadership in that rules-based order and commitment to international institutions because China's rule in -- in world order is basically, do what China says or we're coming after you. And there's a -- there's an advantage for America to distinguish itself from China that way. That's essentially what played out there. It might not have looked great, but China sent the unmistakable message that they want people to do what they want. And they don't, they're coming after you economically with their espionage in other ways.\nAnd that's actually an opening for the United States to reassert that kind of moral leadership. As President Biden, once again, building on President Trump, is doing with Japan, India and Australia, that quad, trying to res-establish some a check on a Chinese power, which, right now, feel that America's in permanent decline and they are rising and rising and nothing's going to stop them.\nRADDATZ: Always a complicated relationship. A lot to watch for.\nThanks for all of you for coming out to El Paso.\nThat's all for us today.\nThanks to the whole ABC News team that allowed us to broadcast from the border this morning, and thanks to all of you for watching.

But the claims are false: there is no scientific evidence that either medication can help treat the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.\nIn a video posted in English on March 17, 2021, Kenyan doctor Stephen Kimotho Karanja claims that two sets of medication can help treat Covid-19: the anti-parasite drug ivermectin on the one hand, and a mix of the anti-malaria medication hydroxychloroquine, with zinc and azithromycin on the other.\nHe makes the same claim in his native Kikuyu language in a second video posted on Facebook on March 24, 2021.\n\"Covid-19 can be treated. The following drugs are the ones that may be used because they are available, they are cheap, and they can be found in Africa, in Kenya, and in other countries at any time. The backbone is a medicine called ivermectin, normally used for worms, but it is very important in the treatment of Covid-19. The other medicine is hydroxychloroquine, so-called HCQ. When used together with zinc 50 milligrams, it weaponises the zinc, which destroys the Covid-19 virus,\" he says in the videos.\nThe post introduces Karanja as chairman of the Catholic Doctors Association, which released a statement in March calling Covid-19 vaccines \"unnecessary\" and \"unsafe\".\nAFP Fact Check debunked a number of false or misleading claims made in the statement here.\nIvermectin Studies 'Inconclusive'\nScientists working hard to find treatments and vaccines to help treat and prevent Covid-19, which has killed more than 2.8 million people worldwide since it emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019.\nIvermectin is a medication used to fight various parasitic infections. In the US, ivermectin tablets are prescribed to treat parasitic worms, and creams and lotions are used for conditions like head lice and rosacea. However, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved ivermectin to treat or prevent Covid-19.\nIvermectin is used to treat parasitic infections (AFP/ Luis Robayo)\nThe FDA has cautioned against \"a growing interest\" in ivermectin to treat humans with COVID-19.\n\"The FDA has received multiple reports of patients who have required medical support and been hospitalized after self-medicating with ivermectin intended for horses,\" it said on March 5, 2021.\nThe WHO advised that ivermectin was only to be used to treat Covid-19 in clinical trials, according to updated guidelines published on March 31, 2021.\n\"There is no evidence to support the use of ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19. Ivermectin is approved for human use to treat parasitic worms but has not yet been approved to treat or prevent COVID-19. Clinical trials are ongoing to determine the safety and efficacy of the drug in treating COVID-19,\" the UN health agency told AFP Fact Check.\nNairobi-based epidemiologist Emanuel Okunga also said that more trials are needed before drawing conclusions about ivermectin's efficacy.\n\"To be sure about the effectiveness of ivermectin, we need to conduct larger clinical trials, which we don't have at the moment\" he told AFP Fact Check.\nDozens of ivermectin trials around the world are listed on this US database.\nAFP Fact Check has previously debunked several claims about ivermectin drug, including here, here and here.\nHydroxychloroquine 'little to no impact'\nHydroxychloroquine made headlines last year when public figures including former US president Donald Trump and controversial French doctor Didier Raoult falsely touted the drug as a \"cure\" for Covid-19, see here and here.\nKaranja is not the first doctor to suggest mixing hydroxychloroquine with other drugs to treat Covid-19. In July 2020, a video of US-based doctor Stella Immanuel went viral when she claimed that she had successfully treated more than 350 Covid-19 patients with a combination of hydroxychloroquine, zinc and azithromycin.\nScreenshot of the video featuring Dr Stella Immanuel, taken on July 28, 2020\nTrump helped spread the footage of Immanuel by sharing it on his now permanently-suspended Twitter account. AFP Fact Check debunked Immanuel's remarks here.\nNo medical studies support the claim that hydroxychloroquine, either on its own or mixed with zinc and azithromycin, cures Covid-19.\nThe WHO strongly advises against the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 of any severity.\n\"Evidence from these studies shows that hydroxychloroquine has little to no impact on illness, hospitalisation, or death. There is also no evidence that hydroxychloroquine is effective in preventing or treating COVID-19 when mixed with zinc, azithromycin or any other medicine,\" the WHO told AFP Fact Check .\nLast June, the FDA revoked the emergency use authorisation that had allowed hydroxychloroquine from the Strategic National Stockpile -- the US national repository of antibiotics, vaccines, chemical antidotes and other critical medical supplies -- to be used to treat hospitalised Covid-19 patients.\nAnd in August 2020, South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases also cautioned against the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 patients. The agency makes it clear in its Covid-19 guidelines that \"antibiotics do not treat viral infections\".\nAntibiotics don't treat viruses\nAzithromycin, marketed as Zithromax, is a commonly prescribed antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections such as pneumonia, infections of the nose and throat such as sinus infection (sinusitis), skin infections, and strep throat. Antibiotics kill bacteria, not viruses like the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.\nIn December 2020, British scientists concluded, based on preliminary data analysis from the UK's RECOVERY Trial, that azithromycin had \"been found to have no meaningful clinical benefit for patients hospitalized with severe forms of the disease\".\nUnproven zinc claim\nZinc is a nutrient that can help the immune system fight off infection.

His first band was called Bluesology. He later auditioned (unsuccessfully) as lead singer for the progressive rock bands King Crimson and Gentle Giant. Dwight teamed up with lyricist Bernie Taupin and changed his name to Elton John (merging the names of saxophonist Elton Dean and Long John Baldry). The duo wrote songs for Lulu and Roger Cook. In the early 1970s, he recorded the concept album \"Tumbleweed Connection.\" He became the most successful pop artist of the 1970s, and he has survived many different pop fads including punk, the New Romantics and Britpop to remain one of Britain's most internationally acclaimed musicians.\n\nElton John announced he was a bisexual in 1976, and in 1984, he married Renate Blauel. The marriage lasted four years before he finally came to terms with the fact that he was actually homosexual. In the 1970s and 1980s, he suffered from drug and alcohol addiction and bulimia but came through it. He is well known as a campaigner for AIDS research and he keeps his finger on the pulse of modern music, enjoying artists such as Eminem, Radiohead, Coldplay and Robbie Williams.

Há tensão no ar. A despeito de passar tranquilidade na TV, e pedir ao povo para evitar as ruas (um claro cancelamento da convocação das manifestações pró-governo de domingo), Bolsonaro não esconde as evidências dos cuidados com a saúde.

Muito se diz do constrangimento que seria se o secretário de Comunicação do Governo, Fábio Wajngarten, com infecção confirmada, tivesse contaminado o presidente norte-americano Donald Trump. Mas o papo aqui em Brasília é outro. Toda a cúpula do Governo trata com cuidado para não indicar uma suspeita: boa parte da comitiva foi contaminada na Flórida, e pior, no resort Mar a Lago, de propriedade de Trump. Partindo dessa premissa, há risco de Trump estar contaminado, e ele ter passado o vírus no contato pessoal.\nFato é que Trump, cobrado pela imprensa americana, desconversa e diz que não precisa de teste. É no mínimo estranho, para quem já culpou a Europa pelo caos na vigilância sanitária.

It is of course no guarantee and may need to be fought in court at least once to get the full benefit of the protection it could offer.”\nWhat is special about 250,000?\nIt is not true that a group of 250,000 people giving the same answer on the census automatically becomes a “recognised belief system”.

This find occurs only days before the Senate’s audit of the county’s 2020 election results is due to start.\nFor months the Board of Supervisors in Maricopa County have blocked and delayed any independent audit performed by the Arizona Senate of the County’s results in the 2020 Presidential election. As we’ve reported previously, after being subpoenaed by the Arizona Senate and then suing the Senate to prevent a Senate audit of their 2020 election results, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors (MCBOS) agreed to have an audit if they could pick the auditors. The two firms they picked they claimed were the only two who were certified by the governmental body the US Election Assistance Commission (EAC). However, we found that these firms were not certified at the time they were selected by the MCBOS:\nWE CAUGHT THEM: Arizona’s Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Lied – EAC Updated Website after Gateway Pundit Report Discovered Their Auditors Were Uncertified\nThe MCBOS went ahead and hired the firms they wanted to perform their audit but the audits were never structured to find any suspected fraud in the county. The validity of the 2 million ballots in the county was never even considered in the programs reportedly used by these audit firms:\nTRENDING: Dozens of School Districts are Using Book that Claims ‘Whiteness’ is the Devil and That White Children Sell Their Soul for “Stolen Land and Stolen Riches”\nMaricopa County Audits Are Proving to Be a Waste of Time and Money, They Were Never Created to Identify the Suspected Election Fraud in the County\nThis is probably why these audits were set up the way they were (so no fraud would be identified). The auditors came to Phoenix and performed their work and some patriots found out that they could be observed on cameras in the facility where they were doing the work. These patriots watched and even sent a couple of individuals down to the center to check things out late one night.

As the day for their audit approaches the heat must have gotten too hot for those guarding the ballots in Maricopa County.\nPer our source on the ground in the County, yesterday an individual went by the Maricopa County Tabulation and election center and found doors wide open with seeming uninhibited access to the facility.\nToday some other interested individuals in the county stopped by the same facility and found huge piles of ballots in the dumpster outside the facility.\nSomeone ordered the ballots be shredded.\nWe do not yet have the complete information on the shredded ballots.\nThis is not the first state where we found shredded ballots after the election.

Covid-19 deaths are not miscategorised flu deaths.\nA post shared on Facebook shows the number of positive influenza tests for each week from 2015 to 2020, using legitimate graphs from the World Health Organisation (WHO).\nThe graph for 2020 shows the number of positive influenza tests falling to near zero in around week 14 and not really increasing since, with the post commenting “Influenza, finally eradicated.”\nThe account behind the post has also posted various antivax misinformation and suggestions that the Covid-19 epidemic is less serious than it is.\nGiven that, it appears the claim that influenza has been finally eradicated is not meant to be taken seriously and could suggest that flu cases are being mislabelled as Covid-19 cases. Many of the comments on the post suggest this is how it has been interpreted.\nFirstly it’s worth noting that while we seem to be having a very mild flu season, the flu has not been eradicated.\nThe latest data from the WHO shows flu cases starting to increase in the late autumn of 2020. While the number has dropped off recently, this could be due to reporting delays.\nIt’s also not plausible that what are being termed Covid-19 cases are actually flu cases and, by implication, that flu deaths are being mislabelled as Covid-19 deaths.\nIn 2017/18, the worst flu season over the past five years, there were around 22,000 deaths in England associated with flu.\nBy comparison, there have been 78,811 deaths so far from Covid-19 in England and Wales. These are deaths where a medical practitioner has determined that the underlying cause of death was Covid-19, as opposed to other statistics which report the number of deaths of people with Covid-19 or who died within 28 days of a positive test.\nThis article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here.\nFor the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as partly false\nbecause the flu hasn’t been eradicated, though there are good reasons for why this year’s flu season is so mild.\nWe can’t sugar coat how difficult this year has been for good information.\nNews this year has fractured communities, and caused confusion and panic for many of us. No one can control what will happen next. But you can support a debate based on fair, accurate and transparent information.\nAs independent, impartial fact checkers, we rely on individuals like you to ensure the most dangerously false inaccuracies can be called out and challenged.\nCould you chip in to support an accurate and fair debate today?"}, {"claim": "The DHS released thousands of COVID-positive migrants into the United States.", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Refuted", "justification": "The answer and sources show that the migrants tested positive after being released so the claim is refuted.", "claim_date": "3-3-2021", "speaker": "Ryan Fournier", "original_claim_url": "https://twitter.com/KriskaiaD/status/1367244894570385411", "fact_checking_article": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210306170124/https://misbar.com/en/factcheck/2021/03/04/thousands-of-covid-positive-migrants-were-not-released-into-the-us", "reporting_source": "Twitter", "location_ISO_code": "US", "claim_types": ["Event/Property Claim"], "fact_checking_strategies": ["Written Evidence"], "questions": [{"question": "What migrants is the claim referring to and how many were there?", "answers": [{"answer": "More than 100 (108) illegal immigrants released by the Border Patrol into Texas since late January have tested positive for the coronavirus following their arrival, officials in a city on the U.S.-Mexico border tell Fox News.", "answer_type": "Extractive", "source_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/108-migrants-released-border-patrol-texas-positive-coronavirus", "source_medium": "Web text"}]}, {"question": "When the migrants were released was it known that they had Covid-19?", "answers": [{"answer": "After Border Patrol release, asylum-seekers test positive for Covid in Brownsville, Texas", "answer_type": "Extractive", "source_url": "http://news.yahoo.com/border-patrol-release-asylum-seekers-200829155.html", "source_medium": "Web text"}]}], "orig_claim": "The DHS released thousands of COVID-positive migrants into the United States.", "orig_verdict": "Misleading", "fulltext": "Impeach Biden Administration!

The FDA clears the path for a third vaccine, a single shot, offering new promise for hard-hit, hard-to-reach communities. But what does being vaccinated mean for your daily life?\nDR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: The risk becomes extremely low when you have both parties vaccinated.\nBASH: I will speak to Dr. Anthony Fauci next.\nAnd one step closer. President Biden's relief plan heads to the Senate without any Republican support.\nJOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have no time to waste.\nBASH: And it seems minimum wage workers won't see another penny. Is this the future of the Biden agenda? White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki and Democrats Senator Chris Coons and Congresswoman Karen Bass join me to discuss ahead.\nPlus: the party of Trump? The former president returns to the political arena hell-bent on revenge and potentially setting the stage for 2024. How far will he go to keep his MAGA grip on the GOP? I will speak to Republican Senator Bill Cassidy in moments.\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\nBASH: Hello. I'm Dana Bash in Washington, where the state of our union is seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.\nToday, there is new hope that normalcy will soon be within reach. Late Saturday, the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization to Johnson & Johnson for its single dose vaccine, giving the U.S. three effective vaccines to fight COVID-19.\nAnd the company says it could ship out nearly four million doses as early as next week and has promised 100 million doses by the end of June.\nToday, advisers to the CDC will meet to give their go-ahead and discuss priority groups, this as the Biden administration prepares to make the push for its $1.9 trillion COVID relief plan in the Senate this week, after passing the bill with zero Republican votes in the House and suffering a blow from the Senate parliamentarian on minimum wage, a key Democratic priority that will now almost certainly be left out of the final package.\nThis morning, the country is also bracing for the full return of the big lie. Former President Trump will make his first speech since leaving the White House as this nation and a new administration continues to try to move forward from what he left behind, Capitol insurrection and a pandemic that has now sprinted past half-a-million dead Americans.\nI want to begin with the breaking news on the vaccine and go straight to the nation's top infectious disease expert and President Biden's chief medical adviser on COVID-19, Dr. Anthony Fauci.\nDr. Fauci, thank you for joining me this morning.\nLet's talk about Johnson & Johnson, the third vaccine, this one single-dose. How much of an impact will this have?\nFAUCI: A significant amount, Dana. It's very good news.\nNow we have three important tools in our armamentarium of capabilities against this virus. It's a very efficacious virus, I mean, if you look at the data and see what it can do, particularly when you're looking at advanced disease. It has, across multiple countries, essentially no hospitalizations or deaths in advanced disease. That's really important.\nSo, we have three big important tools now, and we're going to hopefully utilize them as efficaciously as possible.\nBASH: So, according to Johnson & Johnson, their vaccine was 72 percent effective in preventing moderate to severe cases in the United States, lower than the 95 percent efficacy rate for Pfizer and Moderna.\nSo, what is your message to somebody who sees that and decides, you know what, I'm going to wait and get Moderna and Pfizer, and not get Johnson & Johnson?\nFAUCI: Yes, you can understand that type of a concern, but, in order to really compare vaccines, you have to compare them head to head. And these were not compared head to head.\nThe message that needs to be -- prevail, Dana, is that these are three highly efficacious vaccines. I can tell you I have been fully vaccinated with one that was available. It was the Moderna. If I were not vaccinated now, and I had a choice of getting a J&J vaccine now or waiting for another vaccine, I would take whatever vaccine would be available to me as quickly as possible, for the simple reason of what I said a moment ago.\nWe want to get as many people vaccinated as quickly and expeditiously as possible. So, this is good news, because we have another very good vaccine in the mix.\n[09:05:00]\nBASH: Researchers in New York this week identified a new COVID variant that has a mutation which could potentially weaken the effectiveness of all of the vaccines. So, how dangerous is this?\nFAUCI: We take them very seriously.\nAnd the thing that we do know from in vitro or test tube studies, as well as indirectly from the vaccine, for example, the J&J study, in other areas such as in South Africa, where there's a different type of a variant, that, when you have a variant that diminishes the capability of the vaccine, if you get a good vaccine that has a high titer of antibody, you cannot get the best possible response, but it's still within the cushion of effectiveness, which tells us, don't despair about the fact that there are variants.\nThey're there and we need to take them seriously. But, again, two ways and two tools that you have to address them, A, continue with the types of mitigations, the public health measures that we do, that we talk about all the time, Dana. I don't even need to repeat them now, you know what they are. But also to vaccinate as many people as you possibly can, because even when you have variants, the vaccines will be important in spreading -- in preventing the spread.\nYou get variants when the virus has sort of like a complete field of going wherever it wants to go because the people are vulnerable. If you prevent that by public health measures and vaccination, you will dampen the effect of these variants.\nAnd that's the reason why we keep saying, keep the public health measures up and get as many people vaccinated as you possibly can.\nBASH: I want you to listen to something CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said this week.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nDR. ROCHELLE WALENSKY, CDC DIRECTOR: Things are tenuous. Now is not the time to relax restrictions. We cannot get comfortable or give in to a false sense of security that the worst of the pandemic is behind us.\nI know people are tired, they want to get back to life, to normal, but we're not there yet.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nBASH: As you know, Dr. Fauci, many governors across the country are beginning to ease some restrictions that you were just talking about. New York is opening movie theaters. Massachusetts and North Carolina are relaxing capacity restrictions on indoor dining. Is that premature?\nFAUCI: Well, I mean, amen to what Dr. Walensky said, because, if you look at the curve, Dana, it's coming down sharply, but the last several days, it's kind of plateaued at around 70,000 new infections per day.\nLet's look at what history has taught us. If you go back and look at the various surges, whenever we hit a peak and start coming down, understandably, totally understandably, you say, well, let's pull back.\nWe're going to ultimately be pulling back, but you want to get the level of baseline infections per day very low, because, if you look at that little plateau, particularly in the arena of having variants such as we have in California and such as we have in New York, it is really risky to say it's over, we're on the way out, let's pull back, because what we can see is that we turn up.\nIt isn't hypothetical, Dana, because just look historically at the late winter, early spring of 2020, at the summer of 2020. When we started to pull back prematurely, we saw the rebound. We definitely don't want that to happen.\nBASH: So, is this premature? Are the easing of those restrictions too...\nFAUCI: Yes, I would think it is. I think we -- yes, I think, obviously, each individual state and city needs to look at the situation in their own location, where they are.\nBut, in general, to think just because the cases are coming down on a daily basis, take a look at the pattern, and just watch over the next several days to a week. If we do this and start coming up, then we're going to go right back to the road of rebounding.\nSo, that's the reason why I agree completely with what Dr. Walensky has said.\nBASH: So, let's talk about people who are vaccinated. Again, 23 million Americans are now fully vaccinated, but there is still so much uncertainty, as you know, about what they can and can't do.\nYou told me last week you don't want to get out ahead of the guidance, that more information is coming. But people are anxious, and they're confused. So, when are those -- the guidelines for how people who are vaccinated can act in their life going to come out?\nFAUCI: We have been in intensive discussions as recently as yesterday evening about this.\nThe CDC will be coming out within the next few weeks, maybe even sooner, with some guidelines about what people who are vaccinated -- and I think -- and I know you're referring, Dana, to people who are doubly vaccinated 14 days out, they're protected, they have that 94 percent to 95 percent protection. What can they do?\n[09:10:00]\nI'm very certain, and we have discussed this -- and I -- and you're right. I don't want to get ahead of the guidelines, because the CDC wants to do things that are science-based. If you can't get the science, you have got to maybe use modeling.\nAnd in addition to modeling, you use good, professional commonsense judgment. They will be coming out with that.\nBut one of the things that I think is going to become clear, that, if you have individuals, adults who are vaccinated, two people that are doubly vaccinated and are protected, then you can do things that we weren't talking about before. You can have dinner in a home without masks on.\nYou can have friends who you know are doubly vaccinated and are protected together with you. So, you can start doing things essentially in the home, in a setting where you're not out in the community, where there are 70,000 new infections per day.\nBASH: Right.\nFAUCI: And you can start doing some of the things that you weren't able to do before.\nBASH: That's very good to know.\nReal quick, I want to ask you about the school situation. I spoke this week to a superintendent, the superintendent of Fairfax County, Virginia, Public Schools. We will be showing that more of that later in the show. It's one of the bigger districts in the country.\nI want you to hear what he told me about reopening his schools.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nSCOTT BRABRAND, FAIRFAX COUNTY, VIRGINIA, SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT: It's not realistic if we're going to stay with six-foot social distancing.\nBASH: What would you need in terms of guidance for shorter social distancing to get everybody back to school?\nBRABRAND: We certainly know that, at three feet, that we could make that work in our elementary schools and probably in our middle schools.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nBASH: So, right now, as you know, the CDC recommends keeping six feet of distance, to the greatest extent possible.\nCan you clarify? If a school district like that says that, to bring everybody back, they would have to shrink it to three feet of social distancing, with other mitigation efforts as well, would that be safe?\nFAUCI: You know, I'm not going to make a judgment about that, because I don't know that specific situation, Dana.\nBut I can tell you that the CDC continually looks at things and reevaluates. One of the things that I think is important is that we have got to get the resources to the schools to be able to perhaps have the capability of having more spacing, to have better ventilation, to make sure they have the masks and all the other PPE that would make it less likely that children would get infected or that the teachers and other educational personnel would get infected.\nBASH: Dr. Fauci, we're out of time.\nI just want to say, do you think, though, that it can be less than six feet, the social distancing in schools?\nFAUCI: You know, Dana, I don't want to jump ahead of that...\nBASH: OK.\nFAUCI: ... because I need to see the specific situation. I don't want to be able to go ahead back and forth with the CDC.\nLet's take a look. The CDC continually reevaluate things according to the data.\nBASH: Understood.\nThank you, Dr. Fauci, for this and everything else. Appreciate it.\nFAUCI: Thank you.\nBASH: And I want to go now to -- thank you.\nI want to go now to the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki.\nThank you for joining me this morning.\nJEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Great to be here.\nBASH: So, President Biden's sweeping -- his sweeping $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package is now in the Senate, as you know.\nA cornerstone of this campaign that he ran, his presidential campaign, was bipartisan cooperation. He called it a mandate from the American people. He got zero Republican votes in the House. It looks like he may get zero in the Senate.\nCan you point to one concession that President Biden is making to this package to try to win Republican support?\nPSAKI: Well, first I can say, Dana, I think there have been more Republicans in the House and Senate sitting in the Oval Office over the last month, having a discussion, having a debate at times with the president about what they want to see in this package, what we can work together on, than perhaps over the last four years.\nThe president has been open to hearing good ideas, hearing good ideas from Republicans and Democrats on how to make it better. And at this point in time, though, what this proposal is going to address is how we're going to help people bridge through this period of time, get them direct checks, reopen schools, get more vaccines in the arms of Americans.\nWe have not seen a substantive, big proposal in response back from Republicans. This is the scope of the problem and the scope of the kind of package that needs -- we need to pass to address that.\nBASH: So, he's definitely had discussions with Republicans, but -- and he's heard their concerns. So, is he open to actually acting on that and changing his proposal, changing the legislation to address those concerns?\nPSAKI: He's been open from the beginning.\nThere's been more targeting of the direct checks. He has not been willing to negotiate on the size of the checks, but there has been a targeting to ensure that it hits the Americans who need that help the most. That's an idea that has come up in meetings with Democrats and Republicans.\nAnd he's certainly open to hearing from their ideas.\nWhat he will not do, though, is make this a Washington, political, partisan issue and prevent the American people from getting the relief they need.\nBASH: So, this bill could change?\n[09:15:00]\nPSAKI: Seventy percent of the public wants this bill to pass.\nWell, it's going through the Senate process. As you know, this is democracy in action. We know that the bill will look different on the way out, as it did when he presented it in his prime-time address.\nBut we -- there is an urgency here, Dana, as you know, because, by the middle of March, 11 million Americans will lose unemployment insurance. So, we need to move quickly and rapidly to get this relief out to the American public.\nBASH: Well, it's definitely going to look different in the Senate with one way that we know, which is that the $15 minimum wage increase will not be in there. According to the Senate parliamentarian, it shouldn't fit into this package.\nSo, because of that, can you promise Americans that President Biden will raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by the end of his first term?\nPSAKI: Well, he can't do it on his own, but he is absolutely committed to raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.\nHe thinks it's long overdue. He believes that men and women who are working hard, trying to make ends meet, should have -- should not be living at the poverty level. And we're going to spend the next few days and weeks looking for the best path forward, working with Democrats and Republicans, hopefully, to do exactly that.\nBASH: Let's turn to foreign policy.\na U.S. intelligence report declassified on Friday says that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was responsible for approving the operation that killed journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\nI want you to listen to what then candidate Joe Biden said on the debate stage about this.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nQUESTION: President Trump has not punished senior Saudi leaders. Would you?\nBIDEN: Yes. I would make it very clear we were not going to, in fact, sell more weapons to them. We were going to, in fact, make them pay the price and make them, in fact, the pariah that they are. They have to be held accountable.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nBASH: Candidate Biden, you heard there, said he would hold Saudi Arabia accountable.\nNow that he's president, he's imposed no travel ban, no asset freeze, no criminal charges, and, most importantly, no sanctions directly on the crown prince himself. Why not?\nPSAKI: Well, first, Dana, from the first day of the administration, we have been crystal clear at every level, from the president on down, we are going to recalibrate this relationship and turn the page from the last four years.\nAnd that means ending our support for the war in Yemen, doing more to address the humanitarian crisis, and ensuring that we are holding to account the actions, the human rights abuses of this government, by word and by action.\nThe release of this report, which was held back over the last four years, is part of that, making that clear to the public. But we have also taken a number of steps through the Treasury Department, through the State Department to sanction the deputy head of intelligence, to sanction their revolutionary forces in Saudi Arabia, and to make clear that we will never let this happen again.\nAnd that's a message we have clearly sent over the last few days.\nBASH: OK. So, but you're talking about the people who are under the crown prince, and they are being punished. So, isn't punishing them like punishing the hit man and not the mob boss who actually put out the hit? PSAKI: Well, first, Dana, historically, and even in recent history,\nDemocratic and Republican administrations, there have not been sanctions put in place for the leaders of foreign governments where we have diplomatic relations and even where we don't have diplomatic relations.\nAnd we believe there is more effective ways to make sure this doesn't happen again and to also be able to leave room to work with the Saudis on areas where there is mutual agreement, where there is interests, national interests, for the United States.\nThat is what diplomacy looks like. That is what the complicated global engagement looks like.\nBASH: Jen...\nPSAKI: And we have made no secret and been clear we're going to hold them accountable on the global stage and with direct actions.\nBASH: Yes, I hear you, but I -- you say hold them accountable, and it just doesn't look like that when it comes to the notion of justice.\nAnd the question is, do you feel like justice has really been done when it comes specifically to the crown prince and his role in the brutal murder of a journalist, because the journalist was working on stories that were challenging him?\nPSAKI: Well, this is a horrific crime, and the president has said that himself. I will reiterate that here today.\nOne of the reasons the State Department put in place what we're calling the Khashoggi rule is because we believe that anyone who threatens journalists, who threatens dissidents should be held to account and shouldn't -- and should have their -- potentially have their travel visas revoked. That's a global issue and one we took action on, on Friday.\nAt the same time, Dana, it needs to be clear that our relationship with Saudi Arabia is one that is in the interest of the United States to maintain, while still being clear it will be recalibrated. We are going to hold them accountable for human rights abuses, and we're going to take actions, including the actions announced by the State Department and the Treasury Department on Friday.\nBASH: I hear a lot of things that sound like the Biden administration is showing the Saudis in general some outrage and some consequences, but not specifically for the crown prince.\n[09:20:15]\nAnd there are a lot of questions we can continue to ask about that, including President Biden promising that America is back and the question of whether or not the world will see that America is back if somebody who directs the brutal murder of a journalist is not specifically held accountable.\nBut we have a lot of things to get to, Jen.\nAnd one of the things is, \"The New York Times\" is reporting last night that a second allegation of sexual harassment against New York Governor Chris (sic) Cuomo. This is a report from a former aide, Charlotte Bennett, saying that Cuomo asked her alone in his office last spring about her sex life, including whether she ever had sex with older men. She has other allegations as well.\nGovernor Cuomo says he never made advances toward Ms. Bennett. But does President Biden believe Governor Cuomo or Charlotte Bennett?\nPSAKI: Well, first, President Biden has been consistent that he believes that every woman should be heard, should be treated with respect and with dignity.\nCharlotte should be treated with respect and dignity. So should Lindsey. And there should be an independent review looking into these allegations. And that's certainly something he supports and we believe should move forward as quickly as possible.\nBASH: Governor Andrew Cuomo, I should say, obviously.\nPresident Biden told reporters in 2018 -- quote -- \"For a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus nationally, you have got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she is talking about is real.\"\nSo, does President Biden still believe what candidate Biden said, that the essence of these allegations are real?\nPSAKI: Of course, Dana, he believes -- that's why I said he believes that every woman who comes forward should be treated with dignity and respect. They should be able to tell their story. There should be an independent review of these allegations.\nThey're serious. It was hard to read that story, as a woman. And that process should move forward as quickly as possible. And that's something we all support and the president supports.\nBASH: Jen Psaki, White House press secretary, thank you so much for your time this morning. Appreciate it.\nPSAKI: Thank you, Dana. Pleasure to be here.\nBASH: And CPAC or TPAC?\nPresident Trump set to headline the big weekend for conservatives, as many GOP faithful and some leaders make clear they just can't quit him.\nRepublican Senator Bill Cassidy, who voted to convict Trump, is next to talk about the future of his party.\nAnd we go to one of the largest school districts in the country preparing for some students to return for the first time in nearly a year. Is President Biden's hope to have most kids back in his first 100 days in line with reality?\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n[09:27:15]\nBASH: Welcome back to STATE OF THE UNION. I'm Dana Bash.\nIn just a few hours, Donald Trump will take the stage at what's basically become his own personal MAGA version of Burning Man, the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, which has so far featured a golden icon of the former president and many masks protecting chins, as speakers try to keep the big lie alive.\nJoining me is one of seven Republicans who voted to convict former President Trump and push back against the big lie, Senator and Dr. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.\nSenator, thank you so much for joining me.\nSo, President Trump is speaking at CPAC this afternoon amid a debate in your party about its future. So, I'm sure you have heard Congresswoman Liz Cheney say President Trump should not have a role in the Republican Party moving forward.\nWhat do you think?\nSEN. BILL CASSIDY (R-LA): You had a lot in that question.\nLet me put it this way. We have got to win in two years, we have got to win in four years. If we do that, we will do that by speaking to those issues that are important to the American people. And there's a lot of issues important to them right now, not by putting one person on a pedestal and making that one person our focal point.\nIf we do that, if we speak to those issues, to those families, to those individuals, we win. That's where our focus should be.\nBASH: Well, it doesn't sound like the former president's influence is diminishing. You talked about putting him on a pedestal.\nHe was literally -- his face was in bronze at this CPAC event that's going on. Top Republicans are flying down to Mar-a-Lago to meet with him. My understanding is that the essence of his speech will be that he's not going anywhere.\nSo, can the GOP move forward in the direction you were just talking about with Trump still very much in the spotlight?\nCASSIDY: First, CPAC is not the entirety of the Republican Party. That's number one.\nNumber two, political organizations and campaigns are about winning. Over the last four years, we lost the House of Representatives, the Senate and the presidency. No president -- that has not happened in a single four years under a president since Herbert Hoover. Now, if we plan to win in 2022 and 2024, we have to listen to the\nvoters, not just those who really like President Trump, but also those who perhaps are less sure. If we do, if we speak to the voters who are less sure who went from President Trump to President Biden, we win.\nIf we don't, we lose. That is a reality that we have to confront.\nBASH: Can you just clarify that? Are you saying that the party should try to sideline or ignore the former president in order to achieve what you just described? Is he at fault for losing -- obviously, he's at fault for losing the White House, but Congress too?\n(CROSSTALK)\n[09:30:05]\nCASSIDY: If you're going to win in 2022 and 2024, you have got to speak to voters who didn't vote for us last time.\nNow, our policies are great. Before the COVID crisis hit, we had record employment for every group, Hispanics, African-Americans, women, the disabled, high school dropouts, veterans, you name it. We had economic policies that were working.\nSo, if that's the case, and we can speak to those policies, to those families, then we will win. But if we idolize one person, we will lose. And that's kind of clear from the last election.\nBASH: OK. I want to get to COVID relief.\nOne more question on this. Your leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, said this week that he would support former President Trump if he wins the nomination in 2024.\nYou are one of those who voted to convict him. But looking ahead, do you think Donald Trump is fit to be president again?\nCASSIDY: I don't think Donald Trump -- one, he will be 78 years old, but I don't think he will be our nominee, for the reasons I have said.\nOver the last four years, we have lost the House, the Senate and the presidency. Political campaigns are about winning. Our agenda does not move forward unless we win. We need a candidate who cannot only win himself or herself, but we also have to have someone who lifts all boats.\nAnd that's clearly not happened over the last four years.\nBASH: Is he fit to be president?\nCASSIDY: So, I -- that's a theoretical that I don't think will come to pass.\nI'm sorry?\nBASH: Is he fit to be president again? CASSIDY: You're asking me a question for four years from now, which,\nagain, I don't mean to duck...\nBASH: Yes.\nCASSIDY: ... but you could ask a lot of people if they're fit.\nThe point is, I don't think he is going to be our nominee, for the reasons I just described.\nBASH: Let's turn to coronavirus relief.\nThe House just passed a $1.9 trillion package. I know you think it is too much money. There is a lot in here, though, that you do support, direct payments to Americans, money for vaccinations.\nIt appears it won't include a $15 minimum wage hike, which you opposed. Are you open to voting yes on that plan?\nCASSIDY: I have no clue how it will come out of the Senate. Republicans have not been involved.\nI listened to Press Secretary Jen Psaki speaking about how we have been listened to. I started laughing.\n(LAUGHTER)\nCASSIDY: That is such a joke. You can find one thing perhaps where, oh, gosh, we will get criticized on that, so we will adapt.\nBut the reality is, is that they put forward a package which reflects the interests of the Democratic constituencies that elected the president. Yes, it has things for broader Americans, but much of it is only for those.\nI can give you the examples, $112 million for the San Francisco transit system. Where did that come from? And so reality is, is that we have something which addresses concerns that Republicans and all Americans have, but disproportionately benefits those of one party.\nWe started off in it together. It ends up being that, yes, but we're going to take some off the top for our folks. That's not a way to proceed. I'm sorry this is the direction they're going.\nBASH: You said it's a joke that President Biden is listening to you, but you were one of 10 Republican senators who met with President Biden in the White House.\nHas the president or anybody in the White House given you any indication at all that they're open to any negotiations?\nCASSIDY: No.\nAnd, as you may recall, it was reported afterwards that, as President Biden would be speaking to us, his staff would be in the background shaking their head no, as a signal to him as to, no, don't concede on this point.\nSo, that's too bad.\nWe have had five different COVID relief packages which passed overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis, all five when President Trump was president and Republicans controlled the Senate. We have demonstrated that we can come together in a way in which the interests of all Americans are represented, and you come up with a better package than if you only have one party's interests represented.\nMy fear, this becomes a Trojan horse for things which actually injure our country. Left-of-center economists, Democratic economists like Larry Summers have pointed to the danger that this will ignite inflation. Igniting inflation, which hurts middle -income families, working-class families, chewing up their savings, this can be the Trojan horse that destroys the future for families.\nBut it sneaks in because it gives these initial benefits. That's my concern. It would have been better had they actually listened to us in fact, as opposed to merely in rhetoric.\nBASH: So, as the president was talking to you in that White House meeting, and you saw the staff, as you report, shaking their heads no, is your -- was your sense that he was interested in making a deal, but he's being pushed not to?\nCASSIDY: You know, I can't speak of their internal dynamics.\nOf course, the president presented himself as he did in his inaugural address. Yes, he was open to unity and bipartisanship. That has not been this legislation. There has not been any significant input from Republicans, beyond, hey, do you really want to give stimulus checks to people making $290,000 a year?\n[09:35:15]\nNow they have cut it to $200,000 a year. Is that the sort of focus American people would want? I think they would like a little bit more focus.\nSo, the president so far has been about rhetoric. And, by the way, we can work together. I have -- another big issue facing our country is privacy. I just introduced a bipartisan bill with Jacky Rosen from Nevada, Democrat, to address privacy issues related to smartwatches.\nRepublicans remain willing and are working on issues that require bipartisan cooperation. We have done five on a COVID relief package in the past. It could have happened here. They made a conscious decision not to include us.\nBASH: Senator Bill Cassidy, thank you.\nAnd I look forward to talking to you more about those bipartisan issues that you clearly want to talk about and you want to get done across the aisle, separate and apart from this bill.\nAppreciate you coming on this morning.\nCASSIDY: Thank you, Dana.\nBASH: And I want to now turn to one of President Biden's closest supporters in the Senate, Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, also a member of the Foreign Relations Committee.\nYou just heard your colleague across the aisle talking about the fact that he doesn't feel like Joe Biden and the White House is really negotiating in earnest with them. I want to talk about that in a second, but start by asking you specifically about the push to increase the minimum wage inside that package.\nThe $15 minimum wage was included in the House bill. The Senate parliamentarian says it doesn't work as part of the COVID bill. So, as an alternative, Senators Bernie Sanders and Ron Wyden are pushing proposals that would penalize companies that pay their employees less than $15 an hour.\nIs that something that you support?\nSEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Well, Dana, I haven't seen the details of that proposal yet.\nAnd if I'm someone who is always willing to negotiate with Republicans, I'm willing to negotiate with Democrats as well. Let's start with what we all agree on, that the federal minimum wage of $7.25 is too low. It has to be raised. Every Democrat and many Republicans agree with that.\nPresident Biden has called us to raise it to $15 an hour. Senator Sanders' bill would have done that over four years to 2025. We haven't seen this new proposal. This isn't the last bill we will adopt this year. There may be several other chances for us to move a minimum wage bill. But I look forward to hearing from Senators Sanders and Wyden this week.\nBASH: Let's talk about what you just heard from Senator Bill Cassidy, that it's a joke that the White House has actually reached out in earnest to Republicans to negotiate on this COVID relief bill.\nWhat's your response to that?\nCOONS: Well, as you know, there were 10 Republican senators who were the first senators to sit down in the Oval Office with President Biden.\nThis bill has the support not just of 76 percent of all Americans, but 60 percent of all Republicans in recent polling. So, as Senator Cassidy said, we should listen to our voters.\nAnd the majority of the American people, the overwhelming majority of the American people and of both parties, are urging us to act. President Biden is someone who will work across the aisle. I was encouraged to hear Senator Cassidy say, regardless of the outcome of this stimulus bill, this COVID response bill, he is going to work across the aisle.\nI have been a good friend and partner with him working on national service issues, for example. So, I think President Biden challenged us to do two things, to deliver relief to the American people to this ongoing pandemic and the recession caused by it, and to find ways to work across the aisle.\nThe urgency of this issue means that he's moving ahead and we're moving ahead with this $1.9 trillion bill that has broad support amongst voters of all backgrounds and parties.\nBASH: I hear you on that. And talking is big, because there hasn't been enough of that in this town. But talking is one thing and actually making concessions and doing deals on something like this is a different thing.\nAnd he's saying there was no real effort on that. That's fair, don't you think?\nCOONS: What is fair is that President Biden and the Democrats in Congress gave several weeks for there to be a serious negotiation that came close to the scope and range of this challenge.\nThe proposals that came forward weren't anything like the scale of the challenge.\nBASH: So...\nCOONS: And so, frankly, we're moving ahead with a bill that probably will get no Republican votes in the Senate, but will have broad Republican support in the country.\nMy hope is that, after we pass this bill, we will then move towards bipartisan legislating on a whole range of other issues, whether it's immigration or criminal justice reform or national service or other topics that you know well, Dana, I have worked hard across the aisle on in the last Congress and intend to in this Congress.\n[09:40:11]\nBASH: Last summer, you told Politico -- quote -- \"I will not stand idly by for four years and watch the Biden administration's initiatives blocked at every turn.\"\nProgressives say that's exactly what's happening with the minimum wage increase. How do you respond to that?\nCOONS: Well, this is the first major bill to come through Congress during the Biden administration.\nI am certain that President Biden is committed to raising the minimum wage, to raising it to $15 an hour. We will see what proposal Senator Sanders has this week. But I don't think we should throw up the white flag and say, well, there's no way that we can work with Republicans, when this is literally the first major piece of legislation to come through. We will have other chances to pass bold legislation in this Congress,\nin this year, but we have to give bipartisanship a chance.\nBASH: I want to turn to foreign policy and the White House report that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved the operation that killed journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\nDespite that conclusion, President Biden is not directly punishing him. In 2018, Senator, you introduced a resolution to hold the crown prince personally accountable and said at the time that failure to do so would -- quote -- \"profoundly weaken our country.\"\nSo, does Biden's failure to hold the crown prince accountable weaken America?\nCOONS: From his first day as president, President Biden and his foreign policy team have been working to recalibrate our relationship with the Saudi kingdom.\nI was one of a group of senators who pressed for the release of the director of national intelligence office report on Khashoggi's responsibility, on the responsibility of MBS for the murder of Khashoggi to be released.\nPresident Trump refused to do that. Republicans in the Senate refused to press him successfully to do that.\nBASH: Right.\nCOONS: President Biden has now done that. And he's imposed a new rule, a new visa sanction against 76 Saudis, some senior Saudis, because of their role...\nBASH: But...\nCOONS: ... and set a new standard for those who would go after dissidents and journalists around the world.\nBASH: But the Coons standard in 2018 was that the crown prince specifically needs to be held to justice. Is he getting away with murder now?\nCOONS: We are not yet done with recalibrating the relationship between the United States and the Saudi kingdom. And I respect the way that President Biden has elevated human rights.\nPresident Trump was someone who, frankly, put arms deals and their willingness to work with us to confront a dangerous regime in Iran far ahead of any human rights concerns. And I am optimistic that our role in terms of the war in Yemen, the accountability here for Khashoggi's murder and other ways in which the U.S./Saudi relationship may change will in fact deliver the accountability that I called for.\nBut I also recognize the reality that the crown prince is largely in control of the Saudi kingdom and may well be so for decades. This is a critical relationship. Balancing human rights and our regional interests and security is part of the hard work of diplomacy.\nBut I think President Biden and his senior team have already taken bolder steps than ever were seen in the last four years.\nBASH: So, you're comfortable with where they are now? You don't think that the crown prince should be punished specifically and directly?\nCOONS: I look forward to having ongoing conversations with the administration about this issue, as the U.S./Saudi relationship is recalibrated.\nBASH: Senator Chris Coons, thank you so much for joining me this morning. I appreciate it.\nCOONS: Thank you, Dana.\nBASH: And it is near the top of the priority list for Democrats, reforming the nation's policing systems, but even with total control in Washington, Democrats have an uphill climb to get it done.\nCongresswoman Karen Bass, a leader on this issue, joins me next.\nAnd even one of the wealthiest school systems isn't ready for full return to classrooms. Their message to President Biden and what lunchtime and recess looks like for students who will come back.\nThat's next.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n[09:48:50]\nBASH: This week, the House could vote on a police reform bill named in honor of George Floyd.\nHis death and the video of a white officer kneeling on his neck for more than eight minutes led to protests around the country and around the world, demanding an end to systemic racism and police brutality.\nBut despite Democratic majorities in Congress, this is hardly a slam dunk.\nJoining me now, Democratic Congresswoman Karen Bass of California.\nThank you so much for joining me this morning.\nYou have reintroduced your police reform bill named after George Floyd, as I said. And it could be voted on this week. There are some moderate Democrats, though, who want change in this bill. And the big change that they're talking about is the part that ends legal immunity for police officers accused of misconduct.\nIs that something you are willing to compromise on in order to get the votes you need to pass this?\nREP. KAREN BASS (D-CA): Well, what we plan on doing this week is passing it out of the House. And, certainly, when it goes over to the Senate, it is going to take 60 votes.\nAnd we will absolutely be sitting down and talking, both Democrats and Republicans, in the House and in the Senate. I have had conversations with Senator Tim Scott and, of course, Senator Cory Booker. And I think the stage is set for real reform to hit the president's desk.\n[09:50:08]\nBASH: You're confident, though, that you will get enough votes in the House, as is?\nBASS: I am confident that we will get enough votes in the House.\nBeen having many discussions with people. And, of course, my colleagues are concerned, because they were all hit very hard in the elections in November.\nBut since George Floyd's murder, over 100 people have been murdered or brutalized by police. And the person that -- the officer that killed George Floyd is going to go on trial soon. There was just a decision the other day out of Rochester, New York, where charges won't be filed against the officers that killed the individual up there.\nAnd, clearly, we have to do something that holds police officers accountable. Qualified immunity and lowering the standard for prosecution are two of the most effective ways to do this.\nAnd other states have taken the lead. I spoke yesterday to Governor Polis from Colorado. And they have already taken the lead on reforming qualified immunity. So, it can be done. There won't be the dramatic departure of police officers around the country if we hold police officers accountable.\nBASH: Congresswoman, after the Capitol attack, you criticized the police response and said -- quote -- \"If that had been a protest over police brutality...\"\nBASS: Yes.\nBASH: ... \"with a large number of African-Americans,\" you said that you believe blood would have been flowing down the halls of the Capitol.\nI want you to listen to what acting Capitol Police chief said this week about that very issue.\nBASS: Sure.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nYOGANANDA PITTMAN, ACTING U.S. CAPITOL POLICE CHIEF: I have no evidence whatsoever that suggests that there was any discrepancy based on our security posture and as it relates to making enhancements or not based upon race.\n(END VIDEO CLIP) BASH: Are you satisfied with that answer?\nBASS: No.\nAnd, I mean, personally I still believe, as I said in that quote before, if there were 10,000 protesters with Black Lives Matter, African-Americans, Latinos, et cetera, who were marching on the Capitol, I have no doubt that the response would have been completely different.\nBASH: I want to talk about the COVID relief, and specifically the question about vaccines.\n(CROSSTALK)\nBASH: Until January, you were the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.\nThere is new data from Kaiser that came out last week showing that white Americans are getting vaccinated at double the pace of black Americans, triple the pace of Hispanic Americans. Do you think systemic racism is playing a role in vaccine distribution?\nBASS: Yes, well, I do.\nBut, when we say that, it doesn't mean that people are deliberately withholding vaccines. The greatest problem is access. Now, there is vaccine hesitancy. But the access, I believe, is the number one problem. And we just finished a survey with the Congressional Black Caucus, Hispanic caucus, Native Americans, and Asians.\nWe reached out to researchers, ethnic researchers. They just completed a survey. And amongst African-Americans, the majority said that their hesitancy was because they think the vaccine has been rushed. But many, many, many other people said they would be willing to get the vaccine.\nSo, if you focus on access, and people are vaccinated, you're talking about friends and family members who will see others vaccinated and see that everything is fine. And so we have access as a serious problem, even in Los Angeles, because people are having difficulties getting online.\nAnd then individuals from other parts of the community who are white are coming into inner-city areas they probably have never been in before seeking vaccines.\nBASH: So, real quick, Dr. Fauci has said that he doesn't think the vaccine rollout is failing African-Americans. Is he wrong?\nBASS: He doesn't feel it's what?\nBASH: It's -- he doesn't think that the vaccine rollout is failing African-Americans.\nBASS: Well, I mean, there are problems. And there are problems because of access, because the way you access the vaccine is online. And so it is failing African-Americans. And what I believe we need to do is, we need to move and expand beyond online registration.\nThere needs to be community registration. There needs to be mobile sites. There is a city councilman in Los Angeles, Marqueece Harris- Dawson. He does phone banking in a specific neighborhood, so only those people in the neighborhood know when and where to show up for the vaccine, and he is having no problem vaccinating African- Americans.\nBASH: Before I let you go, real quick, in your home state, the governor, Gavin Newsom, is facing a well-financed recall effort over his handling of the coronavirus there.\nHow real of a threat do you think this recall is?\n[09:55:00]\nBASS: Well, I do think that it's a threat.\nI think it's very sad. I think it's inappropriate. He does not deserve to be recalled. I believe that he has done the best he could. He's having very -- he's having difficult in the state because you have places in our state where people are COVID deniers.\nAnd so the -- I am hoping that the recall does not qualify. And if it does, we will do everything we can to defeat it.\nBASH: Congresswoman Karen Bass, thank you so much.

A huge surprise unfolded as President Ram Nath Kovind officially inaugurated the venue as 'Narendra Modi Stadium'. It was, however, later clarified that the stadium was renamed from Motera to 'Narendra Modi Stadium' while the name of the entire complex still remains Sardar Patel Stadium.\n\"This stadium is owned by the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) and it was always known as the Motera Stadium. So there is no question of renaming it now. It was Narendra Modi, who had first floated the idea to demolish the old stadium and build a new one when he was the GCA president,\" said Nitin Patel, according to a video posted by the Press Information Bureau (PIB).\nThe Narendra Modi Stadium is a part of the Sardar Patel Complex, clarified Patel after criticism from political rivals.\nSports Minister Kiren Rijiju also defended the decision to rename the stadium.\n“The name of the whole Sports Complex is Sardar Patel Sports Enclave. Only the name of one Cricket Stadium, within that complex has been named as #NarendramodiStadium,” Rijiju said.\n“Ironically, “The Parivaar”, which never respected Sardar Patel, even after his death, is now making hue & cry!,” said Rijiju following criticism by opposition leader Rahul Gandhi.\n“In 2007, Smt Sonia Gandhi came to Arunachal Pradesh and changed beautiful Arunachal University as Rajiv Gandhi University, laid foundation for Rajiv Gandhi Polytechnic, after having Indira Gandhi Park, Rajiv Gandhi Stadium, Nehru Museum, Jawahar Nehru College, list is endless…,” he wrote in a series of tweets.\nOn the sporting grounds, the start to the life at the stadium has been a pleasant one for the Indian cricket team. Virat Kohli & Co. are in the driving seat against England, having restricted the visitors to just 112 runs in the first innings.

Thank you not only for what you do for the -- the credit you give me that I really don't deserve. This is -- this is a case of life and death. We're talking about people's lives. I want you to know that once we beat COVID, we're going to do everything we can to end cancer as we know it. I've asked Dr. Eric Lander, a renowned Harvard/MIT scientist, to co-lead the Presidential Council of Advisors in Science and Technology, and the Office of Science and Technology Policy. These are the White House offices that bring together the country's top scientists and address our most pressing needs. They'll be part of the administration's work to develop a DARPA-like advanced research effort on cancer and other diseases, just like there is DARPA in the Defense Department that develops the breakthroughs to protect our country. This administration is going to be guided by science -- to save lives and to make lives better. And that's why I wanted to come here, Albert, to thank you and to thank all the workers here in Kalamazoo. And I'm here to thank my good friend, Governor Whitmer, and she has become a good and close friend. The Governor have been on the frontlines of this pandemic, as well, for a long time, and I think she's doing an incredible job in a very difficult circumstances. And Michigan is also fortunate to have my buddy Gary Peters as United States senator, and Debbie Stabenow. Gary is here. Gary has been a workhorse in making sure that we move through this funding to get things done, because he understands better than anyone: It's about urgency -- the urgency of the moment. So, Gary -- thank you, Senator. Thank you for all you're doing. Last week, I toured the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. I met world-class doctors, scientists, and researchers who were critical for discovering the vaccines in record time. I remember when we first started talking about this, asking Dr. Fauci and others. They said, \"Well, it could take up to several years, maybe as many as six or eight years, to find -- find a vaccine.\" It's a miracle of science and the brilliant minds that we have around us. And now it's a second miracle -- a miracle of manufacturing -- to produce hundreds of millions of doses. Let me say that again: hundreds of millions of doses. I came here because I want the American people to understand the extraordinary -- extraordinary work that's being done to undertake the most difficult operational challenge this nation has ever faced. And let me say parenthetically that it's not enough that we find cures for Americans. There needs to be cures that the world is able to take part of, because you can't build a wall or a fence high enough to keep a pandemic out. On our tour, I met a few of your nearly 3,000 workers, Albert: experts managing ingredients that come in from different cities and states; experts handling 3D modeling and artificial intelligence to ensure that every dose is properly crafted; experts ensuring an environ- -- a sterile environment so that each vial -- each and every one -- is safe and free of contaminants. All of this is followed by extensive safety and quality control inspection, then careful packaging and labeling. We walked by a freezer farm that then keeps those doses viable so they can be shipped. This is an incredibly complex process. And at every stop, safety is the utmost priority. The whole process takes teamwork, precision, and around-the-clock focus. Machinists operating some of the most advanced equipment in the world, working side by side with chemists, biologists, pioneering technologies that, less than a year ago, were little more than theories and aspirations. And it takes a partnership, in our view, between the federal government and all of the companies and universities contributing to the vaccine effort. Just over four weeks ago, America had no real plan to vaccinate most of the country. My predecessor -- as my mother would say, \"God love him\" -- failed to order enough vaccines, failed to mobilize the effort to administer the shots, failed to set up vaccine centers. That changed the moment we took office. I directed Jeff Zients, my COVID-19 Response Coordinator, to lead my administration's work with the vaccine manufacturers to buy more vaccines and to speed up delivery. Albert referenced it earlier, and I want to thank him for making it happen. Because we worked together, we're now on track to have enough vaccine supply for all Americans by the end of July. And it doesn't mean that it'll be in all Americans' arms, but enough vaccine will be available by that time. These orders allow facilities like this one to plan ahead, accelerate their production schedules. Here's what else we did: When we discovered that vaccine manufacturers weren't being prioritized when it came to scrutinizing and securing supplies they needed, we fixed that problem and got them what they needed. We also used the Defense Production Act to speed up the supply chain for que- -- for key equipment, like fill pumps and filters, which has already helped increase vaccine production. In fact, on our tier -- on our tour today, they showed me a critical piece of machinery they didn't have before; now, they do. And it's allowing them to ramp up production. And as we increase supply, we're carrying out a clear plan to get shots into the arms of 300 million Americans or more. And I know people want confidence that it's safe. Well, I just toured, and that's -- where it's being made. It takes more time to do the check for safety than it does to actually make the vaccine. That's how fastidious they are. And listen to Dr. Fauci. Dr. Fauci assured me the COVID-9 vact- -- vaccines were safe. That's why, several weeks ago, I went through the rigorous scientific review. That's why I took my vaccine shot publicly to demonstrate to the American people that I know and believe it's safe. That's why Vice President Harris also received her shot publicly. We all know there is some history -- there's some hesitancy about taking this vaccine. We all know there's a history in this country of having subjected certain communities to terrible medical abuses in the past. But if there's one message to cut through to everyone in this country, it's this: The vaccines are safe. Please, for yourself, your family, your community, this country, take the vaccine when it's your turn and available. That's how to beat this pandemic. And we're making progress. We deployed more vaccinators, the people who put the vaccine in your arm. We're now making it possible for retired doctors and nurses to come back and, under the law, administer these shots. We've put new vaccinators in the field. These include over 800 medical personnel from our Commissioned Corps at the Department of Health and Human Services, and personnel from the Federal Emergency Management Agency -- FEMA -- the Defense Department, the National Guard. We're literally lining up -- we're lining up thousands of vaccinators, because it's one thing to have the vaccine, and it's very different to get it in someone's arms. We're also creating more places for people to get vaccinated. We've provided $3 billion to states, territories, and tribes to create hundreds of new vaccination centers to ramp -- and ramp up the existing ones that now -- that are there. Right here in Michigan, with Governor Whitmer, FEMA has provided tens of millions of dollars to bolster the state's community vaccination centers, from the National Guard at the Expo Center here in Kalamazoo, to the TF- -- excuse me, the TCF Center in Detroit, to parking lots and churches across the state. We've worked with governors in California, Texas, New York, and more to come, to stand up massive -- mass vaccine sites in stadiums that will be open 24/7, and arenas and community centers. It's an effort that's on top of the federal government covering the full cost for the states' use of their National Guards for pandemic efforts. And you suggested I do that a while ago, and I promised you I'd do it, and we did it. We also started shipping vaccines directly to thousands of local pharmacies across the country so eligible folks can get the COVID-19 shot like they would a flu shot. Here in Michigan, that's already more than 220 pharmacies, like Rite Aid and Meijers, in more than 130 Michigan cities. And that's just the beginning. It's only been four weeks. And for folks who aren't near a pharmacy or a mass vaccination center, we're deploying mobile clinics. These are special vehicles and pop-up clinics that meet folks where they live -- folks who don't have access to transportation to get the shots. We're also supplying vaccines to community health centers -- federal community health centers -- to reach those who are hit the hardest: black, Latinos, Native Americans, and rural communities, which have higher rates of COVID infections and deaths than any other group. Here in Michigan, we're already partnering with community health centers, serving more than 370,000 patients in 11 cities across the state. That's because you guys have pointed out where they were and why it was so important, and how we get to -- as Gary talks about, get to the people most in need and the people most dying from COVID. This is important to ensure everyone is treated equally and those hardest hit get the care they deserve. We're now at a point where we've seen the average daily number of people vaccinated nearly double, from the week before I took office, to about 1.7 million average per day getting a shot. We're on track to surpass my commitment. You may remember when I said, \"In my first 100 days,\" just before I was inaugurated -- which seemed like 100 days. But anyway, \"The first 100 days,\" before I was inaugurated, \"that we'd administer 100 million shots in my first 100 days.\" But we're on the path to do that. We're averaging 1.7 million a day. Soon we'll be at 50 million, and I'm confident we'll exceed the number. But that's just the floor. We have to keep going. But despite the progress, we're still in the teeth of a pandemic. New strains are emerging. In a few days, we'll cross 500,000 Americans who will have died from COVID-19. Five hundred thousand. That is almost 70,000 more than all the Americans who died in World War Two, over a four-year period. All the sorrow, all the heartache, all the pain. And while we wait for everyone to get vaccinated, we still need you to wash your hands, stay socially distanced, and mask up to help save lives. That's why, with the authority I have as President, I signed an executive order -- the only authority I have to require this -- to require masking on all federal property, all modes of travel like planes, trains, and buses. And we've been calling on governors and mayors and local officials -- Republicans and Democrats -– to institute mask mandates within their jurisdictions, just like Governor Whitmer has done here in Michigan. Look, I know it's inconvenient, but you're making a difference when you do it. Everything we do matters. We need everyone to do their part for themselves, for their loved ones, and, yes, for your country. It's a patriotic duty. We need Congress to pass my American Rescue Plan that deals with the immediate crisis -- the urgency. Now, critics say my plan is too big, that it costs $1.9 trillion. So that's too much. Well, let me ask them: What would they have me cut? What would they have me leave out? Should we not invest $20 billion to vaccinate the nation? Should we not invest $290 million to extend unemployment insurance for the 11 million Americans who are unemployed so they can get by while they get back to work? Should we not invest $50 billion to help small businesses stay open, when tens of thousands have had to close permanently? Should we not invest -- and, by the way, they make up half the employment in America. Should we not invest $130 million to help schools across the nation open safely? Right now, 24 million adults, 11 million children don't have enough food to eat. And unless you think I'm exaggerating, think of those scenes you've seen on the television with cars lined up, which seemed like miles, to wait to have someone put a box of food in their trunk. People never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever thought they would need help, and through no fault of their own, they're in that circumstance. If we don't pass the American Rescue Plan, 40 million Americans will lose nutritional assistance through a program we call SNAP, the old food stamp program. Do we not invest $3 million -- $3 billion to keep families from going hungry? One in five Americans are behind in their rent. One in ten are being in their mortgages. How many people do you know that will go to bed tonight staring at the ceiling, saying, \"God, what is going to happen if I don't get my job, if I don't have my unemployment check? What's happened to me? I'm losing my health insurance. What do I do?\" This is the United States of America, for God's sake. We invest in people who are in need. Do we not invest $35 billion to help people keep a roof over their heads? I could go on, but you get the point. I'm grateful that the Senate and the House are moving quickly. And I'm prepared to hear their ideas on how to make the package better and make it cheaper. I'm open to that. But we have to make clear who is helped and who is hurt. And my hope is that the Republicans in Congress listen to their constituents. According to the polls, there is overwhelming bipartisan support. The vast majority of the American people -- more than 70 percent of the American people, with all the polls you all conduct, including a majority of Republicans -- want us to act, and act big and quickly and support the plan. Major economists -- left, right, and center -- say we should focus on smart investments we can make now in jobs, in our people to prevent long-term economic damage to our nation and to strengthen the economic competitiveness going forward. In fact, an analysis by the Wall Street firm Moody's estimates that if we pass my American Rescue Plan, the economy will create 7 million jobs this year. This year. We've also been in constant contact with mayors and governors, county officials, members of Congress -- both parties. Both parties. I've met with them in my office; I've met with them in -- on the -- on the Internet -- on -- Zooming on with them. Both parties in every state. And guess what? They agree we have to act now. I got a letter from more than 400 mayors, from big cities and small town. They understand we're not going to get our economy back in shape and the millions of people back to work until we beat this virus. That's why the American Rescue Plan puts 160 million -- billion dollars into more testing and tracing, manufacturing and distribution, and setting up vaccination sites -- everything that's needed to get vaccines into people's arms, which is the most difficult logistical effort the United States has undertaken in peace time. It includes $4 billion for new manufacturing plants so we're ready to manufacture vaccines in the future. We don't have to wait. I'm going to close with what I said before: I'll always be straight with you. I said in my inaugural I'll be -- \"give it to you straight from the shoulders,\" Roosevelt said. Because the American people can take the truth. They can handle anything. I can't give you a date when this crisis will end, but I can tell you we're doing everything possible to have that day come sooner rather than later. And all of you here are doing some of the most important work in this facility, right here, that can be done. And I know this is personal: I walked in today, and I won't say who came up to me, but one of the people in this building came up to me and said, \"My father-in-law is dying from COVID.\" I said, \"Can I call?\" He said, \"No. He couldn't take a call.\" He says, \"Keep him in his prayers, please.\" How many of you know somebody who's in real trouble or has passed? How many people do you know who sat down to breakfast this morning and looked at an empty chair across the table? You've seen the devastation of this virus in your family, your community, but you're stepping up. You're saving lives here -- lives of your loved ones, your neighbors, your fellow Americans. You're showing how this town, this state, this country takes care of our own, leaves nobody behind. We can do anything when we do it together. I believe we're on the road. And I promise you, I know we'll run into bumps. It's not going to be easy here to the end, but we're going to beat this. We're going to beat this. May God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. And, Albert, thank you and your people for all you do. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. President Biden, you've said that you think by the end of July is when we'll have enough vaccines for all Americans. But when do you think all Americans, or a majority, will have actually gotten the vaccine? Well, all we got to do is do a little bit of the math. Getting the vaccine and having it available is not the same as putting it in someone's arms. This is going to be a continuous rolling effort. So we'll have had -- we will have ordered, much of which will have been distributed, over 600 million doses by the end of July. July 29th is the expected date. That could change. Look at what's happening with the weather now, for example: It's slowing up the distribution right now. But I believe we'll be approaching normalcy by the end of this year. And God willing, this Christmas will be different than the last. But I can't make that commitment to you. There are other strains of the virus. We don't know what could happen in terms of production rates. Things can change. But we're doing everything the science has indicated we should do, and people are stepping up to get everything done that has to be done. We're going to have debates about whether or not -- for example, I can't set nationally who gets in line when and first. That's a decision the states make. I can recommend. I can say what I've said -- like, I'm the guy that said we should lower it to 65 years of age. I think 35 states have done that, or more. I think that -- for example, I think it's critically important to get our kids back to school. I think it's really important because of the psychological damage being done and the loss of time. A kid loses a semester when they're in fifth grade -- it means they're not just a semester behind; they may be a year and a half behind. All of the difficulty. You were at that town meeting I had with that little girl who was worried that, you know, her mommy -- told her mommy she worried maybe she's going to die. So there's a lot. I think it's important we get people back in school. There's a difference, for example, according to the science now, between kids between the ages of 3 and probably 12 years old, in terms of whether they can absorb and/or communicate the disease than it is for kids who are 15, 16, 17, and 18 years old who congregate more together. It's harder in a high school than it is in a grammar school. We know certain things are necessary: social distancing, smaller class sizes, ventilation, testing, and the possibility that staff, whether it's the staff taking care of the sanitary conditions in the school, or simply -- you've heard me say this before -- bus drivers. To open the schools, we need more buses and bus drivers. We can't put kids packed in a bus, sitting next to one another. So we know the things that have to be done. The question is the order in which we do them is going to -- determined on what moves the quickest and where the need is the greatest. Obviously, we still have to focus on first responders, our doctors, our nurses, those delivering the services. But the reason I bother to bore you with that detail is to try to explain to the American people that this is a process, but we know now the fundamental basic elements. The fundamental basic elements are that, before you get the shot and after -- if you get the shots and after -- social distancing save lives, wearing masks saves lives, making sure that you wash your hands with hot water saves lives. This is not hyperbole. This is not a political statement. It's a reality. The science has demonstrated that. We also know that it's one thing to have a vaccine available. The problem was, how do you get it into people's arms? There's not enough people to vaccinate. All the great hospitals in this state, and in my state, they can line up and give people, but they can't possibly handle the volume that is needed. So what do you do? You get more people qualified to give vaccinations. The quicker you can open up places and that people can come up and demonstrate they're on -- on the pecking order and they're ready for their shot, and they're qualified -- keeping places open 24/7 makes a lot of sense, but you need people to do it. So we all know the basic things that have to happen. Now, we also know that there are things that intervene. Things happen. Weather. People get ill. People get confused. There's a lot of people who don't -- aren't able. You know, I -- you've heard me say before -- you know, my little granddaughter can use that cellphone of hers to do more in about 12 seconds than I can do it in an hour. But a lot of people aren't able to -- a lot of people who need the help. They say, \"Well, get online.\" Well, they don't have a means to get online. They might not have, you know, the ability to get online, and they may not know how to do it. Talk about -- everybody is -- you know, most people are within five miles of a pharmacy. Well, if you're living alone and you're a 68-year-old woman, and you're in a minority neighborhood, and there's no bus service, you might as well be 500 miles away. That's why we're leading now -- and, Gary, you talked to me about it -- getting mobile vans to go out. So we know the kinds of things that have to be done. But there has never ever, ever been a logistical challenge as consequence -- as consequential as we're trying to do. But we're getting it done. And as my mom would say, with the grace of God and the goodwill of neighbors, we're going to save a lot of lives.

But it's not,\" Kerry said. \"It is coming from the global warming and it threatens all the normal weather patterns.\"\nThe planet is warming in large part because of greenhouse gas emissions that are pumped into the sky from power plants, cars, planes and industry. It even comes from the way we raise and grow our food. America is the second-largest emitter behind China of greenhouse gases that are warming the planet.\nThat warming is believed to make storms stronger, droughts drier and oceans higher. That means certain places on Earth where people currently live will become unlivable. In fact, it is already happening.\nKerry said we have only a few years left to avoid a climate catastrophe.\n\"Well, the scientists told us three years ago we had 12 years to avert the worst consequences of climate crisis. We are now three years gone, so we have nine years left,\" he said.\nThat's where the Paris accord, a climate treaty dedicated to lowering greenhouse gas emissions in more than 180 countries around the world, comes in. It was named after the City of Light, where it was agreed to back in 2015. But the pledges made then by nearly every country on Earth to cut their planet-warming emissions will no longer cut it.\n\"Even if we did everything that we said we were going to do when we signed up in Paris we would see a rise in the Earth's temperature to somewhere around 3.7 degrees or more, which is catastrophic,\" Kerry said.\nWhen Kerry was secretary of state in 2016 he signed the Paris climate accord. A year later he watched his signature accomplishment erased by then-President Trump. In 2017, Mr. Trump announced he was pulling out of the landmark deal. His administration rolled back more than 100 environmental regulations.\nBut renewable energy like wind turbines and solar panels are now much cheaper and are providing record amounts of energy in the U.S., putting some coal plants out of business.\nAutomakers like Tesla that make luxury cars that run on batteries have inspired other car manufacturing companies to do the same. General Motors announced in January it will go mostly electric by 2035. Kerry said that's great news, but the country will need to transition to clean energy much faster and this will both create and cut jobs. He also said there's been too little action and too much hot air.\n\"There is no room for B.S. anymore.

The USA and England have it … so Cambodia made this sub-decree by learning from other countries.”", "orig_verdict": "Misleading", "fulltext": "Prime Minister Hun Sen signed a National Internet Gateway into existence this week, as a government spokesperson explained the initiative would help to control “disorderly” internet service providers.\nA rights group raised concerns that the policy would further shrink the space for online speech, but one technology expert said the type of facility had already been made “completely obsolete by modern technology.”\nThe sub-decree, signed on Monday, allows the government to appoint an operator to control the gateway, which would be overseen by the Telecommunications Ministry, Telecom Regulator of Cambodia and other relevant authorities.\nAmong its roles, the operator would be allowed to “take action to prevent and disconnect all networks that impact national revenue, safety, public order, morality, culture, traditions [and] norms,” as well as follow other instructions from the Telecom Ministry.\nThe sub-decree also requires the gateway operator to collect identification information for all internet users in the country.\nAs part of the policy, the internet gateway operator would have to file to the ministry reports monthly, quarterly and annually on internet traffic, and the ministry could suspend or revoke the operator’s license if it is not content with the operator’s work.\nAll internet service providers would need to reroute their networks through the new national gateway by next February, the sub-decree says.\nTelecommunications Ministry spokesperson Meas Po said the ministry would soon make an announcement seeking companies to operate the internet gateway.\nHe added that the policy is also meant to “legitimize” the country’s internet service providers, as there are several operators in the market.\n“After the sub-decree is issued, each company has to ask for a license from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications or the Telecommunications Regulator of Cambodia, and the ministry will issue conditions for providing licenses,” he said. “This is to have clear gateways, and we can control the data easily.”\nHe further defended the decision to collect user identification, saying it was no different than applying for a SIM card.\nGovernment spokesperson Phay Siphan said it was completely within the government’s rights and duties to establish an internet gateway in order to control social order.\n“When we first drive a car, we have to follow the traffic law,” he said. “[Is there] any country which does not control the Internet? The USA and England have it, and they have spent a lot of money on counterterrorism, so Cambodia made this sub-decree by learning from other countries.”\nSiphan described the internet in Cambodia as “disorderly,” as there were about 10 internet operators.\nIn 2018, one internet provider, Sinet, announced on Twitter that it had followed government orders requesting all internet service providers to block the website of the defunct newspaper the Cambodia Daily. But the Daily’s website had remained accessible on some internet providers.\nJames Griffiths, an expert on China’s “Great Firewall” — that country’s method of widespread digital censorship — said Cambodia’s plan seems to follow a similar model to the Chinese gateway.\nThe Great Firewall also uses private companies, from internet service providers and telecom companies to social media platforms, in order to maintain the high level of censorship. Though the Chinese system works because the government is “confident that it has the legal or political powers to punish the companies should they step out of line.”\nHe noted that the gateway operator is allowed to block content for an “incredibly broad” range of issues, but it is too early to tell how they would apply this mandate.\n“In theory … the authorities could block any websites or content they want to,” he said in an email. “The technology for this is not particularly complicated, and has existed for a long time, it works similarly to how an office or school network may block certain websites, just on a national scale. The test of the system would be how it handles attempts to circumvent blocking, using tools such as VPNs, proxy servers, or the TOR network.”\nPhil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said the sub-decree was passed without independent oversight, and that the government had not addressed any of the concerns that civil society raised after the draft text leaked last year.\n“Prime Minister Hun Sen struck a dangerous blow against internet freedom and e-commerce in Cambodia by expanding the government’s control over the country’s internet,” Robertson said in a statement. “Foreign governments, tech companies, e-commerce businesses, and other private actors should urgently call on the government to reverse the adoption of this harmful sub-decree.”\nHowever, Mike Gaertner, the founder of the Cambodian Network Exchange and co-founder and chief operations officer of Sabay Digital, said the government’s attempt to regulate content through the gateway could be futile.\n“If you start at the discussion about a national internet gateway, it was basically something that was a relevant institution to set up 10 years ago and has been made completely obsolete by modern technology,” he said.\nThe Cambodian government already has the power to regulate the internet content of users inside the country — via a team of content moderators and traditional investigation methods, he said — but it would not be able to regulate content produced out of state.\nThe new sub-decree also focuses on internet service providers, but content providers like Google and Facebook keep interactions between users encrypted, so the government could potentially detect the presence of conversations but not what’s said between parties.\nLikewise, the gateway would not be able to detect Facebook’s local advertising in order to charge it taxes, an issue that is currently putting local services, which are taxed, at a disadvantage, he said.\n“Your opportunity to influence the content providers … is very limited and very expensive,” he said. He added that any internet service provider that attempts to take up the task of gateway operator would be unable to follow orders to block content, or end up slowing internet speeds in order to do so, which would violate the gateway law’s requirement to maintain internet capacity.\nHe said the Cambodian Network Exchange was started as a way to give internet providers and telecom companies access to all networks, and by 2019 all ISPs were involved. This is further beneficial to content producers in Cambodia, from news sites to businesses to apps, he said, as they can access customers regardless what internet service they’re using.\nHe’s not sure what impact the gateway will have on the Cambodian Network Exchange, and he hasn’t yet been advised by the ministry. In terms of enforcement, Gaertner said he believed the government is within its rights to control domestic internet content, and he dismissed civil society concerns over the gateway because the gateway would not technically change the investigations of posts and social media conversations that are already happening. However, he felt the government should instead focus on “data sovereignty,” or bringing cloud computing platforms into Cambodia.\nSiphan, the government spokesperson, quashed civil society concerns, claiming that other governments had done more to suppress the internet.\n“What civil society or non governmental organizations have mentioned are negative things about how the government has responsibility under the law … they are not civil society but they are activists against the government, and even though the government copied the law from the USA, they said it is wrong.”\nIn December, a coalition of internet companies, including Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Twitter, issued a statement saying the gateway plan posed risks to businesses, citizens’ rights and internet speeds.\nUpdated at 3:45 p.m. with comment from Mike Gaertner.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misstated that the gateway could help tax foreign companies like Facebook."}, {"claim": "5G Towers Cause COVID-19.", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Refuted", "justification": "The answers and sources show that the claim is incorrect so the claim is refuted.", "claim_date": "18-2-2021", "speaker": "67podcast", "original_claim_url": "https://www.instagram.com/tv/CLb-7k4J2rY/?utm_source=ig_embed", "fact_checking_article": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210720224116/https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2021/03/fact-check-covid-virus-has-been-identified-and-pcr-test-is-legitimate.html", "reporting_source": "Instagram", "location_ISO_code": null, "claim_types": ["Event/Property Claim"], "fact_checking_strategies": ["Written Evidence", "Fact-checker Reference"], "questions": [{"question": "What is a 5g Tower?", "answers": [{"answer": "When a person makes a mobile phone call, a signal is sent from the phone to a Cell tower.

By now, all have heard the stories of what took place on the plane.\nTales of shocking and horrid perversion involving adults, children, animals, plant life, you name it. No one good went on that plane.\nMost of all, the jet was known for the children that were found there. Jeffrey Epstein was a pedophile and child trafficker. His “wares” were found on the aircraft. That is what he was bigly known for.\nWhen the flight logs for the jet were released to the public, a shocking list of celebrities and politicians was found. Everyone knows that means – each of the people who flew on the jet was guilty of the most horrid crimes. That was a given.\nAfter that first release, we thought we had seen all the names, but that was not the case. Additional logs were eventually given to the press, on which a few more very high profile names stood out. One of these was none other than Sleepy Joe Biden, the Democrat running for President. Biden was on board the Express 15 years ago, traveling between Florida and Florida. It was a short trip, yes, But he was on the plane. And we all know what that means.\nThe former Vice-President’s office had no comment on the matter, leaving the following comment for the record:\n“Joe Biden does not deny having been on the plane. It should be noted, however, that he did not go to Epstein’s Isle. He just went up in the air, clapped his hands repeatedly and screamed, ‘WHEEEEE!’ The entire trip lasted under 15 minutes.\nNothing sickening took place and no children were involved. The only way one could suggest anything close to that would be by noting the childlike sense of glee that overcomes Biden whenever he flies.”\nThe Biden camp can deny this all they want. The fact remains that Creepy Joe was on that plane and only perverts ever boarded. That is a hard and fast rule that was decided upon by the republican brain trust some time ago. There are no exceptions, except for Trump.\nHis appearance in the logs shows he did not travel to Epstein Island as Biden did, and that the flight was strictly for business purposes. His was the only flight on record, in fact, when the jet did not travel to the tropical island of sin.\nBiden is just as guilty as Epstein and every single person in Hollywood.

It is wondrous in its diversity.\nOur national flower, the Protea, is a species of fynbos.\nWhen I opened the third National Investment Conference last year, I spoke of the Protea's unique properties that in so many ways resemble our national character.\nWhat is most unique and special about fynbos is that to be sustainable and survive, it needs fire.\nAt least once every twenty years, fynbos must burn at extremely high temperatures to allow the ecosystem to be rejuvenated and grow afresh.\nThroughout the summer, the burned foliage lies desolate. But when the autumn rains return, the seeds germinate, and its life cycle begins all over again.\nThe mountains bloom with new life as plants which once seemed lost grow back even stronger than before.\nWe, the people of South Africa, have over the past year experienced a terrible hardship.\nLike a wildfire that sweeps across the mountainous ranges where the fynbos grows, a deadly pandemic has swept across the world, leaving devastation in its path.\nAnd yet, like the hardy fynbos of our native land, we too have proven to be resilient in many ways.\nFor three centuries, we were victims of oppression, dispossession and injustice.\nAnd for three centuries, we resisted.\nThe flames of injustice may have scarred us, but they did not consume us.\nThe rains of democracy brought rejuvenation and the birth of a new nation.\nWe have risen time and time again from the depths of darkness to herald a new day.\nAs we look on the grave damage that this disease has caused, we know that like the fynbos, like all those who have walked this land before us, we will rise again.\nNearly a year has passed since South Africa saw its first case of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19.\nSince then, nearly one-and-a-half million people in our country are known to have been infected by the virus.\nMore than 45 000 people are known to have died.\nBeyond these statistics lies a human story of tragedy and pain.\nThere is no family, no community and no place of work that has not lost someone they knew, worked with and loved.\nIt is also a story of courage and resilience.\nThe resilience of the hospital worker who – day after day, night after night – goes to work to save lives, knowing that they, themselves, are at risk of infection.\nIt is a wonderful account of the courage of the police officer, the soldier, the essential worker, the carer and all those on the frontline, who have kept our country safe, our people fed and our economy going.\nIt is a story of solidarity and compassion.\nOf a nation that has stood together to confront COVID-19 in ways not seen since the early days of our democracy.\nMore than anything else, this crisis has revealed the true character of our remarkable nation.\nIt has revealed a spirit of the people who refused to be defeated.\nIt is this South African spirit that must drive our resolve to build a new and more equal economy and a better, more just society.\nThe year ahead must be a time for change, for progress and for rebirth.\nIt must be a year in which we rise.\nThis is no ordinary year, and this is no ordinary SoNA.\nI will therefore, focus this evening on the foremost, overriding priorities of 2021.\nFirst, we must defeat the coronavirus pandemic.\nSecond, we must accelerate our economic recovery.\nThird, we must implement economic reforms to create sustainable jobs and drive inclusive growth.\nAnd finally, we must fight corruption and strengthen the State.\nIn the coming weeks, we will address the other important elements of government’s programme for the year.\nFundamental to our nation’s recovery is an unrelenting and comprehensive response to overcome the coronavirus.\nSouth Africa has just emerged from the second wave of infections since COVID-19 arrived on our shores in March last year.\nDriven by a new variant of the virus, this second wave was more severe and cost many more lives than the first wave.\nNevertheless, the human cost could have been far greater.\nHad we not moved quickly to restrict movement and activity, had we not prepared our health facilities, had South Africans not observed the basic health protocols, the devastation caused by this virus could have been far worse.\nThis year, we must do everything in our means to contain and overcome this pandemic.\nThis means intensifying our prevention efforts and strengthening our health system.\nIt also means that we must undertake a massive vaccination programme to save lives and dramatically reduce infections across the population.\nEarlier this week, we were informed that one of the vaccines that we had procured, the AstraZeneca vaccine, offers minimal protection from mild to moderate infection by the new variant known as 501Y.v2.\nThis is according to early findings of a study by our scientists and researchers.\nWe applaud these scientists for leading this research and providing new evidence that is vital for guiding our response.\nSince this variant is now the dominant variant in our country, these findings have significant implications for the pace, design and sequencing of our vaccine programme.\nWhile it should not delay the start of the vaccination programme by much, it will affect the choice of vaccines and the manner of their deployment.\nThe first phase of our vaccination programme, which is targeted at health and other frontline workers, will now use the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which has been shown to be effective against the 501Y.V2 variant.\nWe have secured nine million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\nThe first batch, of 80 000 doses, will arrive in the country next week.\nFurther consignments will arrive over the next four weeks, totalling 500 000 Johnson & Johnson vaccines.\nAll provinces have rollout plans in place as the first vaccines come through.\nI wish to thank all provinces for their level of preparedness for this massive undertaking that we are about to embark upon.\nIn addition, we have secured 12 million vaccine doses from the global COVAX facility.\nThis will be complemented by other vaccines that are available to South Africa through the African Union’s (AU) African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team Facility.\nPfizer has committed 20 million vaccine doses, commencing with deliveries at the end of the first quarter.\nWe are continuing our engagements with all the vaccine manufacturers to ensure that we secure sufficient quantities of vaccines that are suitable to our conditions.\nThe health and safety of our people remains our paramount concern.\nAll medication imported into the country is monitored, evaluated, investigated, inspected and registered by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority.\nWe will continue to use the science-driven approach that has served us well since the earliest days of the pandemic.\nThe success of the vaccination programme will rely on active collaboration between all sectors of society.\nWe are greatly encouraged by the active involvement of business, labour, the health industry and medical schemes, in particular, in preparing for this mass vaccination drive.\nAs we have overcome before, we will overcome again and rise.\nBut it is not just this disease that we must defeat.\nWe must overcome poverty, hunger, joblessness and inequality.\nWe must overcome a legacy of exclusion and dispossession that continues to impoverish our people, and which this pandemic has severely worsened.\nWhen I delivered the SoNA in this House last year, none of us could have imagined how – within a matter of weeks – our country and our world would have changed so dramatically.\nOur plans had to be adapted in response to a global emergency.\nBudgets had to be reprioritised and many programmes had to be deferred.\nOver the past year, South Africa has experienced a sharp decline in growth and a significant increase in unemployment.\nPoverty is on the rise. Inequality is deepening.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, our economy was 6% smaller than it was in the last quarter of 2019.\nThere were 1,7 million fewer people employed in the third quarter of 2020 than there were in the first quarter, before the pandemic struck.\nOur unemployment rate now stands at a staggering 30,8%.\nAs a result of the relief measures that we implemented and the phased reopening of the economy, we expect to see a strong recovery in employment by the end of the year.\nAs we worked to contain the spread of the virus, we also had to take extraordinary measures to support ordinary South Africans, assist businesses in distress and protect people’s livelihoods.\nThe Social and Economic Relief Package that we introduced in April last year is the largest intervention of its kind in our history.\nIt identified measures worth a total of R500 billion – or about 10% of our gross domestic product – to provide cash directly to the poorest households, to provide wage support to workers and to provide various forms of relief to struggling businesses.\nA total of 18 million people, or close to one-third of the population, received additional grant payments through these relief measures.\nIt is estimated that this grant lifted more than five million people above the food poverty line, helping to alleviate hunger in a moment of great crisis.\nTo date, more than R57 billion in wage support has been paid to over 4,5 million workers through the special Unemployment Insurance Fund Temporary Employer-Employee Relief Scheme (TERS).\nMore than R1,3 billion has been provided in support mainly for small- and medium-sized businesses.\nIn addition, over R70 billion in tax relief was extended to businesses in distress.\nAround R18,9 billion in loans have been approved for 13 000 businesses through the Loan Guarantee Scheme.\nFellow South Africans,\nIt is nearly four months since I stood here before a joint sitting of this Parliament to present to the nation the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan.\nThis evening, we stand here not to make promises but to report on progress in the implementation of the recovery plan and the priority actions we must take to restore growth and create jobs.\nSince the launch of the plan, we have focused on four priority interventions:\n- a massive rollout of infrastructure throughout the country,\n- a massive increase in local production,\n- an employment stimulus to create jobs and support livelihoods, and\n- the rapid expansion of our energy generation capacity.\nWe announced that we would be embarking on a massive rollout of infrastructure throughout the country.\nWe knew that to achieve this objective we would need to steadily rebuild technical skills within government to prepare and manage large infrastructure projects.\nWe have now developed an infrastructure investment project pipeline worth R340 billion in network industries such as energy, water, transport and telecommunications.\nConstruction has started and progress is being made on a number of these projects.\nSince the announcement of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, we have launched two major human settlements projects that will provide homes to almost 68 000 households in the Gauteng province.\nSimilar human settlements projects are planned in other provinces.\nTwo years ago, I spoke about the dream of building new cities that will enable us to make a break with apartheid’s spatial development.\nNew post-apartheid cities are being conceptualised in a number of places in our country.\nThe Lanseria Smart City, the first new city to be built in a democratic South Africa, is now a reality in the making.\nThe draft masterplan for this smart city – which will become home to between 350 000 to 500 000 people within the next decade – was completed in November 2020 and is now out for public comment.\nProgress is being made on several major water infrastructure projects.\nThese include Phase 2A of the Mokolo and Crocodile River Project, and the uMkhomazi Water Project.\nThe Infrastructure Investment Plan identifies roads projects worth R19 billion covering the spine of the South African road network.\nWork is underway to finalise finance structuring for these projects.\nResources have been committed from the fiscus to support the construction and rehabilitation of the major N1, N2 and N3 highways.\nThese infrastructure projects will lead to the revival of the construction industry and the creation of much-needed jobs.\nThe R100 billion Infrastructure Fund is now in full operation.\nThis fund will blend resources from the fiscus with financing from the private sector and development institutions.\nIts approved project pipeline for 2021 is varied and includes the Student Housing Infrastructure Programme, which aims to provide 300 000 student beds.\nAnother approved project is SA Connect, a programme to roll out broadband to schools, hospitals, police stations and other government facilities.\nThe second priority intervention of the recovery plan is to support a massive increase in local production and to make South African exports globally competitive.\nThis will encourage greater investment by the private sector in productive activity.\nKey to this plan is a renewed commitment from government, business and organised labour to buy local.\nThis commitment should lead to increased local production, which will lead to the revival of our manufacturing industry.\nAll social partners that participated in the development of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, as part of our social compact, have agreed to work together to reduce our reliance on imports by 20% over the next five years.\nThey have identified 42 products – ranging from edible oils to furniture, fruit concentrates, personal protective equipment, steel products and green economy inputs – that can be sourced locally.\nIf we achieve our target, we will significantly expand our productive economy, potentially returning more than R200 billion to the country’s annual output.\nLast year, we undertook to create a larger market for small businesses and designate 1 000 locally produced products that must be procured from Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs).\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic forced the closure of global value chains, we have been able to speed up this initiative as the local supply chains became open for locally manufactured products.\nTo this end, Cabinet approved the SMME-Focused Localisation Policy Framework which identified the 1 000 products.\nFurthermore, the departments of Small Business Development and Trade, Industry and Competition are supporting SMMEs to access larger domestic and international markets.\nThese efforts are supported by robust manufacturing support programmes.\nIn the SoNA last year, I said that our vision for industrialisation is underpinned by sector master plans to rejuvenate and grow key industries.\nFour master plans that have been completed and signed to date – which are part of the social compact between labour, business, government and communities – have already had an impact in their respective industries.\nThrough the implementation of the Poultry Master Plan, the industry has invested R800 million to upgrade production.\nSouth Africa now produces an additional one million chickens every week.\nThe Sugar Master Plan was signed during the lockdown, with a commitment from large users of sugar to procure at least 80% of their sugar needs from local growers.\nThrough the implementation of the plan, last year saw a rise in local production and a decline in imported sugar, creating stability for an industry which employs some 85 000 workers.\nSupport for black small-scale farmers is being stepped up, with a large beverage producer committing to expand their procurement sharply.\nSince the signing of the Clothing, Textile, Footwear and Leather Masterplan in November 2019, the industry has invested more than half a billion rand to expand local manufacturing facilities, including SMMEs.\nWe have worked closely with the auto sector to help it weather the pandemic.\nBy the end of the year, the sector had recovered around 70% of its normal annual production, in difficult circumstances.\nLast week, the Ford Motor Company announced a R16 billion investment to expand their manufacturing facility in Tshwane for the next generation Ford Ranger bakkie.\nThis investment will support the growth of around 12 small and medium enterprises in automotive component manufacturing.\nNearly half of the procurement spend on construction of the bulk earthworks and top structure at the Tshwane Special Economic Zone during this phase is expected to be allocated for SMMEs, an amount equal to R1,7 billion in procurement opportunities.\nToyota has invested in its KwaZulu-Natal facility to start production of the first generation of hybrid electric vehicles to come off a South African assembly line.\nThis follows investment announcements by Nissan, Mercedes Benz and Isuzu in expanded production facilities, all of which cement South Africa’s position as a global player in auto manufacturing.\nThis year, our focus will be on getting the industry back to full production, implementing the Black Industrialist Fund and working on a new platform for expanded auto trade with the rest of the continent.\nThis will be part of our concerted effort to boost the manufacturing sector.\nThis year, we will begin to harness the opportunities presented by the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which came into operation on 1 January, following the adoption of the Johannesburg Declaration by the AU.\nThe AfCFTA provides a platform for South African businesses to expand into markets across the continent, and for South Africa to position itself as a gateway to the continent.\nTo address the deep inequalities in our society, we must accelerate the implementation of broad-based black economic empowerment policies on ownership, control and management of the economy.\nLast year, government agreed to landmark deals with companies that will advance black economic empowerment by transferring ownership to their workers.\nIn November last year, we held our third South Africa Investment Conference to review the implementation of previous commitments and to generate new investment into our economy.\nEven under difficult economic circumstances, the investment conference managed to raise some R108 billion in additional investment commitments.\nTogether with investment confirmed from the two previous conferences, we have now received R773 billion in investment commitments towards our five-year target of R1,2 trillion.\nFirms have reported that some R183 billion of these investments has already flowed into projects that benefit the South African economy.\nThis shows that our country is still an attractive investment destination for both local and offshore companies.\nWe have worked to facilitate investment by increasing the ease of doing business, including making it easier to start a business.\nIn the past year, more than 125 000 new companies were registered through the BizPortal platform, completing their registration in just a matter of hours from the comfort of their homes or offices.\nWe are making it easier for business to do business.\nOur third priority intervention is an employment stimulus to create jobs and support livelihoods.\nThe largest numbers of jobs will be created by the private sector in a number of industries as the economy recovers.\nWe continue to work in a social compact with the private sector to create a more conducive environment for them to be able to create jobs.\nOur compact with the private sector is underpinned by a clear commitment to grow our economy and to create jobs.\nHowever, the public sector has a responsibility to stimulate job creation; both through its policies and through direct job creation opportunities.\nThe Presidential Employment Stimulus is one of the most significant expansions of public and social employment in South Africa’s history.\nBy the end of January 2021, over 430 000 opportunities were already supported through the stimulus.\nA further 180 000 opportunities are currently in the recruitment process.\nThese opportunities are in areas like education, arts and culture, global business services, early childhood development (ECD), and small-scale and subsistence farming.\nIt involves environmental programmes such as the clearing of alien trees, wetland rehabilitation, fire prevention, and cleaning and greening across all municipalities.\nThese programmes are about real lives and real livelihoods.\nNearly half a million people are now receiving an income, developing new skills and contributing to their community and the country’s economy.\nWe will continue to support employment for as long as it is necessary while the labour market recovers, even as we work to promote stronger and more resilient growth in the private sector.\nIn the SoNA last year, in response to the huge challenge our country faces of youth unemployment, I announced that the National Youth Development Agency and the Department of Small Business Development would provide grant funding and business support to 1 000 young entrepreneurs within 100 days.\nWhile the programme had to be put on hold due to the coronavirus restrictions, it nevertheless managed to reach its target of 1 000 businesses by International Youth Day on 12 August 2020.\nThis provides a firm foundation for our efforts to support 15 000 start-ups by 2024.\nLast year, we said we would establish the National Pathway Management Network to provide support and opportunities to young people across the country.\nI want to encourage every young South African to join the more than 1,2 million people who are already in the network, and take their next steps to a better future.\nOf the many hardships our people had to experience last year, schooling disruption placed a huge burden on learners, teachers and families.\nDespite this, they persevered.\nIt is our priority for this year to regain lost time and improve educational outcomes, from the early years through to high school and post-school education and training.\nThe fourth priority intervention of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan is to rapidly expand energy generation capacity.\nRestoring Eskom to operational and financial health and accelerating its restructuring process is central to this objective.\nEskom has been restructured into three separate entities for generation, transmission and distribution.\nThis will lay the foundations for an efficient, modern and competitive energy system.\nEskom is making substantial progress with its intensive maintenance and operational excellence programmes to improve the reliability of its coal fleet.\nWe are working closely with Eskom on proposals to improve its financial position, manage its debt and reduce its dependence on the fiscus.\nThis requires a review of the tariff path to ensure that it reflects all reasonable costs and measures to resolve the problem of municipal debt.\nIn December 2020, government and its social partners signed the historic Eskom Social Compact, which outlines the necessary actions we must take, collectively and as individual constituencies, to meet the country’s energy needs now and into the future.\nOver the last year, we have taken action to urgently and substantially increase generation capacity in addition to what Eskom generates:\n- The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy will soon be announcing the successful bids for 2 000 megawatts (MW) of emergency power.\n- The necessary regulations have been amended and the requirements clarified for municipalities to buy power from independent power producers. Systems are being put in place to support qualifying municipalities.\n- Government will soon be initiating the procurement of an additional 11 800 MW of power from renewable energy, natural gas, battery storage and coal in line with the Integrated Resource Plan 2019.\nDespite this work, Eskom estimates that, without additional capacity, there will be an electricity supply shortfall of between 4 000 and 6 000 MW over the next five years, as old coal-fired power stations reach their end of life.\nAs part of the measures to address this shortfall, we will in the coming weeks issue a request for proposals for 2 600 MW from wind and solar energy as part of Bid Window 5.\nThis will be followed by another bid window in August 2021.\nRecent analysis suggests that easing the licensing requirements for new embedded generation projects could unlock up to 5 000 MW of additional capacity and help to ease the impact of load shedding.\nWe will therefore amend Schedule 2 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 2006 (Act 4 of 2006) within the next three months to increase the licensing threshold for embedded generation.\nThis will include consultation among key stakeholders on the level at which the new threshold should be set and the finalisation of the necessary enabling frameworks.\nEskom has already started work to expedite its commercial and technical processes to allow this additional capacity onto the grid without undue delay.\nAs we mobilise all of the resources at our disposal to support economic recovery, we cannot lose sight of the threat that climate change poses to our environmental health, socioeconomic development and economic growth.\nWe are, therefore, working to fulfil our commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement which include the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\nEskom, our largest greenhouse gas emitter, has committed in principle to net zero emission by 2050 and to increase its renewable capacity.\nEskom will be looking to partner with investors to repurpose and repower part of its coal fleet.\nThis will be done in a way that stimulates investment, local economic activity and local manufacturing, as part of a just transition.\nOur work on climate change will be guided by the Presidential Coordinating Commission on Climate Change, which is meeting for the first time this month.\nThe commission will work on a plan for a just transition to a low-carbon economy and climate resilient society.\nWe will not achieve higher rates of growth and employment if we do not implement structural economic reforms.\nThese reforms are necessary to reduce costs and barriers to entry, increase competition, stimulate new investment and create space for new entrants in the market.\nThis work is being driven through Operation Vulindlela, which involves a team in the National Treasury and the President’s office.\nOperation Vulindlela is focusing on reforms in the electricity, water, telecommunications and transport sectors, as well as reforms to our visa and immigration regime.\nThe completion of digital migration is vital to our ability to effectively harness the enormous opportunities presented by technological change.\nAfter many delays, we will begin the phased switch-off of our analogue television transmitters from next month.\nIt is anticipated that this process, which will be done province-by-province, will be completed by the end of March 2022.\nThe process for the licensing of high-demand spectrum is at an advanced stage.\nWe hope that the ongoing litigation on the licensing matter will provide legal certainty and will not unduly delay the spectrum auction process.\nIn the water sector, we are working through Operation Vulindlela to ensure that water license applications are finalised within the revised timeframe of 90 days; and to revive the Green Drop and Blue Drop programmes to strengthen water quality monitoring.\nWe will finalise and implement the revised Raw Water Pricing Strategy, and accelerate the establishment of a national water resources infrastructure agency.\nOur ability to compete in global markets depends on the efficiency of our ports and rail network.\nWe are repositioning Durban as a hub port for the Southern Hemisphere and developing Ngqura as the container terminal of choice.\nThe rail corridor from Gauteng is being extended to enable the export of vehicles through Port Elizabeth.\nThese are crucial steps to move freight from road to rail and increase the competitiveness of the rail system.\nWork is underway with the relevant departments to reform our visa and immigration regime to attract skills and grow the tourism sector.\nAs international travel starts to recover in the wake of COVID-19, we will undertake a full rollout of eVisas to visitors from China, India, Nigeria, Kenya and 10 other countries.\nThe revised list of critical skills will be published for public comment by the Department of Home Affairs, within one week, to ensure that the final version reflects the skills needed by the economy.\nThe momentum that Operation Vulindlela has already built, and the support that it has received across government, shows that we are serious about reform.\nWe will continue to work relentlessly and without pause to create a more modern, efficient and competitive economy that is more open to all South Africans.\nTo support our reform process, the Presidential State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Council has outlined a clear set of reforms that will enable these vital public companies to fulfil their mandate for growth and development.\nOverarching legislation for state-owned companies will be tabled in Cabinet this financial year and in Parliament in the next the financial year.\nA centralised SOE model is being implemented this financial year, which will ensure a standardised governance, financial management and operational performance framework for all SOEs.\nThe mandates of all SOEs are being re-evaluated to ensure that they are responsive to the country’s needs and the implementation of the National Development Plan.\nIn the midst of the economic damage caused by COVID-19, South Africa’s agricultural sector has performed remarkably well.\nIn 2020, we became the world’s second-largest exporter of citrus, with strong export growth in wine, maize, nuts, deciduous fruit and sugar cane.\nThe favourable weather conditions in 2020 and the beginning of 2021 mean that agriculture is likely to grow in the near term.\nThis provides an opportunity for further public-private partnership in agriculture to promote transformation and ensure sustainable growth.\nIt is an opportunity to accelerate land redistribution through a variety of instruments such as land restitution and expropriation of land in order to boost agricultural output.\nTo date, government has redistributed over five million hectares (ha) of land, totalling around 5 500 farms, to more than 300 000 beneficiaries.\nThis is in addition to the land restitution process, which has benefited over two million land claimants and resulted in the transfer of around 2,7 million ha.\nWe are also pursuing programmes to assist smallholder and emerging farmers with market access, to develop skills across the entire agricultural value chain and increase the number of commercial black farmers.\nDuring the course of the next financial year, we will establish a land and agrarian reform agency to fast-track land reform.\nThe Public Service is at the coalface of government, and lack of professionalism does not just impact service delivery; it also dents public confidence.\nAdvancing honesty, ethics and integrity in the Public Service is critical if we are to build a capable state.\nThrough the National School of Government, we continue to roll out courses and training programmes for government officials from entry level to senior management and the Executive.\nIn October last year, I signed off on ministerial performance agreements with all Ministers, which have now been published online.\nThis will enhance accountability and focused performance by members of the Executive.\nWe remain on course to build a capable and professional civil service that delivers on its mandate and is accountable to the South African people.\nWe are proceeding with our efforts to strengthen the local government infrastructure and accelerate service delivery through the District Development Model.\nThe model brings all three spheres of government to focus on key priorities and implementation of critical high impact projects.\nWorking with both public and private sector partners, government is implementing a range of measures to support municipalities to address inadequate and inconsistent service delivery in areas such water provision, infrastructure build and maintenance.\nWe are focusing on the appointment of properly qualified officials at a local level to ensure effective management and provision of services.\nAs we prepare for local government elections, which are due take place this year, we will need to adjust to the conditions forced upon us by COVID-19 to ensure that the people of this country can determine who represents them at this crucial level of government.\nFellow South Africans,\nCorruption is one of the greatest impediments to the country’s growth and development.\nThe revelations from the Zondo Commission of Inquiry lay bare the extent of state capture and related corruption.\nTestimony at the commission has shown how the criminal justice system was compromised and weakened.\nIt is, therefore, vital that we sustain the momentum of the rebuilding effort that we began three years ago.\nThere has been great progress in turning around law enforcement bodies.\nCritical leadership positions have been filled with capable, experienced and trustworthy professionals.\nThere is improved cooperation and sharing of resources between the respective law enforcement agencies, enabling a more integrated approach to investigations and prosecutions.\nWe have started implementation of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy, which lays the basis for a comprehensive and integrated society-wide response to corruption.\nWe will shortly be appointing members of the National Anti-Corruption Advisory Council, which is a multi-sectoral body that will oversee the initial implementation of the strategy and the establishment of an independent statutory anti-corruption body that reports to Parliament.\nWhen reports started to surface last year about possible fraud and corruption in the procurement of COVID-19-related goods and services, we acted decisively to put a stop to these practices, to investigate all allegations and to act against those responsible.\nWe established a fusion centre, which brings together key law enforcement agencies to share information and resources.\nThe fusion centre has brought many cases to trial and preserved or recovered millions of rands in public funds.\nThe Special Investigating Unit (SIU) was authorised to investigate allegations of unlawful conduct with respect to COVID-19 procurement by all state bodies during the National State of Disaster.\nAs it reported last week, the SIU has finalised investigations into 164 contracts with a total value of R3,5 billion.\nIn a significant advance for transparency and accountability, the Political Party Funding Act, 2018 (Act 6 of 2018) will come into operation on 1 April this year.\nThis will regulate public and private funding of political parties. Among other things, it requires the disclosure of donations to parties and establishes two funds that will enable represented political parties to undertake their programmes.\nCrime and violence continue to undermine people’s sense of safety and security.\nTackling crime is central to the success of our recovery.\nCrimes like cable theft, railway infrastructure vandalism, land invasions, construction site disruptions and attacks on truck drivers hamper economic activity and discourage investment.\nWe have taken steps and will continue to stop these crimes and deal with those responsible in terms of the law.\nTask teams have been set up in a number of provinces to deal with extortion and violence on sites of economic activity.\nWe are also fast-tracking the implementation and capacitation of the Border Management Agency to curb illegal immigration and cross-border crime.\nEnding gender-based violence (GBV) is imperative if we lay claim to being a society rooted in equality and non-sexism.\nWhen I launched the National Strategic Plan on Gender-Based Violence and Femicide (GBVF) in April last year, I made a promise to the women and children of this country that we were going to strengthen the Criminal Justice System to prevent them being traumatised again, and to ensure that perpetrators face justice.\nTo give effect to this, three key pieces of legislation were introduced in Parliament last year to make the criminal justice system more effective in combatting GBV.\nTo ensure that perpetrators are brought to book, we are making progress in reducing the backlog of GBV cases.\nWe continue to provide care and support to survivors of GBV.\nIn the SoNA last year, I said that we would prioritise the economic empowerment of women.\nLast year, Cabinet approved a policy that 40% of public procurement should go to women-owned businesses and entities.\nSeveral departments have started implementing this policy and are making progress.\nLast week, we also launched a groundbreaking private sector-led GBVF Response Fund.\nSeveral South African companies and global philanthropies made pledges to the value of R128 million.\nOver the next three years, government will allocate approximately R12 billion to implement the various components of the National Strategic Plan.\nGBV will only end when everyone takes responsibility for doing so in their homes, in their communities, in their workplaces, in their places of worship and in their schools.\nEqually, we need to give attention to issues affecting children, including improving school-readiness, ECD planning and funding, protection against preventable diseases, policy reform around child welfare and reducing violence against children.\nIn the year ahead, we are also going to forge ahead with efforts to provide greater opportunities for persons with disabilities to participate in the economy and in society in general.\nAs we rebuild our economy in the midst of a pandemic, it is necessary that we continue – within our means – to provide support to those businesses and individuals that continue to be most affected.\nBusinesses in several sectors are still struggling and many families continue to suffer as the job market slowly recovers.\nOver the last few months, we have had ongoing discussions with our social partners in business, labour and community-based organisations, who proposed an extension of some of the social and economic support.\nWe have, therefore, decided to extend the period for the Special COVID-19 Grant of R350 by a further three months.\nThis has proven to be an effective and efficient short-term measure to reduce the immediate impact on the livelihoods of poor South Africans.\nWe have also decided to extend the COVID-19 TERS benefit until 15 March 2021, only for those sectors that have not been able to open and operate.\nThe conditions of this extension and the sectors to be included will be announced after consultations with social partners at the National Economic Development and Labour Council.\nThe National Treasury will work with its partners and stakeholders on improvements to the Loan Guarantee Scheme so that it better addresses the realities of SMMEs and other businesses as they strive to recover.\nWe will work with our social partners to ensure that these and other interventions provide the relief to those who most need it.\nFellow South Africans,\nJust as a harsh fire gives new life to our country’s fynbos, this crisis is an opportunity to build a different, better South Africa.\nRebuilding our country requires a common effort.\nIt requires that all South African take responsibility and play their part.\nLet us work together as government, as business, as labour, as political parties and as all of society to clear away the rubble and lay a new foundation.\nAbove all, let us return this country to the values upon which it was founded.\nOn the day of his release, 31 years ago, Madiba gave his first public address here in Cape Town, where he reminded South Africans that there were difficult days ahead, and that the battle was far from won.\nMadiba said:\n“Now is the time to intensify the Struggle on all fronts.”\n“To relax our efforts now would be a mistake which generations to come will not be able to forgive.”\nIn counting the great cost to our society over the past year, we may be tempted to lose faith.\nBut we can get through this. Because we are a nation of heroes.\nI am referring not to the glorious lineage of Struggle icons, but to the everyday heroes that walk among us, who work hard every day to put food on the table, to keep the company running, and to give support, help and care to our people.\nIt is your resilience that will help this country recover.\nIn addition to the many challenges that beset our people, we have heard that his Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini has not been well in recent days and is admitted to hospital.\nI wish to convey my wishes for the speedy recovery of His Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini ka Bhekuzulu.\nOur thoughts and prayers are with the Royal Household and the Zulu nation at this time.\nIt is our collective wish that Isilo Samabandla Wonke is soon restored to good health.\nAs we prepare for the difficult path ahead, we can draw strength From Maya Angelou’s great poem, Still I rise.\nShe writes:\nOut of the huts of history’s shame\nI rise\nUp from a past that’s rooted in pain\nI rise\nI’m a black ocean, leaping and wide,\nWelling and swelling I bear in the tide.\nLeaving behind nights of terror and fear\nI rise\nInto a daybreak that’s wondrously clear\nI rise\nBringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,\nI am the dream and the hope of the slave.\nI rise I rise I rise.\nPeople of South Africa, it is your country that calls on you to rise.\nLet us march forward together to equality, to growth, to dignity and to recovery.\nMay God bless South Africa and protect her sons and daughters.\nI thank you."}, {"claim": "In South Africa, 2.7 million hectares has been transferred through the land restitution process, since 1995.", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Refuted", "justification": " 3 483 269,02 hectares had been restituted between 1995 and 2018 and an additional 177 623 hectares in the 2018/2019 financial year", "claim_date": "11-2-2021", "speaker": "Cyril Ramaphosa ", "original_claim_url": "https://www.gov.za/speeches/president-cyril-ramaphosa-2021-state-nation-address-11-feb-2021-0000", "fact_checking_article": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210316155254/https://africacheck.org/fact-checks/reports/chickens-and-economy-fact-checking-ramaphosas-sona2021", "reporting_source": "speech", "location_ISO_code": "ZA", "claim_types": ["Numerical Claim"], "fact_checking_strategies": ["Written Evidence", "Numerical Comparison"], "questions": [{"question": "How many hectares of land was restituted between 1995 and 2018?", "answers": [{"answer": "Restitution: \n 3 483 269,02", "answer_type": "Extractive", "source_url": "https://africacheck.org/sites/default/files/media/documents/2021-02/ANNUAL_STATISTICAL_REPORT_FOR_SELECTED_-_Until_2018.pdf", "source_medium": "Web table"}]}, {"question": "How much land was transferred in financial year 2018/19?", "answers": [{"answer": "During the year under review, the CRLR settled claims that resulted in over 177 623 hectares being settled", "answer_type": "Extractive", "source_url": "https://static.pmg.org.za/CRLR_ANNUAL_REPORT_2018-2019_rev_4_Complete.pdf", "source_medium": "PDF"}]}, {"question": "How much land was transferred in financial year 2019/20?", "answers": [{"answer": "No answer could be found.", "answer_type": "Unanswerable", "source_url": "", "source_medium": ""}]}], "orig_claim": "Eskom is the “largest greenhouse gas emitter” in South Africa.", "orig_verdict": "Correct", "fulltext": "State of the Nation Address by President Cyril Ramaphosa, Parliament, Cape Town\nSpeaker of the National Assembly (NA), Ms Thandi Modise,\nChairperson of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP), Mr Amos Masondo,\nDeputy President David Mabuza,\nFormer President Thabo Mbeki and Mrs Mbeki,\nFormer Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka,\nFormer Deputy President Baleka Mbete,\nChief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng and esteemed members of the Judiciary,\nMinisters and Deputy Ministers,\nHonourable members of the NA,\nHonourable members of the NCOP,\nDean of the European Region, representing the diplomatic corps, His Excellency, Mr Beka Dvali,\nDistinguished guests,\nFellow South Africans,\nOn this day, 31 years ago, President Nelson Mandela walked out of the gates of Victor Verster Prison a free person, a living embodiment of the resilience and courage of the South African people.\nFor nearly 40 million years, an extraordinary ecosystem has existed here at the southernmost tip of our continent.\nThe Fynbos Biome, which stretches across the Cape, has among the most distinctive features of any plants found on earth.\nIt can adapt to dry, hot summers and cold rainy winters. It is wondrous in its diversity.\nOur national flower, the Protea, is a species of fynbos.\nWhen I opened the third National Investment Conference last year, I spoke of the Protea's unique properties that in so many ways resemble our national character.\nWhat is most unique and special about fynbos is that to be sustainable and survive, it needs fire.\nAt least once every twenty years, fynbos must burn at extremely high temperatures to allow the ecosystem to be rejuvenated and grow afresh.\nThroughout the summer, the burned foliage lies desolate. But when the autumn rains return, the seeds germinate, and its life cycle begins all over again.\nThe mountains bloom with new life as plants which once seemed lost grow back even stronger than before.\nWe, the people of South Africa, have over the past year experienced a terrible hardship.\nLike a wildfire that sweeps across the mountainous ranges where the fynbos grows, a deadly pandemic has swept across the world, leaving devastation in its path.\nAnd yet, like the hardy fynbos of our native land, we too have proven to be resilient in many ways.\nFor three centuries, we were victims of oppression, dispossession and injustice.\nAnd for three centuries, we resisted.\nThe flames of injustice may have scarred us, but they did not consume us.\nThe rains of democracy brought rejuvenation and the birth of a new nation.\nWe have risen time and time again from the depths of darkness to herald a new day.\nAs we look on the grave damage that this disease has caused, we know that like the fynbos, like all those who have walked this land before us, we will rise again.\nNearly a year has passed since South Africa saw its first case of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19.\nSince then, nearly one-and-a-half million people in our country are known to have been infected by the virus.\nMore than 45 000 people are known to have died.\nBeyond these statistics lies a human story of tragedy and pain.\nThere is no family, no community and no place of work that has not lost someone they knew, worked with and loved.\nIt is also a story of courage and resilience.\nThe resilience of the hospital worker who – day after day, night after night – goes to work to save lives, knowing that they, themselves, are at risk of infection.\nIt is a wonderful account of the courage of the police officer, the soldier, the essential worker, the carer and all those on the frontline, who have kept our country safe, our people fed and our economy going.\nIt is a story of solidarity and compassion.\nOf a nation that has stood together to confront COVID-19 in ways not seen since the early days of our democracy.\nMore than anything else, this crisis has revealed the true character of our remarkable nation.\nIt has revealed a spirit of the people who refused to be defeated.\nIt is this South African spirit that must drive our resolve to build a new and more equal economy and a better, more just society.\nThe year ahead must be a time for change, for progress and for rebirth.\nIt must be a year in which we rise.\nThis is no ordinary year, and this is no ordinary SoNA.\nI will therefore, focus this evening on the foremost, overriding priorities of 2021.\nFirst, we must defeat the coronavirus pandemic.\nSecond, we must accelerate our economic recovery.\nThird, we must implement economic reforms to create sustainable jobs and drive inclusive growth.\nAnd finally, we must fight corruption and strengthen the State.\nIn the coming weeks, we will address the other important elements of government’s programme for the year.\nFundamental to our nation’s recovery is an unrelenting and comprehensive response to overcome the coronavirus.\nSouth Africa has just emerged from the second wave of infections since COVID-19 arrived on our shores in March last year.\nDriven by a new variant of the virus, this second wave was more severe and cost many more lives than the first wave.\nNevertheless, the human cost could have been far greater.\nHad we not moved quickly to restrict movement and activity, had we not prepared our health facilities, had South Africans not observed the basic health protocols, the devastation caused by this virus could have been far worse.\nThis year, we must do everything in our means to contain and overcome this pandemic.\nThis means intensifying our prevention efforts and strengthening our health system.\nIt also means that we must undertake a massive vaccination programme to save lives and dramatically reduce infections across the population.\nEarlier this week, we were informed that one of the vaccines that we had procured, the AstraZeneca vaccine, offers minimal protection from mild to moderate infection by the new variant known as 501Y.v2.\nThis is according to early findings of a study by our scientists and researchers.\nWe applaud these scientists for leading this research and providing new evidence that is vital for guiding our response.\nSince this variant is now the dominant variant in our country, these findings have significant implications for the pace, design and sequencing of our vaccine programme.\nWhile it should not delay the start of the vaccination programme by much, it will affect the choice of vaccines and the manner of their deployment.\nThe first phase of our vaccination programme, which is targeted at health and other frontline workers, will now use the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which has been shown to be effective against the 501Y.V2 variant.\nWe have secured nine million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\nThe first batch, of 80 000 doses, will arrive in the country next week.\nFurther consignments will arrive over the next four weeks, totalling 500 000 Johnson & Johnson vaccines.\nAll provinces have rollout plans in place as the first vaccines come through.\nI wish to thank all provinces for their level of preparedness for this massive undertaking that we are about to embark upon.\nIn addition, we have secured 12 million vaccine doses from the global COVAX facility.\nThis will be complemented by other vaccines that are available to South Africa through the African Union’s (AU) African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team Facility.\nPfizer has committed 20 million vaccine doses, commencing with deliveries at the end of the first quarter.\nWe are continuing our engagements with all the vaccine manufacturers to ensure that we secure sufficient quantities of vaccines that are suitable to our conditions.\nThe health and safety of our people remains our paramount concern.\nAll medication imported into the country is monitored, evaluated, investigated, inspected and registered by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority.\nWe will continue to use the science-driven approach that has served us well since the earliest days of the pandemic.\nThe success of the vaccination programme will rely on active collaboration between all sectors of society.\nWe are greatly encouraged by the active involvement of business, labour, the health industry and medical schemes, in particular, in preparing for this mass vaccination drive.\nAs we have overcome before, we will overcome again and rise.\nBut it is not just this disease that we must defeat.\nWe must overcome poverty, hunger, joblessness and inequality.\nWe must overcome a legacy of exclusion and dispossession that continues to impoverish our people, and which this pandemic has severely worsened.\nWhen I delivered the SoNA in this House last year, none of us could have imagined how – within a matter of weeks – our country and our world would have changed so dramatically.\nOur plans had to be adapted in response to a global emergency.\nBudgets had to be reprioritised and many programmes had to be deferred.\nOver the past year, South Africa has experienced a sharp decline in growth and a significant increase in unemployment.\nPoverty is on the rise. Inequality is deepening.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, our economy was 6% smaller than it was in the last quarter of 2019.\nThere were 1,7 million fewer people employed in the third quarter of 2020 than there were in the first quarter, before the pandemic struck.\nOur unemployment rate now stands at a staggering 30,8%.\nAs a result of the relief measures that we implemented and the phased reopening of the economy, we expect to see a strong recovery in employment by the end of the year.\nAs we worked to contain the spread of the virus, we also had to take extraordinary measures to support ordinary South Africans, assist businesses in distress and protect people’s livelihoods.\nThe Social and Economic Relief Package that we introduced in April last year is the largest intervention of its kind in our history.\nIt identified measures worth a total of R500 billion – or about 10% of our gross domestic product – to provide cash directly to the poorest households, to provide wage support to workers and to provide various forms of relief to struggling businesses.\nA total of 18 million people, or close to one-third of the population, received additional grant payments through these relief measures.\nIt is estimated that this grant lifted more than five million people above the food poverty line, helping to alleviate hunger in a moment of great crisis.\nTo date, more than R57 billion in wage support has been paid to over 4,5 million workers through the special Unemployment Insurance Fund Temporary Employer-Employee Relief Scheme (TERS).\nMore than R1,3 billion has been provided in support mainly for small- and medium-sized businesses.\nIn addition, over R70 billion in tax relief was extended to businesses in distress.\nAround R18,9 billion in loans have been approved for 13 000 businesses through the Loan Guarantee Scheme.\nFellow South Africans,\nIt is nearly four months since I stood here before a joint sitting of this Parliament to present to the nation the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan.\nThis evening, we stand here not to make promises but to report on progress in the implementation of the recovery plan and the priority actions we must take to restore growth and create jobs.\nSince the launch of the plan, we have focused on four priority interventions:\n- a massive rollout of infrastructure throughout the country,\n- a massive increase in local production,\n- an employment stimulus to create jobs and support livelihoods, and\n- the rapid expansion of our energy generation capacity.\nWe announced that we would be embarking on a massive rollout of infrastructure throughout the country.\nWe knew that to achieve this objective we would need to steadily rebuild technical skills within government to prepare and manage large infrastructure projects.\nWe have now developed an infrastructure investment project pipeline worth R340 billion in network industries such as energy, water, transport and telecommunications.\nConstruction has started and progress is being made on a number of these projects.\nSince the announcement of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, we have launched two major human settlements projects that will provide homes to almost 68 000 households in the Gauteng province.\nSimilar human settlements projects are planned in other provinces.\nTwo years ago, I spoke about the dream of building new cities that will enable us to make a break with apartheid’s spatial development.\nNew post-apartheid cities are being conceptualised in a number of places in our country.\nThe Lanseria Smart City, the first new city to be built in a democratic South Africa, is now a reality in the making.\nThe draft masterplan for this smart city – which will become home to between 350 000 to 500 000 people within the next decade – was completed in November 2020 and is now out for public comment.\nProgress is being made on several major water infrastructure projects.\nThese include Phase 2A of the Mokolo and Crocodile River Project, and the uMkhomazi Water Project.\nThe Infrastructure Investment Plan identifies roads projects worth R19 billion covering the spine of the South African road network.\nWork is underway to finalise finance structuring for these projects.\nResources have been committed from the fiscus to support the construction and rehabilitation of the major N1, N2 and N3 highways.\nThese infrastructure projects will lead to the revival of the construction industry and the creation of much-needed jobs.\nThe R100 billion Infrastructure Fund is now in full operation.\nThis fund will blend resources from the fiscus with financing from the private sector and development institutions.\nIts approved project pipeline for 2021 is varied and includes the Student Housing Infrastructure Programme, which aims to provide 300 000 student beds.\nAnother approved project is SA Connect, a programme to roll out broadband to schools, hospitals, police stations and other government facilities.\nThe second priority intervention of the recovery plan is to support a massive increase in local production and to make South African exports globally competitive.\nThis will encourage greater investment by the private sector in productive activity.\nKey to this plan is a renewed commitment from government, business and organised labour to buy local.\nThis commitment should lead to increased local production, which will lead to the revival of our manufacturing industry.\nAll social partners that participated in the development of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, as part of our social compact, have agreed to work together to reduce our reliance on imports by 20% over the next five years.\nThey have identified 42 products – ranging from edible oils to furniture, fruit concentrates, personal protective equipment, steel products and green economy inputs – that can be sourced locally.\nIf we achieve our target, we will significantly expand our productive economy, potentially returning more than R200 billion to the country’s annual output.\nLast year, we undertook to create a larger market for small businesses and designate 1 000 locally produced products that must be procured from Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs).\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic forced the closure of global value chains, we have been able to speed up this initiative as the local supply chains became open for locally manufactured products.\nTo this end, Cabinet approved the SMME-Focused Localisation Policy Framework which identified the 1 000 products.\nFurthermore, the departments of Small Business Development and Trade, Industry and Competition are supporting SMMEs to access larger domestic and international markets.\nThese efforts are supported by robust manufacturing support programmes.\nIn the SoNA last year, I said that our vision for industrialisation is underpinned by sector master plans to rejuvenate and grow key industries.\nFour master plans that have been completed and signed to date – which are part of the social compact between labour, business, government and communities – have already had an impact in their respective industries.\nThrough the implementation of the Poultry Master Plan, the industry has invested R800 million to upgrade production.\nSouth Africa now produces an additional one million chickens every week.\nThe Sugar Master Plan was signed during the lockdown, with a commitment from large users of sugar to procure at least 80% of their sugar needs from local growers.\nThrough the implementation of the plan, last year saw a rise in local production and a decline in imported sugar, creating stability for an industry which employs some 85 000 workers.\nSupport for black small-scale farmers is being stepped up, with a large beverage producer committing to expand their procurement sharply.\nSince the signing of the Clothing, Textile, Footwear and Leather Masterplan in November 2019, the industry has invested more than half a billion rand to expand local manufacturing facilities, including SMMEs.\nWe have worked closely with the auto sector to help it weather the pandemic.\nBy the end of the year, the sector had recovered around 70% of its normal annual production, in difficult circumstances.\nLast week, the Ford Motor Company announced a R16 billion investment to expand their manufacturing facility in Tshwane for the next generation Ford Ranger bakkie.\nThis investment will support the growth of around 12 small and medium enterprises in automotive component manufacturing.\nNearly half of the procurement spend on construction of the bulk earthworks and top structure at the Tshwane Special Economic Zone during this phase is expected to be allocated for SMMEs, an amount equal to R1,7 billion in procurement opportunities.\nToyota has invested in its KwaZulu-Natal facility to start production of the first generation of hybrid electric vehicles to come off a South African assembly line.\nThis follows investment announcements by Nissan, Mercedes Benz and Isuzu in expanded production facilities, all of which cement South Africa’s position as a global player in auto manufacturing.\nThis year, our focus will be on getting the industry back to full production, implementing the Black Industrialist Fund and working on a new platform for expanded auto trade with the rest of the continent.\nThis will be part of our concerted effort to boost the manufacturing sector.\nThis year, we will begin to harness the opportunities presented by the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which came into operation on 1 January, following the adoption of the Johannesburg Declaration by the AU.\nThe AfCFTA provides a platform for South African businesses to expand into markets across the continent, and for South Africa to position itself as a gateway to the continent.\nTo address the deep inequalities in our society, we must accelerate the implementation of broad-based black economic empowerment policies on ownership, control and management of the economy.\nLast year, government agreed to landmark deals with companies that will advance black economic empowerment by transferring ownership to their workers.\nIn November last year, we held our third South Africa Investment Conference to review the implementation of previous commitments and to generate new investment into our economy.\nEven under difficult economic circumstances, the investment conference managed to raise some R108 billion in additional investment commitments.\nTogether with investment confirmed from the two previous conferences, we have now received R773 billion in investment commitments towards our five-year target of R1,2 trillion.\nFirms have reported that some R183 billion of these investments has already flowed into projects that benefit the South African economy.\nThis shows that our country is still an attractive investment destination for both local and offshore companies.\nWe have worked to facilitate investment by increasing the ease of doing business, including making it easier to start a business.\nIn the past year, more than 125 000 new companies were registered through the BizPortal platform, completing their registration in just a matter of hours from the comfort of their homes or offices.\nWe are making it easier for business to do business.\nOur third priority intervention is an employment stimulus to create jobs and support livelihoods.\nThe largest numbers of jobs will be created by the private sector in a number of industries as the economy recovers.\nWe continue to work in a social compact with the private sector to create a more conducive environment for them to be able to create jobs.\nOur compact with the private sector is underpinned by a clear commitment to grow our economy and to create jobs.\nHowever, the public sector has a responsibility to stimulate job creation; both through its policies and through direct job creation opportunities.\nThe Presidential Employment Stimulus is one of the most significant expansions of public and social employment in South Africa’s history.\nBy the end of January 2021, over 430 000 opportunities were already supported through the stimulus.\nA further 180 000 opportunities are currently in the recruitment process.\nThese opportunities are in areas like education, arts and culture, global business services, early childhood development (ECD), and small-scale and subsistence farming.\nIt involves environmental programmes such as the clearing of alien trees, wetland rehabilitation, fire prevention, and cleaning and greening across all municipalities.\nThese programmes are about real lives and real livelihoods.\nNearly half a million people are now receiving an income, developing new skills and contributing to their community and the country’s economy.\nWe will continue to support employment for as long as it is necessary while the labour market recovers, even as we work to promote stronger and more resilient growth in the private sector.\nIn the SoNA last year, in response to the huge challenge our country faces of youth unemployment, I announced that the National Youth Development Agency and the Department of Small Business Development would provide grant funding and business support to 1 000 young entrepreneurs within 100 days.\nWhile the programme had to be put on hold due to the coronavirus restrictions, it nevertheless managed to reach its target of 1 000 businesses by International Youth Day on 12 August 2020.\nThis provides a firm foundation for our efforts to support 15 000 start-ups by 2024.\nLast year, we said we would establish the National Pathway Management Network to provide support and opportunities to young people across the country.\nI want to encourage every young South African to join the more than 1,2 million people who are already in the network, and take their next steps to a better future.\nOf the many hardships our people had to experience last year, schooling disruption placed a huge burden on learners, teachers and families.\nDespite this, they persevered.\nIt is our priority for this year to regain lost time and improve educational outcomes, from the early years through to high school and post-school education and training.\nThe fourth priority intervention of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan is to rapidly expand energy generation capacity.\nRestoring Eskom to operational and financial health and accelerating its restructuring process is central to this objective.\nEskom has been restructured into three separate entities for generation, transmission and distribution.\nThis will lay the foundations for an efficient, modern and competitive energy system.\nEskom is making substantial progress with its intensive maintenance and operational excellence programmes to improve the reliability of its coal fleet.\nWe are working closely with Eskom on proposals to improve its financial position, manage its debt and reduce its dependence on the fiscus.\nThis requires a review of the tariff path to ensure that it reflects all reasonable costs and measures to resolve the problem of municipal debt.\nIn December 2020, government and its social partners signed the historic Eskom Social Compact, which outlines the necessary actions we must take, collectively and as individual constituencies, to meet the country’s energy needs now and into the future.\nOver the last year, we have taken action to urgently and substantially increase generation capacity in addition to what Eskom generates:\n- The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy will soon be announcing the successful bids for 2 000 megawatts (MW) of emergency power.\n- The necessary regulations have been amended and the requirements clarified for municipalities to buy power from independent power producers. Systems are being put in place to support qualifying municipalities.\n- Government will soon be initiating the procurement of an additional 11 800 MW of power from renewable energy, natural gas, battery storage and coal in line with the Integrated Resource Plan 2019.\nDespite this work, Eskom estimates that, without additional capacity, there will be an electricity supply shortfall of between 4 000 and 6 000 MW over the next five years, as old coal-fired power stations reach their end of life.\nAs part of the measures to address this shortfall, we will in the coming weeks issue a request for proposals for 2 600 MW from wind and solar energy as part of Bid Window 5.\nThis will be followed by another bid window in August 2021.\nRecent analysis suggests that easing the licensing requirements for new embedded generation projects could unlock up to 5 000 MW of additional capacity and help to ease the impact of load shedding.\nWe will therefore amend Schedule 2 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 2006 (Act 4 of 2006) within the next three months to increase the licensing threshold for embedded generation.\nThis will include consultation among key stakeholders on the level at which the new threshold should be set and the finalisation of the necessary enabling frameworks.\nEskom has already started work to expedite its commercial and technical processes to allow this additional capacity onto the grid without undue delay.\nAs we mobilise all of the resources at our disposal to support economic recovery, we cannot lose sight of the threat that climate change poses to our environmental health, socioeconomic development and economic growth.\nWe are, therefore, working to fulfil our commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement which include the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\nEskom, our largest greenhouse gas emitter, has committed in principle to net zero emission by 2050 and to increase its renewable capacity.\nEskom will be looking to partner with investors to repurpose and repower part of its coal fleet.\nThis will be done in a way that stimulates investment, local economic activity and local manufacturing, as part of a just transition.\nOur work on climate change will be guided by the Presidential Coordinating Commission on Climate Change, which is meeting for the first time this month.\nThe commission will work on a plan for a just transition to a low-carbon economy and climate resilient society.\nWe will not achieve higher rates of growth and employment if we do not implement structural economic reforms.\nThese reforms are necessary to reduce costs and barriers to entry, increase competition, stimulate new investment and create space for new entrants in the market.\nThis work is being driven through Operation Vulindlela, which involves a team in the National Treasury and the President’s office.\nOperation Vulindlela is focusing on reforms in the electricity, water, telecommunications and transport sectors, as well as reforms to our visa and immigration regime.\nThe completion of digital migration is vital to our ability to effectively harness the enormous opportunities presented by technological change.\nAfter many delays, we will begin the phased switch-off of our analogue television transmitters from next month.\nIt is anticipated that this process, which will be done province-by-province, will be completed by the end of March 2022.\nThe process for the licensing of high-demand spectrum is at an advanced stage.\nWe hope that the ongoing litigation on the licensing matter will provide legal certainty and will not unduly delay the spectrum auction process.\nIn the water sector, we are working through Operation Vulindlela to ensure that water license applications are finalised within the revised timeframe of 90 days; and to revive the Green Drop and Blue Drop programmes to strengthen water quality monitoring.\nWe will finalise and implement the revised Raw Water Pricing Strategy, and accelerate the establishment of a national water resources infrastructure agency.\nOur ability to compete in global markets depends on the efficiency of our ports and rail network.\nWe are repositioning Durban as a hub port for the Southern Hemisphere and developing Ngqura as the container terminal of choice.\nThe rail corridor from Gauteng is being extended to enable the export of vehicles through Port Elizabeth.\nThese are crucial steps to move freight from road to rail and increase the competitiveness of the rail system.\nWork is underway with the relevant departments to reform our visa and immigration regime to attract skills and grow the tourism sector.\nAs international travel starts to recover in the wake of COVID-19, we will undertake a full rollout of eVisas to visitors from China, India, Nigeria, Kenya and 10 other countries.\nThe revised list of critical skills will be published for public comment by the Department of Home Affairs, within one week, to ensure that the final version reflects the skills needed by the economy.\nThe momentum that Operation Vulindlela has already built, and the support that it has received across government, shows that we are serious about reform.\nWe will continue to work relentlessly and without pause to create a more modern, efficient and competitive economy that is more open to all South Africans.\nTo support our reform process, the Presidential State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Council has outlined a clear set of reforms that will enable these vital public companies to fulfil their mandate for growth and development.\nOverarching legislation for state-owned companies will be tabled in Cabinet this financial year and in Parliament in the next the financial year.\nA centralised SOE model is being implemented this financial year, which will ensure a standardised governance, financial management and operational performance framework for all SOEs.\nThe mandates of all SOEs are being re-evaluated to ensure that they are responsive to the country’s needs and the implementation of the National Development Plan.\nIn the midst of the economic damage caused by COVID-19, South Africa’s agricultural sector has performed remarkably well.\nIn 2020, we became the world’s second-largest exporter of citrus, with strong export growth in wine, maize, nuts, deciduous fruit and sugar cane.\nThe favourable weather conditions in 2020 and the beginning of 2021 mean that agriculture is likely to grow in the near term.\nThis provides an opportunity for further public-private partnership in agriculture to promote transformation and ensure sustainable growth.\nIt is an opportunity to accelerate land redistribution through a variety of instruments such as land restitution and expropriation of land in order to boost agricultural output.\nTo date, government has redistributed over five million hectares (ha) of land, totalling around 5 500 farms, to more than 300 000 beneficiaries.\nThis is in addition to the land restitution process, which has benefited over two million land claimants and resulted in the transfer of around 2,7 million ha.\nWe are also pursuing programmes to assist smallholder and emerging farmers with market access, to develop skills across the entire agricultural value chain and increase the number of commercial black farmers.\nDuring the course of the next financial year, we will establish a land and agrarian reform agency to fast-track land reform.\nThe Public Service is at the coalface of government, and lack of professionalism does not just impact service delivery; it also dents public confidence.\nAdvancing honesty, ethics and integrity in the Public Service is critical if we are to build a capable state.\nThrough the National School of Government, we continue to roll out courses and training programmes for government officials from entry level to senior management and the Executive.\nIn October last year, I signed off on ministerial performance agreements with all Ministers, which have now been published online.\nThis will enhance accountability and focused performance by members of the Executive.\nWe remain on course to build a capable and professional civil service that delivers on its mandate and is accountable to the South African people.\nWe are proceeding with our efforts to strengthen the local government infrastructure and accelerate service delivery through the District Development Model.\nThe model brings all three spheres of government to focus on key priorities and implementation of critical high impact projects.\nWorking with both public and private sector partners, government is implementing a range of measures to support municipalities to address inadequate and inconsistent service delivery in areas such water provision, infrastructure build and maintenance.\nWe are focusing on the appointment of properly qualified officials at a local level to ensure effective management and provision of services.\nAs we prepare for local government elections, which are due take place this year, we will need to adjust to the conditions forced upon us by COVID-19 to ensure that the people of this country can determine who represents them at this crucial level of government.\nFellow South Africans,\nCorruption is one of the greatest impediments to the country’s growth and development.\nThe revelations from the Zondo Commission of Inquiry lay bare the extent of state capture and related corruption.\nTestimony at the commission has shown how the criminal justice system was compromised and weakened.\nIt is, therefore, vital that we sustain the momentum of the rebuilding effort that we began three years ago.\nThere has been great progress in turning around law enforcement bodies.\nCritical leadership positions have been filled with capable, experienced and trustworthy professionals.\nThere is improved cooperation and sharing of resources between the respective law enforcement agencies, enabling a more integrated approach to investigations and prosecutions.\nWe have started implementation of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy, which lays the basis for a comprehensive and integrated society-wide response to corruption.\nWe will shortly be appointing members of the National Anti-Corruption Advisory Council, which is a multi-sectoral body that will oversee the initial implementation of the strategy and the establishment of an independent statutory anti-corruption body that reports to Parliament.\nWhen reports started to surface last year about possible fraud and corruption in the procurement of COVID-19-related goods and services, we acted decisively to put a stop to these practices, to investigate all allegations and to act against those responsible.\nWe established a fusion centre, which brings together key law enforcement agencies to share information and resources.\nThe fusion centre has brought many cases to trial and preserved or recovered millions of rands in public funds.\nThe Special Investigating Unit (SIU) was authorised to investigate allegations of unlawful conduct with respect to COVID-19 procurement by all state bodies during the National State of Disaster.\nAs it reported last week, the SIU has finalised investigations into 164 contracts with a total value of R3,5 billion.\nIn a significant advance for transparency and accountability, the Political Party Funding Act, 2018 (Act 6 of 2018) will come into operation on 1 April this year.\nThis will regulate public and private funding of political parties. Among other things, it requires the disclosure of donations to parties and establishes two funds that will enable represented political parties to undertake their programmes.\nCrime and violence continue to undermine people’s sense of safety and security.\nTackling crime is central to the success of our recovery.\nCrimes like cable theft, railway infrastructure vandalism, land invasions, construction site disruptions and attacks on truck drivers hamper economic activity and discourage investment.\nWe have taken steps and will continue to stop these crimes and deal with those responsible in terms of the law.\nTask teams have been set up in a number of provinces to deal with extortion and violence on sites of economic activity.\nWe are also fast-tracking the implementation and capacitation of the Border Management Agency to curb illegal immigration and cross-border crime.\nEnding gender-based violence (GBV) is imperative if we lay claim to being a society rooted in equality and non-sexism.\nWhen I launched the National Strategic Plan on Gender-Based Violence and Femicide (GBVF) in April last year, I made a promise to the women and children of this country that we were going to strengthen the Criminal Justice System to prevent them being traumatised again, and to ensure that perpetrators face justice.\nTo give effect to this, three key pieces of legislation were introduced in Parliament last year to make the criminal justice system more effective in combatting GBV.\nTo ensure that perpetrators are brought to book, we are making progress in reducing the backlog of GBV cases.\nWe continue to provide care and support to survivors of GBV.\nIn the SoNA last year, I said that we would prioritise the economic empowerment of women.\nLast year, Cabinet approved a policy that 40% of public procurement should go to women-owned businesses and entities.\nSeveral departments have started implementing this policy and are making progress.\nLast week, we also launched a groundbreaking private sector-led GBVF Response Fund.\nSeveral South African companies and global philanthropies made pledges to the value of R128 million.\nOver the next three years, government will allocate approximately R12 billion to implement the various components of the National Strategic Plan.\nGBV will only end when everyone takes responsibility for doing so in their homes, in their communities, in their workplaces, in their places of worship and in their schools.\nEqually, we need to give attention to issues affecting children, including improving school-readiness, ECD planning and funding, protection against preventable diseases, policy reform around child welfare and reducing violence against children.\nIn the year ahead, we are also going to forge ahead with efforts to provide greater opportunities for persons with disabilities to participate in the economy and in society in general.\nAs we rebuild our economy in the midst of a pandemic, it is necessary that we continue – within our means – to provide support to those businesses and individuals that continue to be most affected.\nBusinesses in several sectors are still struggling and many families continue to suffer as the job market slowly recovers.\nOver the last few months, we have had ongoing discussions with our social partners in business, labour and community-based organisations, who proposed an extension of some of the social and economic support.\nWe have, therefore, decided to extend the period for the Special COVID-19 Grant of R350 by a further three months.\nThis has proven to be an effective and efficient short-term measure to reduce the immediate impact on the livelihoods of poor South Africans.\nWe have also decided to extend the COVID-19 TERS benefit until 15 March 2021, only for those sectors that have not been able to open and operate.\nThe conditions of this extension and the sectors to be included will be announced after consultations with social partners at the National Economic Development and Labour Council.\nThe National Treasury will work with its partners and stakeholders on improvements to the Loan Guarantee Scheme so that it better addresses the realities of SMMEs and other businesses as they strive to recover.\nWe will work with our social partners to ensure that these and other interventions provide the relief to those who most need it.\nFellow South Africans,\nJust as a harsh fire gives new life to our country’s fynbos, this crisis is an opportunity to build a different, better South Africa.\nRebuilding our country requires a common effort.\nIt requires that all South African take responsibility and play their part.\nLet us work together as government, as business, as labour, as political parties and as all of society to clear away the rubble and lay a new foundation.\nAbove all, let us return this country to the values upon which it was founded.\nOn the day of his release, 31 years ago, Madiba gave his first public address here in Cape Town, where he reminded South Africans that there were difficult days ahead, and that the battle was far from won.\nMadiba said:\n“Now is the time to intensify the Struggle on all fronts.”\n“To relax our efforts now would be a mistake which generations to come will not be able to forgive.”\nIn counting the great cost to our society over the past year, we may be tempted to lose faith.\nBut we can get through this. Because we are a nation of heroes.\nI am referring not to the glorious lineage of Struggle icons, but to the everyday heroes that walk among us, who work hard every day to put food on the table, to keep the company running, and to give support, help and care to our people.\nIt is your resilience that will help this country recover.\nIn addition to the many challenges that beset our people, we have heard that his Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini has not been well in recent days and is admitted to hospital.\nI wish to convey my wishes for the speedy recovery of His Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini ka Bhekuzulu.\nOur thoughts and prayers are with the Royal Household and the Zulu nation at this time.\nIt is our collective wish that Isilo Samabandla Wonke is soon restored to good health.\nAs we prepare for the difficult path ahead, we can draw strength From Maya Angelou’s great poem, Still I rise.\nShe writes:\nOut of the huts of history’s shame\nI rise\nUp from a past that’s rooted in pain\nI rise\nI’m a black ocean, leaping and wide,\nWelling and swelling I bear in the tide.\nLeaving behind nights of terror and fear\nI rise\nInto a daybreak that’s wondrously clear\nI rise\nBringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,\nI am the dream and the hope of the slave.\nI rise I rise I rise.\nPeople of South Africa, it is your country that calls on you to rise.\nLet us march forward together to equality, to growth, to dignity and to recovery.\nMay God bless South Africa and protect her sons and daughters.\nI thank you."}, {"claim": "Through the implementation of the poultry master plan the poultry industry has invested R800 million to upgrade production.

It is wondrous in its diversity.\nOur national flower, the Protea, is a species of fynbos.\nWhen I opened the third National Investment Conference last year, I spoke of the Protea's unique properties that in so many ways resemble our national character.\nWhat is most unique and special about fynbos is that to be sustainable and survive, it needs fire.\nAt least once every twenty years, fynbos must burn at extremely high temperatures to allow the ecosystem to be rejuvenated and grow afresh.\nThroughout the summer, the burned foliage lies desolate. But when the autumn rains return, the seeds germinate, and its life cycle begins all over again.\nThe mountains bloom with new life as plants which once seemed lost grow back even stronger than before.\nWe, the people of South Africa, have over the past year experienced a terrible hardship.\nLike a wildfire that sweeps across the mountainous ranges where the fynbos grows, a deadly pandemic has swept across the world, leaving devastation in its path.\nAnd yet, like the hardy fynbos of our native land, we too have proven to be resilient in many ways.\nFor three centuries, we were victims of oppression, dispossession and injustice.\nAnd for three centuries, we resisted.\nThe flames of injustice may have scarred us, but they did not consume us.\nThe rains of democracy brought rejuvenation and the birth of a new nation.\nWe have risen time and time again from the depths of darkness to herald a new day.\nAs we look on the grave damage that this disease has caused, we know that like the fynbos, like all those who have walked this land before us, we will rise again.\nNearly a year has passed since South Africa saw its first case of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19.\nSince then, nearly one-and-a-half million people in our country are known to have been infected by the virus.\nMore than 45 000 people are known to have died.\nBeyond these statistics lies a human story of tragedy and pain.\nThere is no family, no community and no place of work that has not lost someone they knew, worked with and loved.\nIt is also a story of courage and resilience.\nThe resilience of the hospital worker who – day after day, night after night – goes to work to save lives, knowing that they, themselves, are at risk of infection.\nIt is a wonderful account of the courage of the police officer, the soldier, the essential worker, the carer and all those on the frontline, who have kept our country safe, our people fed and our economy going.\nIt is a story of solidarity and compassion.\nOf a nation that has stood together to confront COVID-19 in ways not seen since the early days of our democracy.\nMore than anything else, this crisis has revealed the true character of our remarkable nation.\nIt has revealed a spirit of the people who refused to be defeated.\nIt is this South African spirit that must drive our resolve to build a new and more equal economy and a better, more just society.\nThe year ahead must be a time for change, for progress and for rebirth.\nIt must be a year in which we rise.\nThis is no ordinary year, and this is no ordinary SoNA.\nI will therefore, focus this evening on the foremost, overriding priorities of 2021.\nFirst, we must defeat the coronavirus pandemic.\nSecond, we must accelerate our economic recovery.\nThird, we must implement economic reforms to create sustainable jobs and drive inclusive growth.\nAnd finally, we must fight corruption and strengthen the State.\nIn the coming weeks, we will address the other important elements of government’s programme for the year.\nFundamental to our nation’s recovery is an unrelenting and comprehensive response to overcome the coronavirus.\nSouth Africa has just emerged from the second wave of infections since COVID-19 arrived on our shores in March last year.\nDriven by a new variant of the virus, this second wave was more severe and cost many more lives than the first wave.\nNevertheless, the human cost could have been far greater.\nHad we not moved quickly to restrict movement and activity, had we not prepared our health facilities, had South Africans not observed the basic health protocols, the devastation caused by this virus could have been far worse.\nThis year, we must do everything in our means to contain and overcome this pandemic.\nThis means intensifying our prevention efforts and strengthening our health system.\nIt also means that we must undertake a massive vaccination programme to save lives and dramatically reduce infections across the population.\nEarlier this week, we were informed that one of the vaccines that we had procured, the AstraZeneca vaccine, offers minimal protection from mild to moderate infection by the new variant known as 501Y.v2.\nThis is according to early findings of a study by our scientists and researchers.\nWe applaud these scientists for leading this research and providing new evidence that is vital for guiding our response.\nSince this variant is now the dominant variant in our country, these findings have significant implications for the pace, design and sequencing of our vaccine programme.\nWhile it should not delay the start of the vaccination programme by much, it will affect the choice of vaccines and the manner of their deployment.\nThe first phase of our vaccination programme, which is targeted at health and other frontline workers, will now use the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which has been shown to be effective against the 501Y.V2 variant.\nWe have secured nine million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\nThe first batch, of 80 000 doses, will arrive in the country next week.\nFurther consignments will arrive over the next four weeks, totalling 500 000 Johnson & Johnson vaccines.\nAll provinces have rollout plans in place as the first vaccines come through.\nI wish to thank all provinces for their level of preparedness for this massive undertaking that we are about to embark upon.\nIn addition, we have secured 12 million vaccine doses from the global COVAX facility.\nThis will be complemented by other vaccines that are available to South Africa through the African Union’s (AU) African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team Facility.\nPfizer has committed 20 million vaccine doses, commencing with deliveries at the end of the first quarter.\nWe are continuing our engagements with all the vaccine manufacturers to ensure that we secure sufficient quantities of vaccines that are suitable to our conditions.\nThe health and safety of our people remains our paramount concern.\nAll medication imported into the country is monitored, evaluated, investigated, inspected and registered by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority.\nWe will continue to use the science-driven approach that has served us well since the earliest days of the pandemic.\nThe success of the vaccination programme will rely on active collaboration between all sectors of society.\nWe are greatly encouraged by the active involvement of business, labour, the health industry and medical schemes, in particular, in preparing for this mass vaccination drive.\nAs we have overcome before, we will overcome again and rise.\nBut it is not just this disease that we must defeat.\nWe must overcome poverty, hunger, joblessness and inequality.\nWe must overcome a legacy of exclusion and dispossession that continues to impoverish our people, and which this pandemic has severely worsened.\nWhen I delivered the SoNA in this House last year, none of us could have imagined how – within a matter of weeks – our country and our world would have changed so dramatically.\nOur plans had to be adapted in response to a global emergency.\nBudgets had to be reprioritised and many programmes had to be deferred.\nOver the past year, South Africa has experienced a sharp decline in growth and a significant increase in unemployment.\nPoverty is on the rise. Inequality is deepening.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, our economy was 6% smaller than it was in the last quarter of 2019.\nThere were 1,7 million fewer people employed in the third quarter of 2020 than there were in the first quarter, before the pandemic struck.\nOur unemployment rate now stands at a staggering 30,8%.\nAs a result of the relief measures that we implemented and the phased reopening of the economy, we expect to see a strong recovery in employment by the end of the year.\nAs we worked to contain the spread of the virus, we also had to take extraordinary measures to support ordinary South Africans, assist businesses in distress and protect people’s livelihoods.\nThe Social and Economic Relief Package that we introduced in April last year is the largest intervention of its kind in our history.\nIt identified measures worth a total of R500 billion – or about 10% of our gross domestic product – to provide cash directly to the poorest households, to provide wage support to workers and to provide various forms of relief to struggling businesses.\nA total of 18 million people, or close to one-third of the population, received additional grant payments through these relief measures.\nIt is estimated that this grant lifted more than five million people above the food poverty line, helping to alleviate hunger in a moment of great crisis.\nTo date, more than R57 billion in wage support has been paid to over 4,5 million workers through the special Unemployment Insurance Fund Temporary Employer-Employee Relief Scheme (TERS).\nMore than R1,3 billion has been provided in support mainly for small- and medium-sized businesses.\nIn addition, over R70 billion in tax relief was extended to businesses in distress.\nAround R18,9 billion in loans have been approved for 13 000 businesses through the Loan Guarantee Scheme.\nFellow South Africans,\nIt is nearly four months since I stood here before a joint sitting of this Parliament to present to the nation the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan.\nThis evening, we stand here not to make promises but to report on progress in the implementation of the recovery plan and the priority actions we must take to restore growth and create jobs.\nSince the launch of the plan, we have focused on four priority interventions:\n- a massive rollout of infrastructure throughout the country,\n- a massive increase in local production,\n- an employment stimulus to create jobs and support livelihoods, and\n- the rapid expansion of our energy generation capacity.\nWe announced that we would be embarking on a massive rollout of infrastructure throughout the country.\nWe knew that to achieve this objective we would need to steadily rebuild technical skills within government to prepare and manage large infrastructure projects.\nWe have now developed an infrastructure investment project pipeline worth R340 billion in network industries such as energy, water, transport and telecommunications.\nConstruction has started and progress is being made on a number of these projects.\nSince the announcement of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, we have launched two major human settlements projects that will provide homes to almost 68 000 households in the Gauteng province.\nSimilar human settlements projects are planned in other provinces.\nTwo years ago, I spoke about the dream of building new cities that will enable us to make a break with apartheid’s spatial development.\nNew post-apartheid cities are being conceptualised in a number of places in our country.\nThe Lanseria Smart City, the first new city to be built in a democratic South Africa, is now a reality in the making.\nThe draft masterplan for this smart city – which will become home to between 350 000 to 500 000 people within the next decade – was completed in November 2020 and is now out for public comment.\nProgress is being made on several major water infrastructure projects.\nThese include Phase 2A of the Mokolo and Crocodile River Project, and the uMkhomazi Water Project.\nThe Infrastructure Investment Plan identifies roads projects worth R19 billion covering the spine of the South African road network.\nWork is underway to finalise finance structuring for these projects.\nResources have been committed from the fiscus to support the construction and rehabilitation of the major N1, N2 and N3 highways.\nThese infrastructure projects will lead to the revival of the construction industry and the creation of much-needed jobs.\nThe R100 billion Infrastructure Fund is now in full operation.\nThis fund will blend resources from the fiscus with financing from the private sector and development institutions.\nIts approved project pipeline for 2021 is varied and includes the Student Housing Infrastructure Programme, which aims to provide 300 000 student beds.\nAnother approved project is SA Connect, a programme to roll out broadband to schools, hospitals, police stations and other government facilities.\nThe second priority intervention of the recovery plan is to support a massive increase in local production and to make South African exports globally competitive.\nThis will encourage greater investment by the private sector in productive activity.\nKey to this plan is a renewed commitment from government, business and organised labour to buy local.\nThis commitment should lead to increased local production, which will lead to the revival of our manufacturing industry.\nAll social partners that participated in the development of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, as part of our social compact, have agreed to work together to reduce our reliance on imports by 20% over the next five years.\nThey have identified 42 products – ranging from edible oils to furniture, fruit concentrates, personal protective equipment, steel products and green economy inputs – that can be sourced locally.\nIf we achieve our target, we will significantly expand our productive economy, potentially returning more than R200 billion to the country’s annual output.\nLast year, we undertook to create a larger market for small businesses and designate 1 000 locally produced products that must be procured from Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs).\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic forced the closure of global value chains, we have been able to speed up this initiative as the local supply chains became open for locally manufactured products.\nTo this end, Cabinet approved the SMME-Focused Localisation Policy Framework which identified the 1 000 products.\nFurthermore, the departments of Small Business Development and Trade, Industry and Competition are supporting SMMEs to access larger domestic and international markets.\nThese efforts are supported by robust manufacturing support programmes.\nIn the SoNA last year, I said that our vision for industrialisation is underpinned by sector master plans to rejuvenate and grow key industries.\nFour master plans that have been completed and signed to date – which are part of the social compact between labour, business, government and communities – have already had an impact in their respective industries.\nThrough the implementation of the Poultry Master Plan, the industry has invested R800 million to upgrade production.\nSouth Africa now produces an additional one million chickens every week.\nThe Sugar Master Plan was signed during the lockdown, with a commitment from large users of sugar to procure at least 80% of their sugar needs from local growers.\nThrough the implementation of the plan, last year saw a rise in local production and a decline in imported sugar, creating stability for an industry which employs some 85 000 workers.\nSupport for black small-scale farmers is being stepped up, with a large beverage producer committing to expand their procurement sharply.\nSince the signing of the Clothing, Textile, Footwear and Leather Masterplan in November 2019, the industry has invested more than half a billion rand to expand local manufacturing facilities, including SMMEs.\nWe have worked closely with the auto sector to help it weather the pandemic.\nBy the end of the year, the sector had recovered around 70% of its normal annual production, in difficult circumstances.\nLast week, the Ford Motor Company announced a R16 billion investment to expand their manufacturing facility in Tshwane for the next generation Ford Ranger bakkie.\nThis investment will support the growth of around 12 small and medium enterprises in automotive component manufacturing.\nNearly half of the procurement spend on construction of the bulk earthworks and top structure at the Tshwane Special Economic Zone during this phase is expected to be allocated for SMMEs, an amount equal to R1,7 billion in procurement opportunities.\nToyota has invested in its KwaZulu-Natal facility to start production of the first generation of hybrid electric vehicles to come off a South African assembly line.\nThis follows investment announcements by Nissan, Mercedes Benz and Isuzu in expanded production facilities, all of which cement South Africa’s position as a global player in auto manufacturing.\nThis year, our focus will be on getting the industry back to full production, implementing the Black Industrialist Fund and working on a new platform for expanded auto trade with the rest of the continent.\nThis will be part of our concerted effort to boost the manufacturing sector.\nThis year, we will begin to harness the opportunities presented by the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which came into operation on 1 January, following the adoption of the Johannesburg Declaration by the AU.\nThe AfCFTA provides a platform for South African businesses to expand into markets across the continent, and for South Africa to position itself as a gateway to the continent.\nTo address the deep inequalities in our society, we must accelerate the implementation of broad-based black economic empowerment policies on ownership, control and management of the economy.\nLast year, government agreed to landmark deals with companies that will advance black economic empowerment by transferring ownership to their workers.\nIn November last year, we held our third South Africa Investment Conference to review the implementation of previous commitments and to generate new investment into our economy.\nEven under difficult economic circumstances, the investment conference managed to raise some R108 billion in additional investment commitments.\nTogether with investment confirmed from the two previous conferences, we have now received R773 billion in investment commitments towards our five-year target of R1,2 trillion.\nFirms have reported that some R183 billion of these investments has already flowed into projects that benefit the South African economy.\nThis shows that our country is still an attractive investment destination for both local and offshore companies.\nWe have worked to facilitate investment by increasing the ease of doing business, including making it easier to start a business.\nIn the past year, more than 125 000 new companies were registered through the BizPortal platform, completing their registration in just a matter of hours from the comfort of their homes or offices.\nWe are making it easier for business to do business.\nOur third priority intervention is an employment stimulus to create jobs and support livelihoods.\nThe largest numbers of jobs will be created by the private sector in a number of industries as the economy recovers.\nWe continue to work in a social compact with the private sector to create a more conducive environment for them to be able to create jobs.\nOur compact with the private sector is underpinned by a clear commitment to grow our economy and to create jobs.\nHowever, the public sector has a responsibility to stimulate job creation; both through its policies and through direct job creation opportunities.\nThe Presidential Employment Stimulus is one of the most significant expansions of public and social employment in South Africa’s history.\nBy the end of January 2021, over 430 000 opportunities were already supported through the stimulus.\nA further 180 000 opportunities are currently in the recruitment process.\nThese opportunities are in areas like education, arts and culture, global business services, early childhood development (ECD), and small-scale and subsistence farming.\nIt involves environmental programmes such as the clearing of alien trees, wetland rehabilitation, fire prevention, and cleaning and greening across all municipalities.\nThese programmes are about real lives and real livelihoods.\nNearly half a million people are now receiving an income, developing new skills and contributing to their community and the country’s economy.\nWe will continue to support employment for as long as it is necessary while the labour market recovers, even as we work to promote stronger and more resilient growth in the private sector.\nIn the SoNA last year, in response to the huge challenge our country faces of youth unemployment, I announced that the National Youth Development Agency and the Department of Small Business Development would provide grant funding and business support to 1 000 young entrepreneurs within 100 days.\nWhile the programme had to be put on hold due to the coronavirus restrictions, it nevertheless managed to reach its target of 1 000 businesses by International Youth Day on 12 August 2020.\nThis provides a firm foundation for our efforts to support 15 000 start-ups by 2024.\nLast year, we said we would establish the National Pathway Management Network to provide support and opportunities to young people across the country.\nI want to encourage every young South African to join the more than 1,2 million people who are already in the network, and take their next steps to a better future.\nOf the many hardships our people had to experience last year, schooling disruption placed a huge burden on learners, teachers and families.\nDespite this, they persevered.\nIt is our priority for this year to regain lost time and improve educational outcomes, from the early years through to high school and post-school education and training.\nThe fourth priority intervention of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan is to rapidly expand energy generation capacity.\nRestoring Eskom to operational and financial health and accelerating its restructuring process is central to this objective.\nEskom has been restructured into three separate entities for generation, transmission and distribution.\nThis will lay the foundations for an efficient, modern and competitive energy system.\nEskom is making substantial progress with its intensive maintenance and operational excellence programmes to improve the reliability of its coal fleet.\nWe are working closely with Eskom on proposals to improve its financial position, manage its debt and reduce its dependence on the fiscus.\nThis requires a review of the tariff path to ensure that it reflects all reasonable costs and measures to resolve the problem of municipal debt.\nIn December 2020, government and its social partners signed the historic Eskom Social Compact, which outlines the necessary actions we must take, collectively and as individual constituencies, to meet the country’s energy needs now and into the future.\nOver the last year, we have taken action to urgently and substantially increase generation capacity in addition to what Eskom generates:\n- The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy will soon be announcing the successful bids for 2 000 megawatts (MW) of emergency power.\n- The necessary regulations have been amended and the requirements clarified for municipalities to buy power from independent power producers. Systems are being put in place to support qualifying municipalities.\n- Government will soon be initiating the procurement of an additional 11 800 MW of power from renewable energy, natural gas, battery storage and coal in line with the Integrated Resource Plan 2019.\nDespite this work, Eskom estimates that, without additional capacity, there will be an electricity supply shortfall of between 4 000 and 6 000 MW over the next five years, as old coal-fired power stations reach their end of life.\nAs part of the measures to address this shortfall, we will in the coming weeks issue a request for proposals for 2 600 MW from wind and solar energy as part of Bid Window 5.\nThis will be followed by another bid window in August 2021.\nRecent analysis suggests that easing the licensing requirements for new embedded generation projects could unlock up to 5 000 MW of additional capacity and help to ease the impact of load shedding.\nWe will therefore amend Schedule 2 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 2006 (Act 4 of 2006) within the next three months to increase the licensing threshold for embedded generation.\nThis will include consultation among key stakeholders on the level at which the new threshold should be set and the finalisation of the necessary enabling frameworks.\nEskom has already started work to expedite its commercial and technical processes to allow this additional capacity onto the grid without undue delay.\nAs we mobilise all of the resources at our disposal to support economic recovery, we cannot lose sight of the threat that climate change poses to our environmental health, socioeconomic development and economic growth.\nWe are, therefore, working to fulfil our commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement which include the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\nEskom, our largest greenhouse gas emitter, has committed in principle to net zero emission by 2050 and to increase its renewable capacity.\nEskom will be looking to partner with investors to repurpose and repower part of its coal fleet.\nThis will be done in a way that stimulates investment, local economic activity and local manufacturing, as part of a just transition.\nOur work on climate change will be guided by the Presidential Coordinating Commission on Climate Change, which is meeting for the first time this month.\nThe commission will work on a plan for a just transition to a low-carbon economy and climate resilient society.\nWe will not achieve higher rates of growth and employment if we do not implement structural economic reforms.\nThese reforms are necessary to reduce costs and barriers to entry, increase competition, stimulate new investment and create space for new entrants in the market.\nThis work is being driven through Operation Vulindlela, which involves a team in the National Treasury and the President’s office.\nOperation Vulindlela is focusing on reforms in the electricity, water, telecommunications and transport sectors, as well as reforms to our visa and immigration regime.\nThe completion of digital migration is vital to our ability to effectively harness the enormous opportunities presented by technological change.\nAfter many delays, we will begin the phased switch-off of our analogue television transmitters from next month.\nIt is anticipated that this process, which will be done province-by-province, will be completed by the end of March 2022.\nThe process for the licensing of high-demand spectrum is at an advanced stage.\nWe hope that the ongoing litigation on the licensing matter will provide legal certainty and will not unduly delay the spectrum auction process.\nIn the water sector, we are working through Operation Vulindlela to ensure that water license applications are finalised within the revised timeframe of 90 days; and to revive the Green Drop and Blue Drop programmes to strengthen water quality monitoring.\nWe will finalise and implement the revised Raw Water Pricing Strategy, and accelerate the establishment of a national water resources infrastructure agency.\nOur ability to compete in global markets depends on the efficiency of our ports and rail network.\nWe are repositioning Durban as a hub port for the Southern Hemisphere and developing Ngqura as the container terminal of choice.\nThe rail corridor from Gauteng is being extended to enable the export of vehicles through Port Elizabeth.\nThese are crucial steps to move freight from road to rail and increase the competitiveness of the rail system.\nWork is underway with the relevant departments to reform our visa and immigration regime to attract skills and grow the tourism sector.\nAs international travel starts to recover in the wake of COVID-19, we will undertake a full rollout of eVisas to visitors from China, India, Nigeria, Kenya and 10 other countries.\nThe revised list of critical skills will be published for public comment by the Department of Home Affairs, within one week, to ensure that the final version reflects the skills needed by the economy.\nThe momentum that Operation Vulindlela has already built, and the support that it has received across government, shows that we are serious about reform.\nWe will continue to work relentlessly and without pause to create a more modern, efficient and competitive economy that is more open to all South Africans.\nTo support our reform process, the Presidential State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Council has outlined a clear set of reforms that will enable these vital public companies to fulfil their mandate for growth and development.\nOverarching legislation for state-owned companies will be tabled in Cabinet this financial year and in Parliament in the next the financial year.\nA centralised SOE model is being implemented this financial year, which will ensure a standardised governance, financial management and operational performance framework for all SOEs.\nThe mandates of all SOEs are being re-evaluated to ensure that they are responsive to the country’s needs and the implementation of the National Development Plan.\nIn the midst of the economic damage caused by COVID-19, South Africa’s agricultural sector has performed remarkably well.\nIn 2020, we became the world’s second-largest exporter of citrus, with strong export growth in wine, maize, nuts, deciduous fruit and sugar cane.\nThe favourable weather conditions in 2020 and the beginning of 2021 mean that agriculture is likely to grow in the near term.\nThis provides an opportunity for further public-private partnership in agriculture to promote transformation and ensure sustainable growth.\nIt is an opportunity to accelerate land redistribution through a variety of instruments such as land restitution and expropriation of land in order to boost agricultural output.\nTo date, government has redistributed over five million hectares (ha) of land, totalling around 5 500 farms, to more than 300 000 beneficiaries.\nThis is in addition to the land restitution process, which has benefited over two million land claimants and resulted in the transfer of around 2,7 million ha.\nWe are also pursuing programmes to assist smallholder and emerging farmers with market access, to develop skills across the entire agricultural value chain and increase the number of commercial black farmers.\nDuring the course of the next financial year, we will establish a land and agrarian reform agency to fast-track land reform.\nThe Public Service is at the coalface of government, and lack of professionalism does not just impact service delivery; it also dents public confidence.\nAdvancing honesty, ethics and integrity in the Public Service is critical if we are to build a capable state.\nThrough the National School of Government, we continue to roll out courses and training programmes for government officials from entry level to senior management and the Executive.\nIn October last year, I signed off on ministerial performance agreements with all Ministers, which have now been published online.\nThis will enhance accountability and focused performance by members of the Executive.\nWe remain on course to build a capable and professional civil service that delivers on its mandate and is accountable to the South African people.\nWe are proceeding with our efforts to strengthen the local government infrastructure and accelerate service delivery through the District Development Model.\nThe model brings all three spheres of government to focus on key priorities and implementation of critical high impact projects.\nWorking with both public and private sector partners, government is implementing a range of measures to support municipalities to address inadequate and inconsistent service delivery in areas such water provision, infrastructure build and maintenance.\nWe are focusing on the appointment of properly qualified officials at a local level to ensure effective management and provision of services.\nAs we prepare for local government elections, which are due take place this year, we will need to adjust to the conditions forced upon us by COVID-19 to ensure that the people of this country can determine who represents them at this crucial level of government.\nFellow South Africans,\nCorruption is one of the greatest impediments to the country’s growth and development.\nThe revelations from the Zondo Commission of Inquiry lay bare the extent of state capture and related corruption.\nTestimony at the commission has shown how the criminal justice system was compromised and weakened.\nIt is, therefore, vital that we sustain the momentum of the rebuilding effort that we began three years ago.\nThere has been great progress in turning around law enforcement bodies.\nCritical leadership positions have been filled with capable, experienced and trustworthy professionals.\nThere is improved cooperation and sharing of resources between the respective law enforcement agencies, enabling a more integrated approach to investigations and prosecutions.\nWe have started implementation of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy, which lays the basis for a comprehensive and integrated society-wide response to corruption.\nWe will shortly be appointing members of the National Anti-Corruption Advisory Council, which is a multi-sectoral body that will oversee the initial implementation of the strategy and the establishment of an independent statutory anti-corruption body that reports to Parliament.\nWhen reports started to surface last year about possible fraud and corruption in the procurement of COVID-19-related goods and services, we acted decisively to put a stop to these practices, to investigate all allegations and to act against those responsible.\nWe established a fusion centre, which brings together key law enforcement agencies to share information and resources.\nThe fusion centre has brought many cases to trial and preserved or recovered millions of rands in public funds.\nThe Special Investigating Unit (SIU) was authorised to investigate allegations of unlawful conduct with respect to COVID-19 procurement by all state bodies during the National State of Disaster.\nAs it reported last week, the SIU has finalised investigations into 164 contracts with a total value of R3,5 billion.\nIn a significant advance for transparency and accountability, the Political Party Funding Act, 2018 (Act 6 of 2018) will come into operation on 1 April this year.\nThis will regulate public and private funding of political parties. Among other things, it requires the disclosure of donations to parties and establishes two funds that will enable represented political parties to undertake their programmes.\nCrime and violence continue to undermine people’s sense of safety and security.\nTackling crime is central to the success of our recovery.\nCrimes like cable theft, railway infrastructure vandalism, land invasions, construction site disruptions and attacks on truck drivers hamper economic activity and discourage investment.\nWe have taken steps and will continue to stop these crimes and deal with those responsible in terms of the law.\nTask teams have been set up in a number of provinces to deal with extortion and violence on sites of economic activity.\nWe are also fast-tracking the implementation and capacitation of the Border Management Agency to curb illegal immigration and cross-border crime.\nEnding gender-based violence (GBV) is imperative if we lay claim to being a society rooted in equality and non-sexism.\nWhen I launched the National Strategic Plan on Gender-Based Violence and Femicide (GBVF) in April last year, I made a promise to the women and children of this country that we were going to strengthen the Criminal Justice System to prevent them being traumatised again, and to ensure that perpetrators face justice.\nTo give effect to this, three key pieces of legislation were introduced in Parliament last year to make the criminal justice system more effective in combatting GBV.\nTo ensure that perpetrators are brought to book, we are making progress in reducing the backlog of GBV cases.\nWe continue to provide care and support to survivors of GBV.\nIn the SoNA last year, I said that we would prioritise the economic empowerment of women.\nLast year, Cabinet approved a policy that 40% of public procurement should go to women-owned businesses and entities.\nSeveral departments have started implementing this policy and are making progress.\nLast week, we also launched a groundbreaking private sector-led GBVF Response Fund.\nSeveral South African companies and global philanthropies made pledges to the value of R128 million.\nOver the next three years, government will allocate approximately R12 billion to implement the various components of the National Strategic Plan.\nGBV will only end when everyone takes responsibility for doing so in their homes, in their communities, in their workplaces, in their places of worship and in their schools.\nEqually, we need to give attention to issues affecting children, including improving school-readiness, ECD planning and funding, protection against preventable diseases, policy reform around child welfare and reducing violence against children.\nIn the year ahead, we are also going to forge ahead with efforts to provide greater opportunities for persons with disabilities to participate in the economy and in society in general.\nAs we rebuild our economy in the midst of a pandemic, it is necessary that we continue – within our means – to provide support to those businesses and individuals that continue to be most affected.\nBusinesses in several sectors are still struggling and many families continue to suffer as the job market slowly recovers.\nOver the last few months, we have had ongoing discussions with our social partners in business, labour and community-based organisations, who proposed an extension of some of the social and economic support.\nWe have, therefore, decided to extend the period for the Special COVID-19 Grant of R350 by a further three months.\nThis has proven to be an effective and efficient short-term measure to reduce the immediate impact on the livelihoods of poor South Africans.\nWe have also decided to extend the COVID-19 TERS benefit until 15 March 2021, only for those sectors that have not been able to open and operate.\nThe conditions of this extension and the sectors to be included will be announced after consultations with social partners at the National Economic Development and Labour Council.\nThe National Treasury will work with its partners and stakeholders on improvements to the Loan Guarantee Scheme so that it better addresses the realities of SMMEs and other businesses as they strive to recover.\nWe will work with our social partners to ensure that these and other interventions provide the relief to those who most need it.\nFellow South Africans,\nJust as a harsh fire gives new life to our country’s fynbos, this crisis is an opportunity to build a different, better South Africa.\nRebuilding our country requires a common effort.\nIt requires that all South African take responsibility and play their part.\nLet us work together as government, as business, as labour, as political parties and as all of society to clear away the rubble and lay a new foundation.\nAbove all, let us return this country to the values upon which it was founded.\nOn the day of his release, 31 years ago, Madiba gave his first public address here in Cape Town, where he reminded South Africans that there were difficult days ahead, and that the battle was far from won.\nMadiba said:\n“Now is the time to intensify the Struggle on all fronts.”\n“To relax our efforts now would be a mistake which generations to come will not be able to forgive.”\nIn counting the great cost to our society over the past year, we may be tempted to lose faith.\nBut we can get through this. Because we are a nation of heroes.\nI am referring not to the glorious lineage of Struggle icons, but to the everyday heroes that walk among us, who work hard every day to put food on the table, to keep the company running, and to give support, help and care to our people.\nIt is your resilience that will help this country recover.\nIn addition to the many challenges that beset our people, we have heard that his Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini has not been well in recent days and is admitted to hospital.\nI wish to convey my wishes for the speedy recovery of His Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini ka Bhekuzulu.\nOur thoughts and prayers are with the Royal Household and the Zulu nation at this time.\nIt is our collective wish that Isilo Samabandla Wonke is soon restored to good health.\nAs we prepare for the difficult path ahead, we can draw strength From Maya Angelou’s great poem, Still I rise.\nShe writes:\nOut of the huts of history’s shame\nI rise\nUp from a past that’s rooted in pain\nI rise\nI’m a black ocean, leaping and wide,\nWelling and swelling I bear in the tide.\nLeaving behind nights of terror and fear\nI rise\nInto a daybreak that’s wondrously clear\nI rise\nBringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,\nI am the dream and the hope of the slave.\nI rise I rise I rise.\nPeople of South Africa, it is your country that calls on you to rise.\nLet us march forward together to equality, to growth, to dignity and to recovery.\nMay God bless South Africa and protect her sons and daughters.\nI thank you."}, {"claim": "In 2020, South Africa became the world’s second-largest exporter of citrus.", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Not Enough Evidence", "justification": "According to the source linked in the q&a, there were no figures sourced for 2020.

It is wondrous in its diversity.\nOur national flower, the Protea, is a species of fynbos.\nWhen I opened the third National Investment Conference last year, I spoke of the Protea's unique properties that in so many ways resemble our national character.\nWhat is most unique and special about fynbos is that to be sustainable and survive, it needs fire.\nAt least once every twenty years, fynbos must burn at extremely high temperatures to allow the ecosystem to be rejuvenated and grow afresh.\nThroughout the summer, the burned foliage lies desolate. But when the autumn rains return, the seeds germinate, and its life cycle begins all over again.\nThe mountains bloom with new life as plants which once seemed lost grow back even stronger than before.\nWe, the people of South Africa, have over the past year experienced a terrible hardship.\nLike a wildfire that sweeps across the mountainous ranges where the fynbos grows, a deadly pandemic has swept across the world, leaving devastation in its path.\nAnd yet, like the hardy fynbos of our native land, we too have proven to be resilient in many ways.\nFor three centuries, we were victims of oppression, dispossession and injustice.\nAnd for three centuries, we resisted.\nThe flames of injustice may have scarred us, but they did not consume us.\nThe rains of democracy brought rejuvenation and the birth of a new nation.\nWe have risen time and time again from the depths of darkness to herald a new day.\nAs we look on the grave damage that this disease has caused, we know that like the fynbos, like all those who have walked this land before us, we will rise again.\nNearly a year has passed since South Africa saw its first case of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19.\nSince then, nearly one-and-a-half million people in our country are known to have been infected by the virus.\nMore than 45 000 people are known to have died.\nBeyond these statistics lies a human story of tragedy and pain.\nThere is no family, no community and no place of work that has not lost someone they knew, worked with and loved.\nIt is also a story of courage and resilience.\nThe resilience of the hospital worker who – day after day, night after night – goes to work to save lives, knowing that they, themselves, are at risk of infection.\nIt is a wonderful account of the courage of the police officer, the soldier, the essential worker, the carer and all those on the frontline, who have kept our country safe, our people fed and our economy going.\nIt is a story of solidarity and compassion.\nOf a nation that has stood together to confront COVID-19 in ways not seen since the early days of our democracy.\nMore than anything else, this crisis has revealed the true character of our remarkable nation.\nIt has revealed a spirit of the people who refused to be defeated.\nIt is this South African spirit that must drive our resolve to build a new and more equal economy and a better, more just society.\nThe year ahead must be a time for change, for progress and for rebirth.\nIt must be a year in which we rise.\nThis is no ordinary year, and this is no ordinary SoNA.\nI will therefore, focus this evening on the foremost, overriding priorities of 2021.\nFirst, we must defeat the coronavirus pandemic.\nSecond, we must accelerate our economic recovery.\nThird, we must implement economic reforms to create sustainable jobs and drive inclusive growth.\nAnd finally, we must fight corruption and strengthen the State.\nIn the coming weeks, we will address the other important elements of government’s programme for the year.\nFundamental to our nation’s recovery is an unrelenting and comprehensive response to overcome the coronavirus.\nSouth Africa has just emerged from the second wave of infections since COVID-19 arrived on our shores in March last year.\nDriven by a new variant of the virus, this second wave was more severe and cost many more lives than the first wave.\nNevertheless, the human cost could have been far greater.\nHad we not moved quickly to restrict movement and activity, had we not prepared our health facilities, had South Africans not observed the basic health protocols, the devastation caused by this virus could have been far worse.\nThis year, we must do everything in our means to contain and overcome this pandemic.\nThis means intensifying our prevention efforts and strengthening our health system.\nIt also means that we must undertake a massive vaccination programme to save lives and dramatically reduce infections across the population.\nEarlier this week, we were informed that one of the vaccines that we had procured, the AstraZeneca vaccine, offers minimal protection from mild to moderate infection by the new variant known as 501Y.v2.\nThis is according to early findings of a study by our scientists and researchers.\nWe applaud these scientists for leading this research and providing new evidence that is vital for guiding our response.\nSince this variant is now the dominant variant in our country, these findings have significant implications for the pace, design and sequencing of our vaccine programme.\nWhile it should not delay the start of the vaccination programme by much, it will affect the choice of vaccines and the manner of their deployment.\nThe first phase of our vaccination programme, which is targeted at health and other frontline workers, will now use the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which has been shown to be effective against the 501Y.V2 variant.\nWe have secured nine million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\nThe first batch, of 80 000 doses, will arrive in the country next week.\nFurther consignments will arrive over the next four weeks, totalling 500 000 Johnson & Johnson vaccines.\nAll provinces have rollout plans in place as the first vaccines come through.\nI wish to thank all provinces for their level of preparedness for this massive undertaking that we are about to embark upon.\nIn addition, we have secured 12 million vaccine doses from the global COVAX facility.\nThis will be complemented by other vaccines that are available to South Africa through the African Union’s (AU) African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team Facility.\nPfizer has committed 20 million vaccine doses, commencing with deliveries at the end of the first quarter.\nWe are continuing our engagements with all the vaccine manufacturers to ensure that we secure sufficient quantities of vaccines that are suitable to our conditions.\nThe health and safety of our people remains our paramount concern.\nAll medication imported into the country is monitored, evaluated, investigated, inspected and registered by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority.\nWe will continue to use the science-driven approach that has served us well since the earliest days of the pandemic.\nThe success of the vaccination programme will rely on active collaboration between all sectors of society.\nWe are greatly encouraged by the active involvement of business, labour, the health industry and medical schemes, in particular, in preparing for this mass vaccination drive.\nAs we have overcome before, we will overcome again and rise.\nBut it is not just this disease that we must defeat.\nWe must overcome poverty, hunger, joblessness and inequality.\nWe must overcome a legacy of exclusion and dispossession that continues to impoverish our people, and which this pandemic has severely worsened.\nWhen I delivered the SoNA in this House last year, none of us could have imagined how – within a matter of weeks – our country and our world would have changed so dramatically.\nOur plans had to be adapted in response to a global emergency.\nBudgets had to be reprioritised and many programmes had to be deferred.\nOver the past year, South Africa has experienced a sharp decline in growth and a significant increase in unemployment.\nPoverty is on the rise. Inequality is deepening.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, our economy was 6% smaller than it was in the last quarter of 2019.\nThere were 1,7 million fewer people employed in the third quarter of 2020 than there were in the first quarter, before the pandemic struck.\nOur unemployment rate now stands at a staggering 30,8%.\nAs a result of the relief measures that we implemented and the phased reopening of the economy, we expect to see a strong recovery in employment by the end of the year.\nAs we worked to contain the spread of the virus, we also had to take extraordinary measures to support ordinary South Africans, assist businesses in distress and protect people’s livelihoods.\nThe Social and Economic Relief Package that we introduced in April last year is the largest intervention of its kind in our history.\nIt identified measures worth a total of R500 billion – or about 10% of our gross domestic product – to provide cash directly to the poorest households, to provide wage support to workers and to provide various forms of relief to struggling businesses.\nA total of 18 million people, or close to one-third of the population, received additional grant payments through these relief measures.\nIt is estimated that this grant lifted more than five million people above the food poverty line, helping to alleviate hunger in a moment of great crisis.\nTo date, more than R57 billion in wage support has been paid to over 4,5 million workers through the special Unemployment Insurance Fund Temporary Employer-Employee Relief Scheme (TERS).\nMore than R1,3 billion has been provided in support mainly for small- and medium-sized businesses.\nIn addition, over R70 billion in tax relief was extended to businesses in distress.\nAround R18,9 billion in loans have been approved for 13 000 businesses through the Loan Guarantee Scheme.\nFellow South Africans,\nIt is nearly four months since I stood here before a joint sitting of this Parliament to present to the nation the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan.\nThis evening, we stand here not to make promises but to report on progress in the implementation of the recovery plan and the priority actions we must take to restore growth and create jobs.\nSince the launch of the plan, we have focused on four priority interventions:\n- a massive rollout of infrastructure throughout the country,\n- a massive increase in local production,\n- an employment stimulus to create jobs and support livelihoods, and\n- the rapid expansion of our energy generation capacity.\nWe announced that we would be embarking on a massive rollout of infrastructure throughout the country.\nWe knew that to achieve this objective we would need to steadily rebuild technical skills within government to prepare and manage large infrastructure projects.\nWe have now developed an infrastructure investment project pipeline worth R340 billion in network industries such as energy, water, transport and telecommunications.\nConstruction has started and progress is being made on a number of these projects.\nSince the announcement of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, we have launched two major human settlements projects that will provide homes to almost 68 000 households in the Gauteng province.\nSimilar human settlements projects are planned in other provinces.\nTwo years ago, I spoke about the dream of building new cities that will enable us to make a break with apartheid’s spatial development.\nNew post-apartheid cities are being conceptualised in a number of places in our country.\nThe Lanseria Smart City, the first new city to be built in a democratic South Africa, is now a reality in the making.\nThe draft masterplan for this smart city – which will become home to between 350 000 to 500 000 people within the next decade – was completed in November 2020 and is now out for public comment.\nProgress is being made on several major water infrastructure projects.\nThese include Phase 2A of the Mokolo and Crocodile River Project, and the uMkhomazi Water Project.\nThe Infrastructure Investment Plan identifies roads projects worth R19 billion covering the spine of the South African road network.\nWork is underway to finalise finance structuring for these projects.\nResources have been committed from the fiscus to support the construction and rehabilitation of the major N1, N2 and N3 highways.\nThese infrastructure projects will lead to the revival of the construction industry and the creation of much-needed jobs.\nThe R100 billion Infrastructure Fund is now in full operation.\nThis fund will blend resources from the fiscus with financing from the private sector and development institutions.\nIts approved project pipeline for 2021 is varied and includes the Student Housing Infrastructure Programme, which aims to provide 300 000 student beds.\nAnother approved project is SA Connect, a programme to roll out broadband to schools, hospitals, police stations and other government facilities.\nThe second priority intervention of the recovery plan is to support a massive increase in local production and to make South African exports globally competitive.\nThis will encourage greater investment by the private sector in productive activity.\nKey to this plan is a renewed commitment from government, business and organised labour to buy local.\nThis commitment should lead to increased local production, which will lead to the revival of our manufacturing industry.\nAll social partners that participated in the development of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, as part of our social compact, have agreed to work together to reduce our reliance on imports by 20% over the next five years.\nThey have identified 42 products – ranging from edible oils to furniture, fruit concentrates, personal protective equipment, steel products and green economy inputs – that can be sourced locally.\nIf we achieve our target, we will significantly expand our productive economy, potentially returning more than R200 billion to the country’s annual output.\nLast year, we undertook to create a larger market for small businesses and designate 1 000 locally produced products that must be procured from Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs).\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic forced the closure of global value chains, we have been able to speed up this initiative as the local supply chains became open for locally manufactured products.\nTo this end, Cabinet approved the SMME-Focused Localisation Policy Framework which identified the 1 000 products.\nFurthermore, the departments of Small Business Development and Trade, Industry and Competition are supporting SMMEs to access larger domestic and international markets.\nThese efforts are supported by robust manufacturing support programmes.\nIn the SoNA last year, I said that our vision for industrialisation is underpinned by sector master plans to rejuvenate and grow key industries.\nFour master plans that have been completed and signed to date – which are part of the social compact between labour, business, government and communities – have already had an impact in their respective industries.\nThrough the implementation of the Poultry Master Plan, the industry has invested R800 million to upgrade production.\nSouth Africa now produces an additional one million chickens every week.\nThe Sugar Master Plan was signed during the lockdown, with a commitment from large users of sugar to procure at least 80% of their sugar needs from local growers.\nThrough the implementation of the plan, last year saw a rise in local production and a decline in imported sugar, creating stability for an industry which employs some 85 000 workers.\nSupport for black small-scale farmers is being stepped up, with a large beverage producer committing to expand their procurement sharply.\nSince the signing of the Clothing, Textile, Footwear and Leather Masterplan in November 2019, the industry has invested more than half a billion rand to expand local manufacturing facilities, including SMMEs.\nWe have worked closely with the auto sector to help it weather the pandemic.\nBy the end of the year, the sector had recovered around 70% of its normal annual production, in difficult circumstances.\nLast week, the Ford Motor Company announced a R16 billion investment to expand their manufacturing facility in Tshwane for the next generation Ford Ranger bakkie.\nThis investment will support the growth of around 12 small and medium enterprises in automotive component manufacturing.\nNearly half of the procurement spend on construction of the bulk earthworks and top structure at the Tshwane Special Economic Zone during this phase is expected to be allocated for SMMEs, an amount equal to R1,7 billion in procurement opportunities.\nToyota has invested in its KwaZulu-Natal facility to start production of the first generation of hybrid electric vehicles to come off a South African assembly line.\nThis follows investment announcements by Nissan, Mercedes Benz and Isuzu in expanded production facilities, all of which cement South Africa’s position as a global player in auto manufacturing.\nThis year, our focus will be on getting the industry back to full production, implementing the Black Industrialist Fund and working on a new platform for expanded auto trade with the rest of the continent.\nThis will be part of our concerted effort to boost the manufacturing sector.\nThis year, we will begin to harness the opportunities presented by the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which came into operation on 1 January, following the adoption of the Johannesburg Declaration by the AU.\nThe AfCFTA provides a platform for South African businesses to expand into markets across the continent, and for South Africa to position itself as a gateway to the continent.\nTo address the deep inequalities in our society, we must accelerate the implementation of broad-based black economic empowerment policies on ownership, control and management of the economy.\nLast year, government agreed to landmark deals with companies that will advance black economic empowerment by transferring ownership to their workers.\nIn November last year, we held our third South Africa Investment Conference to review the implementation of previous commitments and to generate new investment into our economy.\nEven under difficult economic circumstances, the investment conference managed to raise some R108 billion in additional investment commitments.\nTogether with investment confirmed from the two previous conferences, we have now received R773 billion in investment commitments towards our five-year target of R1,2 trillion.\nFirms have reported that some R183 billion of these investments has already flowed into projects that benefit the South African economy.\nThis shows that our country is still an attractive investment destination for both local and offshore companies.\nWe have worked to facilitate investment by increasing the ease of doing business, including making it easier to start a business.\nIn the past year, more than 125 000 new companies were registered through the BizPortal platform, completing their registration in just a matter of hours from the comfort of their homes or offices.\nWe are making it easier for business to do business.\nOur third priority intervention is an employment stimulus to create jobs and support livelihoods.\nThe largest numbers of jobs will be created by the private sector in a number of industries as the economy recovers.\nWe continue to work in a social compact with the private sector to create a more conducive environment for them to be able to create jobs.\nOur compact with the private sector is underpinned by a clear commitment to grow our economy and to create jobs.\nHowever, the public sector has a responsibility to stimulate job creation; both through its policies and through direct job creation opportunities.\nThe Presidential Employment Stimulus is one of the most significant expansions of public and social employment in South Africa’s history.\nBy the end of January 2021, over 430 000 opportunities were already supported through the stimulus.\nA further 180 000 opportunities are currently in the recruitment process.\nThese opportunities are in areas like education, arts and culture, global business services, early childhood development (ECD), and small-scale and subsistence farming.\nIt involves environmental programmes such as the clearing of alien trees, wetland rehabilitation, fire prevention, and cleaning and greening across all municipalities.\nThese programmes are about real lives and real livelihoods.\nNearly half a million people are now receiving an income, developing new skills and contributing to their community and the country’s economy.\nWe will continue to support employment for as long as it is necessary while the labour market recovers, even as we work to promote stronger and more resilient growth in the private sector.\nIn the SoNA last year, in response to the huge challenge our country faces of youth unemployment, I announced that the National Youth Development Agency and the Department of Small Business Development would provide grant funding and business support to 1 000 young entrepreneurs within 100 days.\nWhile the programme had to be put on hold due to the coronavirus restrictions, it nevertheless managed to reach its target of 1 000 businesses by International Youth Day on 12 August 2020.\nThis provides a firm foundation for our efforts to support 15 000 start-ups by 2024.\nLast year, we said we would establish the National Pathway Management Network to provide support and opportunities to young people across the country.\nI want to encourage every young South African to join the more than 1,2 million people who are already in the network, and take their next steps to a better future.\nOf the many hardships our people had to experience last year, schooling disruption placed a huge burden on learners, teachers and families.\nDespite this, they persevered.\nIt is our priority for this year to regain lost time and improve educational outcomes, from the early years through to high school and post-school education and training.\nThe fourth priority intervention of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan is to rapidly expand energy generation capacity.\nRestoring Eskom to operational and financial health and accelerating its restructuring process is central to this objective.\nEskom has been restructured into three separate entities for generation, transmission and distribution.\nThis will lay the foundations for an efficient, modern and competitive energy system.\nEskom is making substantial progress with its intensive maintenance and operational excellence programmes to improve the reliability of its coal fleet.\nWe are working closely with Eskom on proposals to improve its financial position, manage its debt and reduce its dependence on the fiscus.\nThis requires a review of the tariff path to ensure that it reflects all reasonable costs and measures to resolve the problem of municipal debt.\nIn December 2020, government and its social partners signed the historic Eskom Social Compact, which outlines the necessary actions we must take, collectively and as individual constituencies, to meet the country’s energy needs now and into the future.\nOver the last year, we have taken action to urgently and substantially increase generation capacity in addition to what Eskom generates:\n- The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy will soon be announcing the successful bids for 2 000 megawatts (MW) of emergency power.\n- The necessary regulations have been amended and the requirements clarified for municipalities to buy power from independent power producers. Systems are being put in place to support qualifying municipalities.\n- Government will soon be initiating the procurement of an additional 11 800 MW of power from renewable energy, natural gas, battery storage and coal in line with the Integrated Resource Plan 2019.\nDespite this work, Eskom estimates that, without additional capacity, there will be an electricity supply shortfall of between 4 000 and 6 000 MW over the next five years, as old coal-fired power stations reach their end of life.\nAs part of the measures to address this shortfall, we will in the coming weeks issue a request for proposals for 2 600 MW from wind and solar energy as part of Bid Window 5.\nThis will be followed by another bid window in August 2021.\nRecent analysis suggests that easing the licensing requirements for new embedded generation projects could unlock up to 5 000 MW of additional capacity and help to ease the impact of load shedding.\nWe will therefore amend Schedule 2 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 2006 (Act 4 of 2006) within the next three months to increase the licensing threshold for embedded generation.\nThis will include consultation among key stakeholders on the level at which the new threshold should be set and the finalisation of the necessary enabling frameworks.\nEskom has already started work to expedite its commercial and technical processes to allow this additional capacity onto the grid without undue delay.\nAs we mobilise all of the resources at our disposal to support economic recovery, we cannot lose sight of the threat that climate change poses to our environmental health, socioeconomic development and economic growth.\nWe are, therefore, working to fulfil our commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement which include the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\nEskom, our largest greenhouse gas emitter, has committed in principle to net zero emission by 2050 and to increase its renewable capacity.\nEskom will be looking to partner with investors to repurpose and repower part of its coal fleet.\nThis will be done in a way that stimulates investment, local economic activity and local manufacturing, as part of a just transition.\nOur work on climate change will be guided by the Presidential Coordinating Commission on Climate Change, which is meeting for the first time this month.\nThe commission will work on a plan for a just transition to a low-carbon economy and climate resilient society.\nWe will not achieve higher rates of growth and employment if we do not implement structural economic reforms.\nThese reforms are necessary to reduce costs and barriers to entry, increase competition, stimulate new investment and create space for new entrants in the market.\nThis work is being driven through Operation Vulindlela, which involves a team in the National Treasury and the President’s office.\nOperation Vulindlela is focusing on reforms in the electricity, water, telecommunications and transport sectors, as well as reforms to our visa and immigration regime.\nThe completion of digital migration is vital to our ability to effectively harness the enormous opportunities presented by technological change.\nAfter many delays, we will begin the phased switch-off of our analogue television transmitters from next month.\nIt is anticipated that this process, which will be done province-by-province, will be completed by the end of March 2022.\nThe process for the licensing of high-demand spectrum is at an advanced stage.\nWe hope that the ongoing litigation on the licensing matter will provide legal certainty and will not unduly delay the spectrum auction process.\nIn the water sector, we are working through Operation Vulindlela to ensure that water license applications are finalised within the revised timeframe of 90 days; and to revive the Green Drop and Blue Drop programmes to strengthen water quality monitoring.\nWe will finalise and implement the revised Raw Water Pricing Strategy, and accelerate the establishment of a national water resources infrastructure agency.\nOur ability to compete in global markets depends on the efficiency of our ports and rail network.\nWe are repositioning Durban as a hub port for the Southern Hemisphere and developing Ngqura as the container terminal of choice.\nThe rail corridor from Gauteng is being extended to enable the export of vehicles through Port Elizabeth.\nThese are crucial steps to move freight from road to rail and increase the competitiveness of the rail system.\nWork is underway with the relevant departments to reform our visa and immigration regime to attract skills and grow the tourism sector.\nAs international travel starts to recover in the wake of COVID-19, we will undertake a full rollout of eVisas to visitors from China, India, Nigeria, Kenya and 10 other countries.\nThe revised list of critical skills will be published for public comment by the Department of Home Affairs, within one week, to ensure that the final version reflects the skills needed by the economy.\nThe momentum that Operation Vulindlela has already built, and the support that it has received across government, shows that we are serious about reform.\nWe will continue to work relentlessly and without pause to create a more modern, efficient and competitive economy that is more open to all South Africans.\nTo support our reform process, the Presidential State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Council has outlined a clear set of reforms that will enable these vital public companies to fulfil their mandate for growth and development.\nOverarching legislation for state-owned companies will be tabled in Cabinet this financial year and in Parliament in the next the financial year.\nA centralised SOE model is being implemented this financial year, which will ensure a standardised governance, financial management and operational performance framework for all SOEs.\nThe mandates of all SOEs are being re-evaluated to ensure that they are responsive to the country’s needs and the implementation of the National Development Plan.\nIn the midst of the economic damage caused by COVID-19, South Africa’s agricultural sector has performed remarkably well.\nIn 2020, we became the world’s second-largest exporter of citrus, with strong export growth in wine, maize, nuts, deciduous fruit and sugar cane.\nThe favourable weather conditions in 2020 and the beginning of 2021 mean that agriculture is likely to grow in the near term.\nThis provides an opportunity for further public-private partnership in agriculture to promote transformation and ensure sustainable growth.\nIt is an opportunity to accelerate land redistribution through a variety of instruments such as land restitution and expropriation of land in order to boost agricultural output.\nTo date, government has redistributed over five million hectares (ha) of land, totalling around 5 500 farms, to more than 300 000 beneficiaries.\nThis is in addition to the land restitution process, which has benefited over two million land claimants and resulted in the transfer of around 2,7 million ha.\nWe are also pursuing programmes to assist smallholder and emerging farmers with market access, to develop skills across the entire agricultural value chain and increase the number of commercial black farmers.\nDuring the course of the next financial year, we will establish a land and agrarian reform agency to fast-track land reform.\nThe Public Service is at the coalface of government, and lack of professionalism does not just impact service delivery; it also dents public confidence.\nAdvancing honesty, ethics and integrity in the Public Service is critical if we are to build a capable state.\nThrough the National School of Government, we continue to roll out courses and training programmes for government officials from entry level to senior management and the Executive.\nIn October last year, I signed off on ministerial performance agreements with all Ministers, which have now been published online.\nThis will enhance accountability and focused performance by members of the Executive.\nWe remain on course to build a capable and professional civil service that delivers on its mandate and is accountable to the South African people.\nWe are proceeding with our efforts to strengthen the local government infrastructure and accelerate service delivery through the District Development Model.\nThe model brings all three spheres of government to focus on key priorities and implementation of critical high impact projects.\nWorking with both public and private sector partners, government is implementing a range of measures to support municipalities to address inadequate and inconsistent service delivery in areas such water provision, infrastructure build and maintenance.\nWe are focusing on the appointment of properly qualified officials at a local level to ensure effective management and provision of services.\nAs we prepare for local government elections, which are due take place this year, we will need to adjust to the conditions forced upon us by COVID-19 to ensure that the people of this country can determine who represents them at this crucial level of government.\nFellow South Africans,\nCorruption is one of the greatest impediments to the country’s growth and development.\nThe revelations from the Zondo Commission of Inquiry lay bare the extent of state capture and related corruption.\nTestimony at the commission has shown how the criminal justice system was compromised and weakened.\nIt is, therefore, vital that we sustain the momentum of the rebuilding effort that we began three years ago.\nThere has been great progress in turning around law enforcement bodies.\nCritical leadership positions have been filled with capable, experienced and trustworthy professionals.\nThere is improved cooperation and sharing of resources between the respective law enforcement agencies, enabling a more integrated approach to investigations and prosecutions.\nWe have started implementation of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy, which lays the basis for a comprehensive and integrated society-wide response to corruption.\nWe will shortly be appointing members of the National Anti-Corruption Advisory Council, which is a multi-sectoral body that will oversee the initial implementation of the strategy and the establishment of an independent statutory anti-corruption body that reports to Parliament.\nWhen reports started to surface last year about possible fraud and corruption in the procurement of COVID-19-related goods and services, we acted decisively to put a stop to these practices, to investigate all allegations and to act against those responsible.\nWe established a fusion centre, which brings together key law enforcement agencies to share information and resources.\nThe fusion centre has brought many cases to trial and preserved or recovered millions of rands in public funds.\nThe Special Investigating Unit (SIU) was authorised to investigate allegations of unlawful conduct with respect to COVID-19 procurement by all state bodies during the National State of Disaster.\nAs it reported last week, the SIU has finalised investigations into 164 contracts with a total value of R3,5 billion.\nIn a significant advance for transparency and accountability, the Political Party Funding Act, 2018 (Act 6 of 2018) will come into operation on 1 April this year.\nThis will regulate public and private funding of political parties. Among other things, it requires the disclosure of donations to parties and establishes two funds that will enable represented political parties to undertake their programmes.\nCrime and violence continue to undermine people’s sense of safety and security.\nTackling crime is central to the success of our recovery.\nCrimes like cable theft, railway infrastructure vandalism, land invasions, construction site disruptions and attacks on truck drivers hamper economic activity and discourage investment.\nWe have taken steps and will continue to stop these crimes and deal with those responsible in terms of the law.\nTask teams have been set up in a number of provinces to deal with extortion and violence on sites of economic activity.\nWe are also fast-tracking the implementation and capacitation of the Border Management Agency to curb illegal immigration and cross-border crime.\nEnding gender-based violence (GBV) is imperative if we lay claim to being a society rooted in equality and non-sexism.\nWhen I launched the National Strategic Plan on Gender-Based Violence and Femicide (GBVF) in April last year, I made a promise to the women and children of this country that we were going to strengthen the Criminal Justice System to prevent them being traumatised again, and to ensure that perpetrators face justice.\nTo give effect to this, three key pieces of legislation were introduced in Parliament last year to make the criminal justice system more effective in combatting GBV.\nTo ensure that perpetrators are brought to book, we are making progress in reducing the backlog of GBV cases.\nWe continue to provide care and support to survivors of GBV.\nIn the SoNA last year, I said that we would prioritise the economic empowerment of women.\nLast year, Cabinet approved a policy that 40% of public procurement should go to women-owned businesses and entities.\nSeveral departments have started implementing this policy and are making progress.\nLast week, we also launched a groundbreaking private sector-led GBVF Response Fund.\nSeveral South African companies and global philanthropies made pledges to the value of R128 million.\nOver the next three years, government will allocate approximately R12 billion to implement the various components of the National Strategic Plan.\nGBV will only end when everyone takes responsibility for doing so in their homes, in their communities, in their workplaces, in their places of worship and in their schools.\nEqually, we need to give attention to issues affecting children, including improving school-readiness, ECD planning and funding, protection against preventable diseases, policy reform around child welfare and reducing violence against children.\nIn the year ahead, we are also going to forge ahead with efforts to provide greater opportunities for persons with disabilities to participate in the economy and in society in general.\nAs we rebuild our economy in the midst of a pandemic, it is necessary that we continue – within our means – to provide support to those businesses and individuals that continue to be most affected.\nBusinesses in several sectors are still struggling and many families continue to suffer as the job market slowly recovers.\nOver the last few months, we have had ongoing discussions with our social partners in business, labour and community-based organisations, who proposed an extension of some of the social and economic support.\nWe have, therefore, decided to extend the period for the Special COVID-19 Grant of R350 by a further three months.\nThis has proven to be an effective and efficient short-term measure to reduce the immediate impact on the livelihoods of poor South Africans.\nWe have also decided to extend the COVID-19 TERS benefit until 15 March 2021, only for those sectors that have not been able to open and operate.\nThe conditions of this extension and the sectors to be included will be announced after consultations with social partners at the National Economic Development and Labour Council.\nThe National Treasury will work with its partners and stakeholders on improvements to the Loan Guarantee Scheme so that it better addresses the realities of SMMEs and other businesses as they strive to recover.\nWe will work with our social partners to ensure that these and other interventions provide the relief to those who most need it.\nFellow South Africans,\nJust as a harsh fire gives new life to our country’s fynbos, this crisis is an opportunity to build a different, better South Africa.\nRebuilding our country requires a common effort.\nIt requires that all South African take responsibility and play their part.\nLet us work together as government, as business, as labour, as political parties and as all of society to clear away the rubble and lay a new foundation.\nAbove all, let us return this country to the values upon which it was founded.\nOn the day of his release, 31 years ago, Madiba gave his first public address here in Cape Town, where he reminded South Africans that there were difficult days ahead, and that the battle was far from won.\nMadiba said:\n“Now is the time to intensify the Struggle on all fronts.”\n“To relax our efforts now would be a mistake which generations to come will not be able to forgive.”\nIn counting the great cost to our society over the past year, we may be tempted to lose faith.\nBut we can get through this. Because we are a nation of heroes.\nI am referring not to the glorious lineage of Struggle icons, but to the everyday heroes that walk among us, who work hard every day to put food on the table, to keep the company running, and to give support, help and care to our people.\nIt is your resilience that will help this country recover.\nIn addition to the many challenges that beset our people, we have heard that his Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini has not been well in recent days and is admitted to hospital.\nI wish to convey my wishes for the speedy recovery of His Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini ka Bhekuzulu.\nOur thoughts and prayers are with the Royal Household and the Zulu nation at this time.\nIt is our collective wish that Isilo Samabandla Wonke is soon restored to good health.\nAs we prepare for the difficult path ahead, we can draw strength From Maya Angelou’s great poem, Still I rise.\nShe writes:\nOut of the huts of history’s shame\nI rise\nUp from a past that’s rooted in pain\nI rise\nI’m a black ocean, leaping and wide,\nWelling and swelling I bear in the tide.\nLeaving behind nights of terror and fear\nI rise\nInto a daybreak that’s wondrously clear\nI rise\nBringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,\nI am the dream and the hope of the slave.\nI rise I rise I rise.\nPeople of South Africa, it is your country that calls on you to rise.\nLet us march forward together to equality, to growth, to dignity and to recovery.\nMay God bless South Africa and protect her sons and daughters.\nI thank you."}, {"claim": "By the end of January 2021, over 430,000 opportunities were supported through the South African Presidential Employment Stimulus.", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Supported", "justification": "the answer is very similar to the claim", "claim_date": "11-2-2021", "speaker": "Cyril Ramaphosa ", "original_claim_url": "https://www.gov.za/speeches/president-cyril-ramaphosa-2021-state-nation-address-11-feb-2021-0000", "fact_checking_article": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210316155254/https://africacheck.org/fact-checks/reports/chickens-and-economy-fact-checking-ramaphosas-sona2021", "reporting_source": "speech", "location_ISO_code": "ZA", "claim_types": ["Numerical Claim"], "fact_checking_strategies": ["Written Evidence", "Numerical Comparison"], "questions": [{"question": "How many people have benefited from being supported through the South African Presidential Employment Stimulus?", "answers": [{"answer": "433,167", "answer_type": "Extractive", "source_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210316155254/http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/download/file/fid/1993", "source_medium": "PDF"}]}], "orig_claim": "Eskom is the “largest greenhouse gas emitter” in South Africa.", "orig_verdict": "Correct", "fulltext": "State of the Nation Address by President Cyril Ramaphosa, Parliament, Cape Town\nSpeaker of the National Assembly (NA), Ms Thandi Modise,\nChairperson of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP), Mr Amos Masondo,\nDeputy President David Mabuza,\nFormer President Thabo Mbeki and Mrs Mbeki,\nFormer Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka,\nFormer Deputy President Baleka Mbete,\nChief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng and esteemed members of the Judiciary,\nMinisters and Deputy Ministers,\nHonourable members of the NA,\nHonourable members of the NCOP,\nDean of the European Region, representing the diplomatic corps, His Excellency, Mr Beka Dvali,\nDistinguished guests,\nFellow South Africans,\nOn this day, 31 years ago, President Nelson Mandela walked out of the gates of Victor Verster Prison a free person, a living embodiment of the resilience and courage of the South African people.\nFor nearly 40 million years, an extraordinary ecosystem has existed here at the southernmost tip of our continent.\nThe Fynbos Biome, which stretches across the Cape, has among the most distinctive features of any plants found on earth.\nIt can adapt to dry, hot summers and cold rainy winters. It is wondrous in its diversity.\nOur national flower, the Protea, is a species of fynbos.\nWhen I opened the third National Investment Conference last year, I spoke of the Protea's unique properties that in so many ways resemble our national character.\nWhat is most unique and special about fynbos is that to be sustainable and survive, it needs fire.\nAt least once every twenty years, fynbos must burn at extremely high temperatures to allow the ecosystem to be rejuvenated and grow afresh.\nThroughout the summer, the burned foliage lies desolate. But when the autumn rains return, the seeds germinate, and its life cycle begins all over again.\nThe mountains bloom with new life as plants which once seemed lost grow back even stronger than before.\nWe, the people of South Africa, have over the past year experienced a terrible hardship.\nLike a wildfire that sweeps across the mountainous ranges where the fynbos grows, a deadly pandemic has swept across the world, leaving devastation in its path.\nAnd yet, like the hardy fynbos of our native land, we too have proven to be resilient in many ways.\nFor three centuries, we were victims of oppression, dispossession and injustice.\nAnd for three centuries, we resisted.\nThe flames of injustice may have scarred us, but they did not consume us.\nThe rains of democracy brought rejuvenation and the birth of a new nation.\nWe have risen time and time again from the depths of darkness to herald a new day.\nAs we look on the grave damage that this disease has caused, we know that like the fynbos, like all those who have walked this land before us, we will rise again.\nNearly a year has passed since South Africa saw its first case of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19.\nSince then, nearly one-and-a-half million people in our country are known to have been infected by the virus.\nMore than 45 000 people are known to have died.\nBeyond these statistics lies a human story of tragedy and pain.\nThere is no family, no community and no place of work that has not lost someone they knew, worked with and loved.\nIt is also a story of courage and resilience.\nThe resilience of the hospital worker who – day after day, night after night – goes to work to save lives, knowing that they, themselves, are at risk of infection.\nIt is a wonderful account of the courage of the police officer, the soldier, the essential worker, the carer and all those on the frontline, who have kept our country safe, our people fed and our economy going.\nIt is a story of solidarity and compassion.\nOf a nation that has stood together to confront COVID-19 in ways not seen since the early days of our democracy.\nMore than anything else, this crisis has revealed the true character of our remarkable nation.\nIt has revealed a spirit of the people who refused to be defeated.\nIt is this South African spirit that must drive our resolve to build a new and more equal economy and a better, more just society.\nThe year ahead must be a time for change, for progress and for rebirth.\nIt must be a year in which we rise.\nThis is no ordinary year, and this is no ordinary SoNA.\nI will therefore, focus this evening on the foremost, overriding priorities of 2021.\nFirst, we must defeat the coronavirus pandemic.\nSecond, we must accelerate our economic recovery.\nThird, we must implement economic reforms to create sustainable jobs and drive inclusive growth.\nAnd finally, we must fight corruption and strengthen the State.\nIn the coming weeks, we will address the other important elements of government’s programme for the year.\nFundamental to our nation’s recovery is an unrelenting and comprehensive response to overcome the coronavirus.\nSouth Africa has just emerged from the second wave of infections since COVID-19 arrived on our shores in March last year.\nDriven by a new variant of the virus, this second wave was more severe and cost many more lives than the first wave.\nNevertheless, the human cost could have been far greater.\nHad we not moved quickly to restrict movement and activity, had we not prepared our health facilities, had South Africans not observed the basic health protocols, the devastation caused by this virus could have been far worse.\nThis year, we must do everything in our means to contain and overcome this pandemic.\nThis means intensifying our prevention efforts and strengthening our health system.\nIt also means that we must undertake a massive vaccination programme to save lives and dramatically reduce infections across the population.\nEarlier this week, we were informed that one of the vaccines that we had procured, the AstraZeneca vaccine, offers minimal protection from mild to moderate infection by the new variant known as 501Y.v2.\nThis is according to early findings of a study by our scientists and researchers.\nWe applaud these scientists for leading this research and providing new evidence that is vital for guiding our response.\nSince this variant is now the dominant variant in our country, these findings have significant implications for the pace, design and sequencing of our vaccine programme.\nWhile it should not delay the start of the vaccination programme by much, it will affect the choice of vaccines and the manner of their deployment.\nThe first phase of our vaccination programme, which is targeted at health and other frontline workers, will now use the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which has been shown to be effective against the 501Y.V2 variant.\nWe have secured nine million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\nThe first batch, of 80 000 doses, will arrive in the country next week.\nFurther consignments will arrive over the next four weeks, totalling 500 000 Johnson & Johnson vaccines.\nAll provinces have rollout plans in place as the first vaccines come through.\nI wish to thank all provinces for their level of preparedness for this massive undertaking that we are about to embark upon.\nIn addition, we have secured 12 million vaccine doses from the global COVAX facility.\nThis will be complemented by other vaccines that are available to South Africa through the African Union’s (AU) African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team Facility.\nPfizer has committed 20 million vaccine doses, commencing with deliveries at the end of the first quarter.\nWe are continuing our engagements with all the vaccine manufacturers to ensure that we secure sufficient quantities of vaccines that are suitable to our conditions.\nThe health and safety of our people remains our paramount concern.\nAll medication imported into the country is monitored, evaluated, investigated, inspected and registered by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority.\nWe will continue to use the science-driven approach that has served us well since the earliest days of the pandemic.\nThe success of the vaccination programme will rely on active collaboration between all sectors of society.\nWe are greatly encouraged by the active involvement of business, labour, the health industry and medical schemes, in particular, in preparing for this mass vaccination drive.\nAs we have overcome before, we will overcome again and rise.\nBut it is not just this disease that we must defeat.\nWe must overcome poverty, hunger, joblessness and inequality.\nWe must overcome a legacy of exclusion and dispossession that continues to impoverish our people, and which this pandemic has severely worsened.\nWhen I delivered the SoNA in this House last year, none of us could have imagined how – within a matter of weeks – our country and our world would have changed so dramatically.\nOur plans had to be adapted in response to a global emergency.\nBudgets had to be reprioritised and many programmes had to be deferred.\nOver the past year, South Africa has experienced a sharp decline in growth and a significant increase in unemployment.\nPoverty is on the rise. Inequality is deepening.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, our economy was 6% smaller than it was in the last quarter of 2019.\nThere were 1,7 million fewer people employed in the third quarter of 2020 than there were in the first quarter, before the pandemic struck.\nOur unemployment rate now stands at a staggering 30,8%.\nAs a result of the relief measures that we implemented and the phased reopening of the economy, we expect to see a strong recovery in employment by the end of the year.\nAs we worked to contain the spread of the virus, we also had to take extraordinary measures to support ordinary South Africans, assist businesses in distress and protect people’s livelihoods.\nThe Social and Economic Relief Package that we introduced in April last year is the largest intervention of its kind in our history.\nIt identified measures worth a total of R500 billion – or about 10% of our gross domestic product – to provide cash directly to the poorest households, to provide wage support to workers and to provide various forms of relief to struggling businesses.\nA total of 18 million people, or close to one-third of the population, received additional grant payments through these relief measures.\nIt is estimated that this grant lifted more than five million people above the food poverty line, helping to alleviate hunger in a moment of great crisis.\nTo date, more than R57 billion in wage support has been paid to over 4,5 million workers through the special Unemployment Insurance Fund Temporary Employer-Employee Relief Scheme (TERS).\nMore than R1,3 billion has been provided in support mainly for small- and medium-sized businesses.\nIn addition, over R70 billion in tax relief was extended to businesses in distress.\nAround R18,9 billion in loans have been approved for 13 000 businesses through the Loan Guarantee Scheme.\nFellow South Africans,\nIt is nearly four months since I stood here before a joint sitting of this Parliament to present to the nation the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan.\nThis evening, we stand here not to make promises but to report on progress in the implementation of the recovery plan and the priority actions we must take to restore growth and create jobs.\nSince the launch of the plan, we have focused on four priority interventions:\n- a massive rollout of infrastructure throughout the country,\n- a massive increase in local production,\n- an employment stimulus to create jobs and support livelihoods, and\n- the rapid expansion of our energy generation capacity.\nWe announced that we would be embarking on a massive rollout of infrastructure throughout the country.\nWe knew that to achieve this objective we would need to steadily rebuild technical skills within government to prepare and manage large infrastructure projects.\nWe have now developed an infrastructure investment project pipeline worth R340 billion in network industries such as energy, water, transport and telecommunications.\nConstruction has started and progress is being made on a number of these projects.\nSince the announcement of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, we have launched two major human settlements projects that will provide homes to almost 68 000 households in the Gauteng province.\nSimilar human settlements projects are planned in other provinces.\nTwo years ago, I spoke about the dream of building new cities that will enable us to make a break with apartheid’s spatial development.\nNew post-apartheid cities are being conceptualised in a number of places in our country.\nThe Lanseria Smart City, the first new city to be built in a democratic South Africa, is now a reality in the making.\nThe draft masterplan for this smart city – which will become home to between 350 000 to 500 000 people within the next decade – was completed in November 2020 and is now out for public comment.\nProgress is being made on several major water infrastructure projects.\nThese include Phase 2A of the Mokolo and Crocodile River Project, and the uMkhomazi Water Project.\nThe Infrastructure Investment Plan identifies roads projects worth R19 billion covering the spine of the South African road network.\nWork is underway to finalise finance structuring for these projects.\nResources have been committed from the fiscus to support the construction and rehabilitation of the major N1, N2 and N3 highways.\nThese infrastructure projects will lead to the revival of the construction industry and the creation of much-needed jobs.\nThe R100 billion Infrastructure Fund is now in full operation.\nThis fund will blend resources from the fiscus with financing from the private sector and development institutions.\nIts approved project pipeline for 2021 is varied and includes the Student Housing Infrastructure Programme, which aims to provide 300 000 student beds.\nAnother approved project is SA Connect, a programme to roll out broadband to schools, hospitals, police stations and other government facilities.\nThe second priority intervention of the recovery plan is to support a massive increase in local production and to make South African exports globally competitive.\nThis will encourage greater investment by the private sector in productive activity.\nKey to this plan is a renewed commitment from government, business and organised labour to buy local.\nThis commitment should lead to increased local production, which will lead to the revival of our manufacturing industry.\nAll social partners that participated in the development of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, as part of our social compact, have agreed to work together to reduce our reliance on imports by 20% over the next five years.\nThey have identified 42 products – ranging from edible oils to furniture, fruit concentrates, personal protective equipment, steel products and green economy inputs – that can be sourced locally.\nIf we achieve our target, we will significantly expand our productive economy, potentially returning more than R200 billion to the country’s annual output.\nLast year, we undertook to create a larger market for small businesses and designate 1 000 locally produced products that must be procured from Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs).\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic forced the closure of global value chains, we have been able to speed up this initiative as the local supply chains became open for locally manufactured products.\nTo this end, Cabinet approved the SMME-Focused Localisation Policy Framework which identified the 1 000 products.\nFurthermore, the departments of Small Business Development and Trade, Industry and Competition are supporting SMMEs to access larger domestic and international markets.\nThese efforts are supported by robust manufacturing support programmes.\nIn the SoNA last year, I said that our vision for industrialisation is underpinned by sector master plans to rejuvenate and grow key industries.\nFour master plans that have been completed and signed to date – which are part of the social compact between labour, business, government and communities – have already had an impact in their respective industries.\nThrough the implementation of the Poultry Master Plan, the industry has invested R800 million to upgrade production.\nSouth Africa now produces an additional one million chickens every week.\nThe Sugar Master Plan was signed during the lockdown, with a commitment from large users of sugar to procure at least 80% of their sugar needs from local growers.\nThrough the implementation of the plan, last year saw a rise in local production and a decline in imported sugar, creating stability for an industry which employs some 85 000 workers.\nSupport for black small-scale farmers is being stepped up, with a large beverage producer committing to expand their procurement sharply.\nSince the signing of the Clothing, Textile, Footwear and Leather Masterplan in November 2019, the industry has invested more than half a billion rand to expand local manufacturing facilities, including SMMEs.\nWe have worked closely with the auto sector to help it weather the pandemic.\nBy the end of the year, the sector had recovered around 70% of its normal annual production, in difficult circumstances.\nLast week, the Ford Motor Company announced a R16 billion investment to expand their manufacturing facility in Tshwane for the next generation Ford Ranger bakkie.\nThis investment will support the growth of around 12 small and medium enterprises in automotive component manufacturing.\nNearly half of the procurement spend on construction of the bulk earthworks and top structure at the Tshwane Special Economic Zone during this phase is expected to be allocated for SMMEs, an amount equal to R1,7 billion in procurement opportunities.\nToyota has invested in its KwaZulu-Natal facility to start production of the first generation of hybrid electric vehicles to come off a South African assembly line.\nThis follows investment announcements by Nissan, Mercedes Benz and Isuzu in expanded production facilities, all of which cement South Africa’s position as a global player in auto manufacturing.\nThis year, our focus will be on getting the industry back to full production, implementing the Black Industrialist Fund and working on a new platform for expanded auto trade with the rest of the continent.\nThis will be part of our concerted effort to boost the manufacturing sector.\nThis year, we will begin to harness the opportunities presented by the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which came into operation on 1 January, following the adoption of the Johannesburg Declaration by the AU.\nThe AfCFTA provides a platform for South African businesses to expand into markets across the continent, and for South Africa to position itself as a gateway to the continent.\nTo address the deep inequalities in our society, we must accelerate the implementation of broad-based black economic empowerment policies on ownership, control and management of the economy.\nLast year, government agreed to landmark deals with companies that will advance black economic empowerment by transferring ownership to their workers.\nIn November last year, we held our third South Africa Investment Conference to review the implementation of previous commitments and to generate new investment into our economy.\nEven under difficult economic circumstances, the investment conference managed to raise some R108 billion in additional investment commitments.\nTogether with investment confirmed from the two previous conferences, we have now received R773 billion in investment commitments towards our five-year target of R1,2 trillion.\nFirms have reported that some R183 billion of these investments has already flowed into projects that benefit the South African economy.\nThis shows that our country is still an attractive investment destination for both local and offshore companies.\nWe have worked to facilitate investment by increasing the ease of doing business, including making it easier to start a business.\nIn the past year, more than 125 000 new companies were registered through the BizPortal platform, completing their registration in just a matter of hours from the comfort of their homes or offices.\nWe are making it easier for business to do business.\nOur third priority intervention is an employment stimulus to create jobs and support livelihoods.\nThe largest numbers of jobs will be created by the private sector in a number of industries as the economy recovers.\nWe continue to work in a social compact with the private sector to create a more conducive environment for them to be able to create jobs.\nOur compact with the private sector is underpinned by a clear commitment to grow our economy and to create jobs.\nHowever, the public sector has a responsibility to stimulate job creation; both through its policies and through direct job creation opportunities.\nThe Presidential Employment Stimulus is one of the most significant expansions of public and social employment in South Africa’s history.\nBy the end of January 2021, over 430 000 opportunities were already supported through the stimulus.\nA further 180 000 opportunities are currently in the recruitment process.\nThese opportunities are in areas like education, arts and culture, global business services, early childhood development (ECD), and small-scale and subsistence farming.\nIt involves environmental programmes such as the clearing of alien trees, wetland rehabilitation, fire prevention, and cleaning and greening across all municipalities.\nThese programmes are about real lives and real livelihoods.\nNearly half a million people are now receiving an income, developing new skills and contributing to their community and the country’s economy.\nWe will continue to support employment for as long as it is necessary while the labour market recovers, even as we work to promote stronger and more resilient growth in the private sector.\nIn the SoNA last year, in response to the huge challenge our country faces of youth unemployment, I announced that the National Youth Development Agency and the Department of Small Business Development would provide grant funding and business support to 1 000 young entrepreneurs within 100 days.\nWhile the programme had to be put on hold due to the coronavirus restrictions, it nevertheless managed to reach its target of 1 000 businesses by International Youth Day on 12 August 2020.\nThis provides a firm foundation for our efforts to support 15 000 start-ups by 2024.\nLast year, we said we would establish the National Pathway Management Network to provide support and opportunities to young people across the country.\nI want to encourage every young South African to join the more than 1,2 million people who are already in the network, and take their next steps to a better future.\nOf the many hardships our people had to experience last year, schooling disruption placed a huge burden on learners, teachers and families.\nDespite this, they persevered.\nIt is our priority for this year to regain lost time and improve educational outcomes, from the early years through to high school and post-school education and training.\nThe fourth priority intervention of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan is to rapidly expand energy generation capacity.\nRestoring Eskom to operational and financial health and accelerating its restructuring process is central to this objective.\nEskom has been restructured into three separate entities for generation, transmission and distribution.\nThis will lay the foundations for an efficient, modern and competitive energy system.\nEskom is making substantial progress with its intensive maintenance and operational excellence programmes to improve the reliability of its coal fleet.\nWe are working closely with Eskom on proposals to improve its financial position, manage its debt and reduce its dependence on the fiscus.\nThis requires a review of the tariff path to ensure that it reflects all reasonable costs and measures to resolve the problem of municipal debt.\nIn December 2020, government and its social partners signed the historic Eskom Social Compact, which outlines the necessary actions we must take, collectively and as individual constituencies, to meet the country’s energy needs now and into the future.\nOver the last year, we have taken action to urgently and substantially increase generation capacity in addition to what Eskom generates:\n- The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy will soon be announcing the successful bids for 2 000 megawatts (MW) of emergency power.\n- The necessary regulations have been amended and the requirements clarified for municipalities to buy power from independent power producers. Systems are being put in place to support qualifying municipalities.\n- Government will soon be initiating the procurement of an additional 11 800 MW of power from renewable energy, natural gas, battery storage and coal in line with the Integrated Resource Plan 2019.\nDespite this work, Eskom estimates that, without additional capacity, there will be an electricity supply shortfall of between 4 000 and 6 000 MW over the next five years, as old coal-fired power stations reach their end of life.\nAs part of the measures to address this shortfall, we will in the coming weeks issue a request for proposals for 2 600 MW from wind and solar energy as part of Bid Window 5.\nThis will be followed by another bid window in August 2021.\nRecent analysis suggests that easing the licensing requirements for new embedded generation projects could unlock up to 5 000 MW of additional capacity and help to ease the impact of load shedding.\nWe will therefore amend Schedule 2 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 2006 (Act 4 of 2006) within the next three months to increase the licensing threshold for embedded generation.\nThis will include consultation among key stakeholders on the level at which the new threshold should be set and the finalisation of the necessary enabling frameworks.\nEskom has already started work to expedite its commercial and technical processes to allow this additional capacity onto the grid without undue delay.\nAs we mobilise all of the resources at our disposal to support economic recovery, we cannot lose sight of the threat that climate change poses to our environmental health, socioeconomic development and economic growth.\nWe are, therefore, working to fulfil our commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement which include the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\nEskom, our largest greenhouse gas emitter, has committed in principle to net zero emission by 2050 and to increase its renewable capacity.\nEskom will be looking to partner with investors to repurpose and repower part of its coal fleet.\nThis will be done in a way that stimulates investment, local economic activity and local manufacturing, as part of a just transition.\nOur work on climate change will be guided by the Presidential Coordinating Commission on Climate Change, which is meeting for the first time this month.\nThe commission will work on a plan for a just transition to a low-carbon economy and climate resilient society.\nWe will not achieve higher rates of growth and employment if we do not implement structural economic reforms.\nThese reforms are necessary to reduce costs and barriers to entry, increase competition, stimulate new investment and create space for new entrants in the market.\nThis work is being driven through Operation Vulindlela, which involves a team in the National Treasury and the President’s office.\nOperation Vulindlela is focusing on reforms in the electricity, water, telecommunications and transport sectors, as well as reforms to our visa and immigration regime.\nThe completion of digital migration is vital to our ability to effectively harness the enormous opportunities presented by technological change.\nAfter many delays, we will begin the phased switch-off of our analogue television transmitters from next month.\nIt is anticipated that this process, which will be done province-by-province, will be completed by the end of March 2022.\nThe process for the licensing of high-demand spectrum is at an advanced stage.\nWe hope that the ongoing litigation on the licensing matter will provide legal certainty and will not unduly delay the spectrum auction process.\nIn the water sector, we are working through Operation Vulindlela to ensure that water license applications are finalised within the revised timeframe of 90 days; and to revive the Green Drop and Blue Drop programmes to strengthen water quality monitoring.\nWe will finalise and implement the revised Raw Water Pricing Strategy, and accelerate the establishment of a national water resources infrastructure agency.\nOur ability to compete in global markets depends on the efficiency of our ports and rail network.\nWe are repositioning Durban as a hub port for the Southern Hemisphere and developing Ngqura as the container terminal of choice.\nThe rail corridor from Gauteng is being extended to enable the export of vehicles through Port Elizabeth.\nThese are crucial steps to move freight from road to rail and increase the competitiveness of the rail system.\nWork is underway with the relevant departments to reform our visa and immigration regime to attract skills and grow the tourism sector.\nAs international travel starts to recover in the wake of COVID-19, we will undertake a full rollout of eVisas to visitors from China, India, Nigeria, Kenya and 10 other countries.\nThe revised list of critical skills will be published for public comment by the Department of Home Affairs, within one week, to ensure that the final version reflects the skills needed by the economy.\nThe momentum that Operation Vulindlela has already built, and the support that it has received across government, shows that we are serious about reform.\nWe will continue to work relentlessly and without pause to create a more modern, efficient and competitive economy that is more open to all South Africans.\nTo support our reform process, the Presidential State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Council has outlined a clear set of reforms that will enable these vital public companies to fulfil their mandate for growth and development.\nOverarching legislation for state-owned companies will be tabled in Cabinet this financial year and in Parliament in the next the financial year.\nA centralised SOE model is being implemented this financial year, which will ensure a standardised governance, financial management and operational performance framework for all SOEs.\nThe mandates of all SOEs are being re-evaluated to ensure that they are responsive to the country’s needs and the implementation of the National Development Plan.\nIn the midst of the economic damage caused by COVID-19, South Africa’s agricultural sector has performed remarkably well.\nIn 2020, we became the world’s second-largest exporter of citrus, with strong export growth in wine, maize, nuts, deciduous fruit and sugar cane.\nThe favourable weather conditions in 2020 and the beginning of 2021 mean that agriculture is likely to grow in the near term.\nThis provides an opportunity for further public-private partnership in agriculture to promote transformation and ensure sustainable growth.\nIt is an opportunity to accelerate land redistribution through a variety of instruments such as land restitution and expropriation of land in order to boost agricultural output.\nTo date, government has redistributed over five million hectares (ha) of land, totalling around 5 500 farms, to more than 300 000 beneficiaries.\nThis is in addition to the land restitution process, which has benefited over two million land claimants and resulted in the transfer of around 2,7 million ha.\nWe are also pursuing programmes to assist smallholder and emerging farmers with market access, to develop skills across the entire agricultural value chain and increase the number of commercial black farmers.\nDuring the course of the next financial year, we will establish a land and agrarian reform agency to fast-track land reform.\nThe Public Service is at the coalface of government, and lack of professionalism does not just impact service delivery; it also dents public confidence.\nAdvancing honesty, ethics and integrity in the Public Service is critical if we are to build a capable state.\nThrough the National School of Government, we continue to roll out courses and training programmes for government officials from entry level to senior management and the Executive.\nIn October last year, I signed off on ministerial performance agreements with all Ministers, which have now been published online.\nThis will enhance accountability and focused performance by members of the Executive.\nWe remain on course to build a capable and professional civil service that delivers on its mandate and is accountable to the South African people.\nWe are proceeding with our efforts to strengthen the local government infrastructure and accelerate service delivery through the District Development Model.\nThe model brings all three spheres of government to focus on key priorities and implementation of critical high impact projects.\nWorking with both public and private sector partners, government is implementing a range of measures to support municipalities to address inadequate and inconsistent service delivery in areas such water provision, infrastructure build and maintenance.\nWe are focusing on the appointment of properly qualified officials at a local level to ensure effective management and provision of services.\nAs we prepare for local government elections, which are due take place this year, we will need to adjust to the conditions forced upon us by COVID-19 to ensure that the people of this country can determine who represents them at this crucial level of government.\nFellow South Africans,\nCorruption is one of the greatest impediments to the country’s growth and development.\nThe revelations from the Zondo Commission of Inquiry lay bare the extent of state capture and related corruption.\nTestimony at the commission has shown how the criminal justice system was compromised and weakened.\nIt is, therefore, vital that we sustain the momentum of the rebuilding effort that we began three years ago.\nThere has been great progress in turning around law enforcement bodies.\nCritical leadership positions have been filled with capable, experienced and trustworthy professionals.\nThere is improved cooperation and sharing of resources between the respective law enforcement agencies, enabling a more integrated approach to investigations and prosecutions.\nWe have started implementation of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy, which lays the basis for a comprehensive and integrated society-wide response to corruption.\nWe will shortly be appointing members of the National Anti-Corruption Advisory Council, which is a multi-sectoral body that will oversee the initial implementation of the strategy and the establishment of an independent statutory anti-corruption body that reports to Parliament.\nWhen reports started to surface last year about possible fraud and corruption in the procurement of COVID-19-related goods and services, we acted decisively to put a stop to these practices, to investigate all allegations and to act against those responsible.\nWe established a fusion centre, which brings together key law enforcement agencies to share information and resources.\nThe fusion centre has brought many cases to trial and preserved or recovered millions of rands in public funds.\nThe Special Investigating Unit (SIU) was authorised to investigate allegations of unlawful conduct with respect to COVID-19 procurement by all state bodies during the National State of Disaster.\nAs it reported last week, the SIU has finalised investigations into 164 contracts with a total value of R3,5 billion.\nIn a significant advance for transparency and accountability, the Political Party Funding Act, 2018 (Act 6 of 2018) will come into operation on 1 April this year.\nThis will regulate public and private funding of political parties. Among other things, it requires the disclosure of donations to parties and establishes two funds that will enable represented political parties to undertake their programmes.\nCrime and violence continue to undermine people’s sense of safety and security.\nTackling crime is central to the success of our recovery.\nCrimes like cable theft, railway infrastructure vandalism, land invasions, construction site disruptions and attacks on truck drivers hamper economic activity and discourage investment.\nWe have taken steps and will continue to stop these crimes and deal with those responsible in terms of the law.\nTask teams have been set up in a number of provinces to deal with extortion and violence on sites of economic activity.\nWe are also fast-tracking the implementation and capacitation of the Border Management Agency to curb illegal immigration and cross-border crime.\nEnding gender-based violence (GBV) is imperative if we lay claim to being a society rooted in equality and non-sexism.\nWhen I launched the National Strategic Plan on Gender-Based Violence and Femicide (GBVF) in April last year, I made a promise to the women and children of this country that we were going to strengthen the Criminal Justice System to prevent them being traumatised again, and to ensure that perpetrators face justice.\nTo give effect to this, three key pieces of legislation were introduced in Parliament last year to make the criminal justice system more effective in combatting GBV.\nTo ensure that perpetrators are brought to book, we are making progress in reducing the backlog of GBV cases.\nWe continue to provide care and support to survivors of GBV.\nIn the SoNA last year, I said that we would prioritise the economic empowerment of women.\nLast year, Cabinet approved a policy that 40% of public procurement should go to women-owned businesses and entities.\nSeveral departments have started implementing this policy and are making progress.\nLast week, we also launched a groundbreaking private sector-led GBVF Response Fund.\nSeveral South African companies and global philanthropies made pledges to the value of R128 million.\nOver the next three years, government will allocate approximately R12 billion to implement the various components of the National Strategic Plan.\nGBV will only end when everyone takes responsibility for doing so in their homes, in their communities, in their workplaces, in their places of worship and in their schools.\nEqually, we need to give attention to issues affecting children, including improving school-readiness, ECD planning and funding, protection against preventable diseases, policy reform around child welfare and reducing violence against children.\nIn the year ahead, we are also going to forge ahead with efforts to provide greater opportunities for persons with disabilities to participate in the economy and in society in general.\nAs we rebuild our economy in the midst of a pandemic, it is necessary that we continue – within our means – to provide support to those businesses and individuals that continue to be most affected.\nBusinesses in several sectors are still struggling and many families continue to suffer as the job market slowly recovers.\nOver the last few months, we have had ongoing discussions with our social partners in business, labour and community-based organisations, who proposed an extension of some of the social and economic support.\nWe have, therefore, decided to extend the period for the Special COVID-19 Grant of R350 by a further three months.\nThis has proven to be an effective and efficient short-term measure to reduce the immediate impact on the livelihoods of poor South Africans.\nWe have also decided to extend the COVID-19 TERS benefit until 15 March 2021, only for those sectors that have not been able to open and operate.\nThe conditions of this extension and the sectors to be included will be announced after consultations with social partners at the National Economic Development and Labour Council.\nThe National Treasury will work with its partners and stakeholders on improvements to the Loan Guarantee Scheme so that it better addresses the realities of SMMEs and other businesses as they strive to recover.\nWe will work with our social partners to ensure that these and other interventions provide the relief to those who most need it.\nFellow South Africans,\nJust as a harsh fire gives new life to our country’s fynbos, this crisis is an opportunity to build a different, better South Africa.\nRebuilding our country requires a common effort.\nIt requires that all South African take responsibility and play their part.\nLet us work together as government, as business, as labour, as political parties and as all of society to clear away the rubble and lay a new foundation.\nAbove all, let us return this country to the values upon which it was founded.\nOn the day of his release, 31 years ago, Madiba gave his first public address here in Cape Town, where he reminded South Africans that there were difficult days ahead, and that the battle was far from won.\nMadiba said:\n“Now is the time to intensify

No, that's not true: mRNA vaccines do not alter human genes. Cytokine storms, an immune system overreaction, are an occasional symptom of COVID-19, treated with the same steroids as those administered to former President Donald Trump. A UCLA infectious disease expert and clinician who treats COVID patients said his literature search found no reports of a surge of lethal \"cytokine storm\" deaths caused by mRNA vaccines and the FDA refutes claims of gene alteration and high risk of adverse reactions.\nThe claims originated in a video published by BitChute on December 31, 2020, titled \"Why People Will Start Dying A Few Months After The First mRNA 'Vaccinations'\" (archived here) which opened:\nThe cytokine storm as an antibody dependent response of the human body Mirrored from: https://www.bitchute.com/video/A5wDhtDdYdVe/\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\nWhy People Will Start Dying A Few Months After The First mRNA \"Vaccinations\"\nThe cytokine storm as an antibody dependent response of the human body Mirrored from: https://www.bitchute.com/video/A5wDhtDdYdVe/\nAppearing on the video is Dolores Cahill, a professor of translational medicine at University College, Dublin, Medical School who holds a Ph.D. in immunology.\nDiscussing her theory at length while displaying on-screen a 2012 research paper about SARS vaccines, Cahill tells viewers to fear mRNA vaccines for COVID-19, which she says will soon be causing deaths:\nThis mRNA, why it's so deadly is that it now goes into your genes and starts expressing and it starts stimulating the immune response from inside your body and it literally, you can't get rid of it, because the source of the viral protein ... you now become like a genetically modified organism...people will die, they'll go into like septic shock and then they'll go into organ failure within three four or five days and they will die if they don't get them seen.\nBut Prof. Timothy Brewer, a UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine infectious disease researcher who is also involved in treating COVID patients, said Cahill has it backward. In a February 9, 2021, phone interview with Lead Stories, he said she is wrong on the science:\nOne of the advantages of mRNA vaccines is they do not integrate at all and they don't even get into the nucleus of the cell. All the action happens in the cytoplasm so there's no concern about any genetic modification.\nBrewer cited a 2018 research review in Nature Review that describes the state of the science of mRNA vaccination six years after the paper Cahill points to in the video. Lead Stories in December researched and debunked a claim that messenger RNA would rewire the human genome. That's not how it works.\nFDA spokesperson Alison Hunt confirmed that in a February 16, 2021 email to Lead Stories, writing:\nThe two authorized COVID-19 vaccines contain mRNA. After the mRNA enters the cell it is translated into the virus spike protein. The mRNA does not enter the nucleus of the cell. The body breaks down mRNA within a matter of hours; once the mRNA is degraded, no more antigen can be synthesized.\nBrewer said one of the problems mRNA vaccine research had to solve was the tendency of the messenger material - which triggers cells to make proteins that trigger the body's immune reaction -- to break down and not last long enough in the body to be effective. \"It's been the opposite problem,\" to the one Cahill described, Brewer said. \"The mRNA would degrade too quickly or it would not get into the cells.\" New approaches have packaged the messenger RNA so that it can trigger the body to develop defenses against the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID.\nBrewer said cytokine storms -- an overly vigorous immune response -- have been a problem for a few COVID patients. From the beginning of the pandemic, clinical workers like Brewer have observed that some patients in the late stages of the disease suffer more from the over-reaction of their immune system than from the damage done by the virus itself. Steroids like dexamethasone have proven effective in tamping down the reaction, he said. That is one of the drugs administered to Donald Trump after he tested positive for COVID-19.\nBrewer said he has found no research or reports of mRNA vaccines causing the cytokine storms predicted by Cahill, who is not a medical doctor and not a clinician treating patients.\nFDA spokesperson Hunt said both mRNA vaccines were not made available under the Emergency Use Authorization until FDA had reviewed effectiveness findings and safety data from \"clinical trials conducted in tens of thousands of study participants.\" She said the trials are conducted to the standards set forth by the FDA and, she wrote, were convincing:\nFDA has determined that the totality of the available data provides clear evidence that both vaccines may be effective in preventing COVID-19 and support that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks of the vaccine's use in millions of people, including healthy individuals.\nHunt said clinical trials will continue, to track the safety and effectiveness. Plus, manufacturers will carry out continuing studies to track occurrence of pre-specified adverse events of special interest, plus deaths and hospitalizations.\nLead Stories has been unable to obtain original public statement documents, but the Irish Times reported February 10, 2021, that University College, Dublin, Medical School has disassociated itself from Cahill's statements about COVID-19 and that the EU has asked her to resign as vice-chair of a multinational medical innovations organization, saying her statements about COVID could cause significant harm if taken literally.\nUpdates:\n-\n2021-02-16T23:20:12Z 2021-02-16T23:20:12ZUpdated to add U.S. Food and Drug Administration comments about gene therapy and about safety testing of mRNA vaccines."}, {"claim": "By the end of January 2021, over 430,000 opportunities have already been supported through south africas Presidential Employment Stimulus.

It is wondrous in its diversity.\nOur national flower, the Protea, is a species of fynbos.\nWhen I opened the third National Investment Conference last year, I spoke of the Protea's unique properties that in so many ways resemble our national character.\nWhat is most unique and special about fynbos is that to be sustainable and survive, it needs fire.\nAt least once every twenty years, fynbos must burn at extremely high temperatures to allow the ecosystem to be rejuvenated and grow afresh.\nThroughout the summer, the burned foliage lies desolate. But when the autumn rains return, the seeds germinate, and its life cycle begins all over again.\nThe mountains bloom with new life as plants which once seemed lost grow back even stronger than before.\nWe, the people of South Africa, have over the past year experienced a terrible hardship.\nLike a wildfire that sweeps across the mountainous ranges where the fynbos grows, a deadly pandemic has swept across the world, leaving devastation in its path.\nAnd yet, like the hardy fynbos of our native land, we too have proven to be resilient in many ways.\nFor three centuries, we were victims of oppression, dispossession and injustice.\nAnd for three centuries, we resisted.\nThe flames of injustice may have scarred us, but they did not consume us.\nThe rains of democracy brought rejuvenation and the birth of a new nation.\nWe have risen time and time again from the depths of darkness to herald a new day.\nAs we look on the grave damage that this disease has caused, we know that like the fynbos, like all those who have walked this land before us, we will rise again.\nNearly a year has passed since South Africa saw its first case of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19.\nSince then, nearly one-and-a-half million people in our country are known to have been infected by the virus.\nMore than 45 000 people are known to have died.\nBeyond these statistics lies a human story of tragedy and pain.\nThere is no family, no community and no place of work that has not lost someone they knew, worked with and loved.\nIt is also a story of courage and resilience.\nThe resilience of the hospital worker who – day after day, night after night – goes to work to save lives, knowing that they, themselves, are at risk of infection.\nIt is a wonderful account of the courage of the police officer, the soldier, the essential worker, the carer and all those on the frontline, who have kept our country safe, our people fed and our economy going.\nIt is a story of solidarity and compassion.\nOf a nation that has stood together to confront COVID-19 in ways not seen since the early days of our democracy.\nMore than anything else, this crisis has revealed the true character of our remarkable nation.\nIt has revealed a spirit of the people who refused to be defeated.\nIt is this South African spirit that must drive our resolve to build a new and more equal economy and a better, more just society.\nThe year ahead must be a time for change, for progress and for rebirth.\nIt must be a year in which we rise.\nThis is no ordinary year, and this is no ordinary SoNA.\nI will therefore, focus this evening on the foremost, overriding priorities of 2021.\nFirst, we must defeat the coronavirus pandemic.\nSecond, we must accelerate our economic recovery.\nThird, we must implement economic reforms to create sustainable jobs and drive inclusive growth.\nAnd finally, we must fight corruption and strengthen the State.\nIn the coming weeks, we will address the other important elements of government’s programme for the year.\nFundamental to our nation’s recovery is an unrelenting and comprehensive response to overcome the coronavirus.\nSouth Africa has just emerged from the second wave of infections since COVID-19 arrived on our shores in March last year.\nDriven by a new variant of the virus, this second wave was more severe and cost many more lives than the first wave.\nNevertheless, the human cost could have been far greater.\nHad we not moved quickly to restrict movement and activity, had we not prepared our health facilities, had South Africans not observed the basic health protocols, the devastation caused by this virus could have been far worse.\nThis year, we must do everything in our means to contain and overcome this pandemic.\nThis means intensifying our prevention efforts and strengthening our health system.\nIt also means that we must undertake a massive vaccination programme to save lives and dramatically reduce infections across the population.\nEarlier this week, we were informed that one of the vaccines that we had procured, the AstraZeneca vaccine, offers minimal protection from mild to moderate infection by the new variant known as 501Y.v2.\nThis is according to early findings of a study by our scientists and researchers.\nWe applaud these scientists for leading this research and providing new evidence that is vital for guiding our response.\nSince this variant is now the dominant variant in our country, these findings have significant implications for the pace, design and sequencing of our vaccine programme.\nWhile it should not delay the start of the vaccination programme by much, it will affect the choice of vaccines and the manner of their deployment.\nThe first phase of our vaccination programme, which is targeted at health and other frontline workers, will now use the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which has been shown to be effective against the 501Y.V2 variant.\nWe have secured nine million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\nThe first batch, of 80 000 doses, will arrive in the country next week.\nFurther consignments will arrive over the next four weeks, totalling 500 000 Johnson & Johnson vaccines.\nAll provinces have rollout plans in place as the first vaccines come through.\nI wish to thank all provinces for their level of preparedness for this massive undertaking that we are about to embark upon.\nIn addition, we have secured 12 million vaccine doses from the global COVAX facility.\nThis will be complemented by other vaccines that are available to South Africa through the African Union’s (AU) African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team Facility.\nPfizer has committed 20 million vaccine doses, commencing with deliveries at the end of the first quarter.\nWe are continuing our engagements with all the vaccine manufacturers to ensure that we secure sufficient quantities of vaccines that are suitable to our conditions.\nThe health and safety of our people remains our paramount concern.\nAll medication imported into the country is monitored, evaluated, investigated, inspected and registered by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority.\nWe will continue to use the science-driven approach that has served us well since the earliest days of the pandemic.\nThe success of the vaccination programme will rely on active collaboration between all sectors of society.\nWe are greatly encouraged by the active involvement of business, labour, the health industry and medical schemes, in particular, in preparing for this mass vaccination drive.\nAs we have overcome before, we will overcome again and rise.\nBut it is not just this disease that we must defeat.\nWe must overcome poverty, hunger, joblessness and inequality.\nWe must overcome a legacy of exclusion and dispossession that continues to impoverish our people, and which this pandemic has severely worsened.\nWhen I delivered the SoNA in this House last year, none of us could have imagined how – within a matter of weeks – our country and our world would have changed so dramatically.\nOur plans had to be adapted in response to a global emergency.\nBudgets had to be reprioritised and many programmes had to be deferred.\nOver the past year, South Africa has experienced a sharp decline in growth and a significant increase in unemployment.\nPoverty is on the rise. Inequality is deepening.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, our economy was 6% smaller than it was in the last quarter of 2019.\nThere were 1,7 million fewer people employed in the third quarter of 2020 than there were in the first quarter, before the pandemic struck.\nOur unemployment rate now stands at a staggering 30,8%.\nAs a result of the relief measures that we implemented and the phased reopening of the economy, we expect to see a strong recovery in employment by the end of the year.\nAs we worked to contain the spread of the virus, we also had to take extraordinary measures to support ordinary South Africans, assist businesses in distress and protect people’s livelihoods.\nThe Social and Economic Relief Package that we introduced in April last year is the largest intervention of its kind in our history.\nIt identified measures worth a total of R500 billion – or about 10% of our gross domestic product – to provide cash directly to the poorest households, to provide wage support to workers and to provide various forms of relief to struggling businesses.\nA total of 18 million people, or close to one-third of the population, received additional grant payments through these relief measures.\nIt is estimated that this grant lifted more than five million people above the food poverty line, helping to alleviate hunger in a moment of great crisis.\nTo date, more than R57 billion in wage support has been paid to over 4,5 million workers through the special Unemployment Insurance Fund Temporary Employer-Employee Relief Scheme (TERS).\nMore than R1,3 billion has been provided in support mainly for small- and medium-sized businesses.\nIn addition, over R70 billion in tax relief was extended to businesses in distress.\nAround R18,9 billion in loans have been approved for 13 000 businesses through the Loan Guarantee Scheme.\nFellow South Africans,\nIt is nearly four months since I stood here before a joint sitting of this Parliament to present to the nation the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan.\nThis evening, we stand here not to make promises but to report on progress in the implementation of the recovery plan and the priority actions we must take to restore growth and create jobs.\nSince the launch of the plan, we have focused on four priority interventions:\n- a massive rollout of infrastructure throughout the country,\n- a massive increase in local production,\n- an employment stimulus to create jobs and support livelihoods, and\n- the rapid expansion of our energy generation capacity.\nWe announced that we would be embarking on a massive rollout of infrastructure throughout the country.\nWe knew that to achieve this objective we would need to steadily rebuild technical skills within government to prepare and manage large infrastructure projects.\nWe have now developed an infrastructure investment project pipeline worth R340 billion in network industries such as energy, water, transport and telecommunications.\nConstruction has started and progress is being made on a number of these projects.\nSince the announcement of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, we have launched two major human settlements projects that will provide homes to almost 68 000 households in the Gauteng province.\nSimilar human settlements projects are planned in other provinces.\nTwo years ago, I spoke about the dream of building new cities that will enable us to make a break with apartheid’s spatial development.\nNew post-apartheid cities are being conceptualised in a number of places in our country.\nThe Lanseria Smart City, the first new city to be built in a democratic South Africa, is now a reality in the making.\nThe draft masterplan for this smart city – which will become home to between 350 000 to 500 000 people within the next decade – was completed in November 2020 and is now out for public comment.\nProgress is being made on several major water infrastructure projects.\nThese include Phase 2A of the Mokolo and Crocodile River Project, and the uMkhomazi Water Project.\nThe Infrastructure Investment Plan identifies roads projects worth R19 billion covering the spine of the South African road network.\nWork is underway to finalise finance structuring for these projects.\nResources have been committed from the fiscus to support the construction and rehabilitation of the major N1, N2 and N3 highways.\nThese infrastructure projects will lead to the revival of the construction industry and the creation of much-needed jobs.\nThe R100 billion Infrastructure Fund is now in full operation.\nThis fund will blend resources from the fiscus with financing from the private sector and development institutions.\nIts approved project pipeline for 2021 is varied and includes the Student Housing Infrastructure Programme, which aims to provide 300 000 student beds.\nAnother approved project is SA Connect, a programme to roll out broadband to schools, hospitals, police stations and other government facilities.\nThe second priority intervention of the recovery plan is to support a massive increase in local production and to make South African exports globally competitive.\nThis will encourage greater investment by the private sector in productive activity.\nKey to this plan is a renewed commitment from government, business and organised labour to buy local.\nThis commitment should lead to increased local production, which will lead to the revival of our manufacturing industry.\nAll social partners that participated in the development of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, as part of our social compact, have agreed to work together to reduce our reliance on imports by 20% over the next five years.\nThey have identified 42 products – ranging from edible oils to furniture, fruit concentrates, personal protective equipment, steel products and green economy inputs – that can be sourced locally.\nIf we achieve our target, we will significantly expand our productive economy, potentially returning more than R200 billion to the country’s annual output.\nLast year, we undertook to create a larger market for small businesses and designate 1 000 locally produced products that must be procured from Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs).\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic forced the closure of global value chains, we have been able to speed up this initiative as the local supply chains became open for locally manufactured products.\nTo this end, Cabinet approved the SMME-Focused Localisation Policy Framework which identified the 1 000 products.\nFurthermore, the departments of Small Business Development and Trade, Industry and Competition are supporting SMMEs to access larger domestic and international markets.\nThese efforts are supported by robust manufacturing support programmes.\nIn the SoNA last year, I said that our vision for industrialisation is underpinned by sector master plans to rejuvenate and grow key industries.\nFour master plans that have been completed and signed to date – which are part of the social compact between labour, business, government and communities – have already had an impact in their respective industries.\nThrough the implementation of the Poultry Master Plan, the industry has invested R800 million to upgrade production.\nSouth Africa now produces an additional one million chickens every week.\nThe Sugar Master Plan was signed during the lockdown, with a commitment from large users of sugar to procure at least 80% of their sugar needs from local growers.\nThrough the implementation of the plan, last year saw a rise in local production and a decline in imported sugar, creating stability for an industry which employs some 85 000 workers.\nSupport for black small-scale farmers is being stepped up, with a large beverage producer committing to expand their procurement sharply.\nSince the signing of the Clothing, Textile, Footwear and Leather Masterplan in November 2019, the industry has invested more than half a billion rand to expand local manufacturing facilities, including SMMEs.\nWe have worked closely with the auto sector to help it weather the pandemic.\nBy the end of the year, the sector had recovered around 70% of its normal annual production, in difficult circumstances.\nLast week, the Ford Motor Company announced a R16 billion investment to expand their manufacturing facility in Tshwane for the next generation Ford Ranger bakkie.\nThis investment will support the growth of around 12 small and medium enterprises in automotive component manufacturing.\nNearly half of the procurement spend on construction of the bulk earthworks and top structure at the Tshwane Special Economic Zone during this phase is expected to be allocated for SMMEs, an amount equal to R1,7 billion in procurement opportunities.\nToyota has invested in its KwaZulu-Natal facility to start production of the first generation of hybrid electric vehicles to come off a South African assembly line.\nThis follows investment announcements by Nissan, Mercedes Benz and Isuzu in expanded production facilities, all of which cement South Africa’s position as a global player in auto manufacturing.\nThis year, our focus will be on getting the industry back to full production, implementing the Black Industrialist Fund and working on a new platform for expanded auto trade with the rest of the continent.\nThis will be part of our concerted effort to boost the manufacturing sector.\nThis year, we will begin to harness the opportunities presented by the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which came into operation on 1 January, following the adoption of the Johannesburg Declaration by the AU.\nThe AfCFTA provides a platform for South African businesses to expand into markets across the continent, and for South Africa to position itself as a gateway to the continent.\nTo address the deep inequalities in our society, we must accelerate the implementation of broad-based black economic empowerment policies on ownership, control and management of the economy.\nLast year, government agreed to landmark deals with companies that will advance black economic empowerment by transferring ownership to their workers.\nIn November last year, we held our third South Africa Investment Conference to review the implementation of previous commitments and to generate new investment into our economy.\nEven under difficult economic circumstances, the investment conference managed to raise some R108 billion in additional investment commitments.\nTogether with investment confirmed from the two previous conferences, we have now received R773 billion in investment commitments towards our five-year target of R1,2 trillion.\nFirms have reported that some R183 billion of these investments has already flowed into projects that benefit the South African economy.\nThis shows that our country is still an attractive investment destination for both local and offshore companies.\nWe have worked to facilitate investment by increasing the ease of doing business, including making it easier to start a business.\nIn the past year, more than 125 000 new companies were registered through the BizPortal platform, completing their registration in just a matter of hours from the comfort of their homes or offices.\nWe are making it easier for business to do business.\nOur third priority intervention is an employment stimulus to create jobs and support livelihoods.\nThe largest numbers of jobs will be created by the private sector in a number of industries as the economy recovers.\nWe continue to work in a social compact with the private sector to create a more conducive environment for them to be able to create jobs.\nOur compact with the private sector is underpinned by a clear commitment to grow our economy and to create jobs.\nHowever, the public sector has a responsibility to stimulate job creation; both through its policies and through direct job creation opportunities.\nThe Presidential Employment Stimulus is one of the most significant expansions of public and social employment in South Africa’s history.\nBy the end of January 2021, over 430 000 opportunities were already supported through the stimulus.\nA further 180 000 opportunities are currently in the recruitment process.\nThese opportunities are in areas like education, arts and culture, global business services, early childhood development (ECD), and small-scale and subsistence farming.\nIt involves environmental programmes such as the clearing of alien trees, wetland rehabilitation, fire prevention, and cleaning and greening across all municipalities.\nThese programmes are about real lives and real livelihoods.\nNearly half a million people are now receiving an income, developing new skills and contributing to their community and the country’s economy.\nWe will continue to support employment for as long as it is necessary while the labour market recovers, even as we work to promote stronger and more resilient growth in the private sector.\nIn the SoNA last year, in response to the huge challenge our country faces of youth unemployment, I announced that the National Youth Development Agency and the Department of Small Business Development would provide grant funding and business support to 1 000 young entrepreneurs within 100 days.\nWhile the programme had to be put on hold due to the coronavirus restrictions, it nevertheless managed to reach its target of 1 000 businesses by International Youth Day on 12 August 2020.\nThis provides a firm foundation for our efforts to support 15 000 start-ups by 2024.\nLast year, we said we would establish the National Pathway Management Network to provide support and opportunities to young people across the country.\nI want to encourage every young South African to join the more than 1,2 million people who are already in the network, and take their next steps to a better future.\nOf the many hardships our people had to experience last year, schooling disruption placed a huge burden on learners, teachers and families.\nDespite this, they persevered.\nIt is our priority for this year to regain lost time and improve educational outcomes, from the early years through to high school and post-school education and training.\nThe fourth priority intervention of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan is to rapidly expand energy generation capacity.\nRestoring Eskom to operational and financial health and accelerating its restructuring process is central to this objective.\nEskom has been restructured into three separate entities for generation, transmission and distribution.\nThis will lay the foundations for an efficient, modern and competitive energy system.\nEskom is making substantial progress with its intensive maintenance and operational excellence programmes to improve the reliability of its coal fleet.\nWe are working closely with Eskom on proposals to improve its financial position, manage its debt and reduce its dependence on the fiscus.\nThis requires a review of the tariff path to ensure that it reflects all reasonable costs and measures to resolve the problem of municipal debt.\nIn December 2020, government and its social partners signed the historic Eskom Social Compact, which outlines the necessary actions we must take, collectively and as individual constituencies, to meet the country’s energy needs now and into the future.\nOver the last year, we have taken action to urgently and substantially increase generation capacity in addition to what Eskom generates:\n- The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy will soon be announcing the successful bids for 2 000 megawatts (MW) of emergency power.\n- The necessary regulations have been amended and the requirements clarified for municipalities to buy power from independent power producers. Systems are being put in place to support qualifying municipalities.\n- Government will soon be initiating the procurement of an additional 11 800 MW of power from renewable energy, natural gas, battery storage and coal in line with the Integrated Resource Plan 2019.\nDespite this work, Eskom estimates that, without additional capacity, there will be an electricity supply shortfall of between 4 000 and 6 000 MW over the next five years, as old coal-fired power stations reach their end of life.\nAs part of the measures to address this shortfall, we will in the coming weeks issue a request for proposals for 2 600 MW from wind and solar energy as part of Bid Window 5.\nThis will be followed by another bid window in August 2021.\nRecent analysis suggests that easing the licensing requirements for new embedded generation projects could unlock up to 5 000 MW of additional capacity and help to ease the impact of load shedding.\nWe will therefore amend Schedule 2 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 2006 (Act 4 of 2006) within the next three months to increase the licensing threshold for embedded generation.\nThis will include consultation among key stakeholders on the level at which the new threshold should be set and the finalisation of the necessary enabling frameworks.\nEskom has already started work to expedite its commercial and technical processes to allow this additional capacity onto the grid without undue delay.\nAs we mobilise all of the resources at our disposal to support economic recovery, we cannot lose sight of the threat that climate change poses to our environmental health, socioeconomic development and economic growth.\nWe are, therefore, working to fulfil our commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement which include the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\nEskom, our largest greenhouse gas emitter, has committed in principle to net zero emission by 2050 and to increase its renewable capacity.\nEskom will be looking to partner with investors to repurpose and repower part of its coal fleet.\nThis will be done in a way that stimulates investment, local economic activity and local manufacturing, as part of a just transition.\nOur work on climate change will be guided by the Presidential Coordinating Commission on Climate Change, which is meeting for the first time this month.\nThe commission will work on a plan for a just transition to a low-carbon economy and climate resilient society.\nWe will not achieve higher rates of growth and employment if we do not implement structural economic reforms.\nThese reforms are necessary to reduce costs and barriers to entry, increase competition, stimulate new investment and create space for new entrants in the market.\nThis work is being driven through Operation Vulindlela, which involves a team in the National Treasury and the President’s office.\nOperation Vulindlela is focusing on reforms in the electricity, water, telecommunications and transport sectors, as well as reforms to our visa and immigration regime.\nThe completion of digital migration is vital to our ability to effectively harness the enormous opportunities presented by technological change.\nAfter many delays, we will begin the phased switch-off of our analogue television transmitters from next month.\nIt is anticipated that this process, which will be done province-by-province, will be completed by the end of March 2022.\nThe process for the licensing of high-demand spectrum is at an advanced stage.\nWe hope that the ongoing litigation on the licensing matter will provide legal certainty and will not unduly delay the spectrum auction process.\nIn the water sector, we are working through Operation Vulindlela to ensure that water license applications are finalised within the revised timeframe of 90 days; and to revive the Green Drop and Blue Drop programmes to strengthen water quality monitoring.\nWe will finalise and implement the revised Raw Water Pricing Strategy, and accelerate the establishment of a national water resources infrastructure agency.\nOur ability to compete in global markets depends on the efficiency of our ports and rail network.\nWe are repositioning Durban as a hub port for the Southern Hemisphere and developing Ngqura as the container terminal of choice.\nThe rail corridor from Gauteng is being extended to enable the export of vehicles through Port Elizabeth.\nThese are crucial steps to move freight from road to rail and increase the competitiveness of the rail system.\nWork is underway with the relevant departments to reform our visa and immigration regime to attract skills and grow the tourism sector.\nAs international travel starts to recover in the wake of COVID-19, we will undertake a full rollout of eVisas to visitors from China, India, Nigeria, Kenya and 10 other countries.\nThe revised list of critical skills will be published for public comment by the Department of Home Affairs, within one week, to ensure that the final version reflects the skills needed by the economy.\nThe momentum that Operation Vulindlela has already built, and the support that it has received across government, shows that we are serious about reform.\nWe will continue to work relentlessly and without pause to create a more modern, efficient and competitive economy that is more open to all South Africans.\nTo support our reform process, the Presidential State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Council has outlined a clear set of reforms that will enable these vital public companies to fulfil their mandate for growth and development.\nOverarching legislation for state-owned companies will be tabled in Cabinet this financial year and in Parliament in the next the financial year.\nA centralised SOE model is being implemented this financial year, which will ensure a standardised governance, financial management and operational performance framework for all SOEs.\nThe mandates of all SOEs are being re-evaluated to ensure that they are responsive to the country’s needs and the implementation of the National Development Plan.\nIn the midst of the economic damage caused by COVID-19, South Africa’s agricultural sector has performed remarkably well.\nIn 2020, we became the world’s second-largest exporter of citrus, with strong export growth in wine, maize, nuts, deciduous fruit and sugar cane.\nThe favourable weather conditions in 2020 and the beginning of 2021 mean that agriculture is likely to grow in the near term.\nThis provides an opportunity for further public-private partnership in agriculture to promote transformation and ensure sustainable growth.\nIt is an opportunity to accelerate land redistribution through a variety of instruments such as land restitution and expropriation of land in order to boost agricultural output.\nTo date, government has redistributed over five million hectares (ha) of land, totalling around 5 500 farms, to more than 300 000 beneficiaries.\nThis is in addition to the land restitution process, which has benefited over two million land claimants and resulted in the transfer of around 2,7 million ha.\nWe are also pursuing programmes to assist smallholder and emerging farmers with market access, to develop skills across the entire agricultural value chain and increase the number of commercial black farmers.\nDuring the course of the next financial year, we will establish a land and agrarian reform agency to fast-track land reform.\nThe Public Service is at the coalface of government, and lack of professionalism does not just impact service delivery; it also dents public confidence.\nAdvancing honesty, ethics and integrity in the Public Service is critical if we are to build a capable state.\nThrough the National School of Government, we continue to roll out courses and training programmes for government officials from entry level to senior management and the Executive.\nIn October last year, I signed off on ministerial performance agreements with all Ministers, which have now been published online.\nThis will enhance accountability and focused performance by members of the Executive.\nWe remain on course to build a capable and professional civil service that delivers on its mandate and is accountable to the South African people.\nWe are proceeding with our efforts to strengthen the local government infrastructure and accelerate service delivery through the District Development Model.\nThe model brings all three spheres of government to focus on key priorities and implementation of critical high impact projects.\nWorking with both public and private sector partners, government is implementing a range of measures to support municipalities to address inadequate and inconsistent service delivery in areas such water provision, infrastructure build and maintenance.\nWe are focusing on the appointment of properly qualified officials at a local level to ensure effective management and provision of services.\nAs we prepare for local government elections, which are due take place this year, we will need to adjust to the conditions forced upon us by COVID-19 to ensure that the people of this country can determine who represents them at this crucial level of government.\nFellow South Africans,\nCorruption is one of the greatest impediments to the country’s growth and development.\nThe revelations from the Zondo Commission of Inquiry lay bare the extent of state capture and related corruption.\nTestimony at the commission has shown how the criminal justice system was compromised and weakened.\nIt is, therefore, vital that we sustain the momentum of the rebuilding effort that we began three years ago.\nThere has been great progress in turning around law enforcement bodies.\nCritical leadership positions have been filled with capable, experienced and trustworthy professionals.\nThere is improved cooperation and sharing of resources between the respective law enforcement agencies, enabling a more integrated approach to investigations and prosecutions.\nWe have started implementation of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy, which lays the basis for a comprehensive and integrated society-wide response to corruption.\nWe will shortly be appointing members of the National Anti-Corruption Advisory Council, which is a multi-sectoral body that will oversee the initial implementation of the strategy and the establishment of an independent statutory anti-corruption body that reports to Parliament.\nWhen reports started to surface last year about possible fraud and corruption in the procurement of COVID-19-related goods and services, we acted decisively to put a stop to these practices, to investigate all allegations and to act against those responsible.\nWe established a fusion centre, which brings together key law enforcement agencies to share information and resources.\nThe fusion centre has brought many cases to trial and preserved or recovered millions of rands in public funds.\nThe Special Investigating Unit (SIU) was authorised to investigate allegations of unlawful conduct with respect to COVID-19 procurement by all state bodies during the National State of Disaster.\nAs it reported last week, the SIU has finalised investigations into 164 contracts with a total value of R3,5 billion.\nIn a significant advance for transparency and accountability, the Political Party Funding Act, 2018 (Act 6 of 2018) will come into operation on 1 April this year.\nThis will regulate public and private funding of political parties. Among other things, it requires the disclosure of donations to parties and establishes two funds that will enable represented political parties to undertake their programmes.\nCrime and violence continue to undermine people’s sense of safety and security.\nTackling crime is central to the success of our recovery.\nCrimes like cable theft, railway infrastructure vandalism, land invasions, construction site disruptions and attacks on truck drivers hamper economic activity and discourage investment.\nWe have taken steps and will continue to stop these crimes and deal with those responsible in terms of the law.\nTask teams have been set up in a number of provinces to deal with extortion and violence on sites of economic activity.\nWe are also fast-tracking the implementation and capacitation of the Border Management Agency to curb illegal immigration and cross-border crime.\nEnding gender-based violence (GBV) is imperative if we lay claim to being a society rooted in equality and non-sexism.\nWhen I launched the National Strategic Plan on Gender-Based Violence and Femicide (GBVF) in April last year, I made a promise to the women and children of this country that we were going to strengthen the Criminal Justice System to prevent them being traumatised again, and to ensure that perpetrators face justice.\nTo give effect to this, three key pieces of legislation were introduced in Parliament last year to make the criminal justice system more effective in combatting GBV.\nTo ensure that perpetrators are brought to book, we are making progress in reducing the backlog of GBV cases.\nWe continue to provide care and support to survivors of GBV.\nIn the SoNA last year, I said that we would prioritise the economic empowerment of women.\nLast year, Cabinet approved a policy that 40% of public procurement should go to women-owned businesses and entities.\nSeveral departments have started implementing this policy and are making progress.\nLast week, we also launched a groundbreaking private sector-led GBVF Response Fund.\nSeveral South African companies and global philanthropies made pledges to the value of R128 million.\nOver the next three years, government will allocate approximately R12 billion to implement the various components of the National Strategic Plan.\nGBV will only end when everyone takes responsibility for doing so in their homes, in their communities, in their workplaces, in their places of worship and in their schools.\nEqually, we need to give attention to issues affecting children, including improving school-readiness, ECD planning and funding, protection against preventable diseases, policy reform around child welfare and reducing violence against children.\nIn the year ahead, we are also going to forge ahead with efforts to provide greater opportunities for persons with disabilities to participate in the economy and in society in general.\nAs we rebuild our economy in the midst of a pandemic, it is necessary that we continue – within our means – to provide support to those businesses and individuals that continue to be most affected.\nBusinesses in several sectors are still struggling and many families continue to suffer as the job market slowly recovers.\nOver the last few months, we have had ongoing discussions with our social partners in business, labour and community-based organisations, who proposed an extension of some of the social and economic support.\nWe have, therefore, decided to extend the period for the Special COVID-19 Grant of R350 by a further three months.\nThis has proven to be an effective and efficient short-term measure to reduce the immediate impact on the livelihoods of poor South Africans.\nWe have also decided to extend the COVID-19 TERS benefit until 15 March 2021, only for those sectors that have not been able to open and operate.\nThe conditions of this extension and the sectors to be included will be announced after consultations with social partners at the National Economic Development and Labour Council.\nThe National Treasury will work with its partners and stakeholders on improvements to the Loan Guarantee Scheme so that it better addresses the realities of SMMEs and other businesses as they strive to recover.\nWe will work with our social partners to ensure that these and other interventions provide the relief to those who most need it.\nFellow South Africans,\nJust as a harsh fire gives new life to our country’s fynbos, this crisis is an opportunity to build a different, better South Africa.\nRebuilding our country requires a common effort.\nIt requires that all South African take responsibility and play their part.\nLet us work together as government, as business, as labour, as political parties and as all of society to clear away the rubble and lay a new foundation.\nAbove all, let us return this country to the values upon which it was founded.\nOn the day of his release, 31 years ago, Madiba gave his first public address here in Cape Town, where he reminded South Africans that there were difficult days ahead, and that the battle was far from won.\nMadiba said:\n“Now is the time to intensify the Struggle on all fronts.”\n“To relax our efforts now would be a mistake which generations to come will not be able to forgive.”\nIn counting the great cost to our society over the past year, we may be tempted to lose faith.\nBut we can get through this. Because we are a nation of heroes.\nI am referring not to the glorious lineage of Struggle icons, but to the everyday heroes that walk among us, who work hard every day to put food on the table, to keep the company running, and to give support, help and care to our people.\nIt is your resilience that will help this country recover.\nIn addition to the many challenges that beset our people, we have heard that his Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini has not been well in recent days and is admitted to hospital.\nI wish to convey my wishes for the speedy recovery of His Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini ka Bhekuzulu.\nOur thoughts and prayers are with the Royal Household and the Zulu nation at this time.\nIt is our collective wish that Isilo Samabandla Wonke is soon restored to good health.\nAs we prepare for the difficult path ahead, we can draw strength From Maya Angelou’s great poem, Still I rise.\nShe writes:\nOut of the huts of history’s shame\nI rise\nUp from a past that’s rooted in pain\nI rise\nI’m a black ocean, leaping and wide,\nWelling and swelling I bear in the tide.\nLeaving behind nights of terror and fear\nI rise\nInto a daybreak that’s wondrously clear\nI rise\nBringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,\nI am the dream and the hope of the slave.\nI rise I rise I rise.\nPeople of South Africa, it is your country that calls on you to rise.\nLet us march forward together to equality, to growth, to dignity and to recovery.\nMay God bless South Africa and protect her sons and daughters.\nI thank you."}, {"claim": "There were 1.7 million fewer people employed in South Africa in the third quarter of 2020 than there were in the first quarter.", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Supported", "justification": "The answers and credible sources show that there were just under 1.7 million fewer people employed so the claim is supported.", "claim_date": "11-2-2021", "speaker": "Cyril Ramaphosa ", "original_claim_url": "https://www.gov.za/speeches/president-cyril-ramaphosa-2021-state-nation-address-11-feb-2021-0000", "fact_checking_article": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210316155254/https://africacheck.org/fact-checks/reports/chickens-and-economy-fact-checking-ramaphosas-sona2021", "reporting_source": "speech", "location_ISO_code": "ZA", "claim_types": ["Numerical Claim"], "fact_checking_strategies": ["Written Evidence", "Numerical Comparison"], "questions": [{"question": "How many people were employed in the first quarter of 2020, in South Africa?", "answers": [{"answer": "in the first quarter of 2020, when news of Covid-19 was just reaching South Africa, there were 16,383,000 employed people between the ages of 15 and 64.", "answer_type": "Abstractive", "source_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210403083909/http://www.statssa.gov.za/publications/P0211/P02111stQuarter2020.pdf#page=6", "source_medium": "PDF"}]}, {"question": "How many people were employed in the third quarter of 2020, in South Africa?", "answers": [{"answer": "By the third quarter of 2020, that figure had dropped to 14,691,000.

It is wondrous in its diversity.\nOur national flower, the Protea, is a species of fynbos.\nWhen I opened the third National Investment Conference last year, I spoke of the Protea's unique properties that in so many ways resemble our national character.\nWhat is most unique and special about fynbos is that to be sustainable and survive, it needs fire.\nAt least once every twenty years, fynbos must burn at extremely high temperatures to allow the ecosystem to be rejuvenated and grow afresh.\nThroughout the summer, the burned foliage lies desolate. But when the autumn rains return, the seeds germinate, and its life cycle begins all over again.\nThe mountains bloom with new life as plants which once seemed lost grow back even stronger than before.\nWe, the people of South Africa, have over the past year experienced a terrible hardship.\nLike a wildfire that sweeps across the mountainous ranges where the fynbos grows, a deadly pandemic has swept across the world, leaving devastation in its path.\nAnd yet, like the hardy fynbos of our native land, we too have proven to be resilient in many ways.\nFor three centuries, we were victims of oppression, dispossession and injustice.\nAnd for three centuries, we resisted.\nThe flames of injustice may have scarred us, but they did not consume us.\nThe rains of democracy brought rejuvenation and the birth of a new nation.\nWe have risen time and time again from the depths of darkness to herald a new day.\nAs we look on the grave damage that this disease has caused, we know that like the fynbos, like all those who have walked this land before us, we will rise again.\nNearly a year has passed since South Africa saw its first case of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19.\nSince then, nearly one-and-a-half million people in our country are known to have been infected by the virus.\nMore than 45 000 people are known to have died.\nBeyond these statistics lies a human story of tragedy and pain.\nThere is no family, no community and no place of work that has not lost someone they knew, worked with and loved.\nIt is also a story of courage and resilience.\nThe resilience of the hospital worker who – day after day, night after night – goes to work to save lives, knowing that they, themselves, are at risk of infection.\nIt is a wonderful account of the courage of the police officer, the soldier, the essential worker, the carer and all those on the frontline, who have kept our country safe, our people fed and our economy going.\nIt is a story of solidarity and compassion.\nOf a nation that has stood together to confront COVID-19 in ways not seen since the early days of our democracy.\nMore than anything else, this crisis has revealed the true character of our remarkable nation.\nIt has revealed a spirit of the people who refused to be defeated.\nIt is this South African spirit that must drive our resolve to build a new and more equal economy and a better, more just society.\nThe year ahead must be a time for change, for progress and for rebirth.\nIt must be a year in which we rise.\nThis is no ordinary year, and this is no ordinary SoNA.\nI will therefore, focus this evening on the foremost, overriding priorities of 2021.\nFirst, we must defeat the coronavirus pandemic.\nSecond, we must accelerate our economic recovery.\nThird, we must implement economic reforms to create sustainable jobs and drive inclusive growth.\nAnd finally, we must fight corruption and strengthen the State.\nIn the coming weeks, we will address the other important elements of government’s programme for the year.\nFundamental to our nation’s recovery is an unrelenting and comprehensive response to overcome the coronavirus.\nSouth Africa has just emerged from the second wave of infections since COVID-19 arrived on our shores in March last year.\nDriven by a new variant of the virus, this second wave was more severe and cost many more lives than the first wave.\nNevertheless, the human cost could have been far greater.\nHad we not moved quickly to restrict movement and activity, had we not prepared our health facilities, had South Africans not observed the basic health protocols, the devastation caused by this virus could have been far worse.\nThis year, we must do everything in our means to contain and overcome this pandemic.\nThis means intensifying our prevention efforts and strengthening our health system.\nIt also means that we must undertake a massive vaccination programme to save lives and dramatically reduce infections across the population.\nEarlier this week, we were informed that one of the vaccines that we had procured, the AstraZeneca vaccine, offers minimal protection from mild to moderate infection by the new variant known as 501Y.v2.\nThis is according to early findings of a study by our scientists and researchers.\nWe applaud these scientists for leading this research and providing new evidence that is vital for guiding our response.\nSince this variant is now the dominant variant in our country, these findings have significant implications for the pace, design and sequencing of our vaccine programme.\nWhile it should not delay the start of the vaccination programme by much, it will affect the choice of vaccines and the manner of their deployment.\nThe first phase of our vaccination programme, which is targeted at health and other frontline workers, will now use the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which has been shown to be effective against the 501Y.V2 variant.\nWe have secured nine million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\nThe first batch, of 80 000 doses, will arrive in the country next week.\nFurther consignments will arrive over the next four weeks, totalling 500 000 Johnson & Johnson vaccines.\nAll provinces have rollout plans in place as the first vaccines come through.\nI wish to thank all provinces for their level of preparedness for this massive undertaking that we are about to embark upon.\nIn addition, we have secured 12 million vaccine doses from the global COVAX facility.\nThis will be complemented by other vaccines that are available to South Africa through the African Union’s (AU) African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team Facility.\nPfizer has committed 20 million vaccine doses, commencing with deliveries at the end of the first quarter.\nWe are continuing our engagements with all the vaccine manufacturers to ensure that we secure sufficient quantities of vaccines that are suitable to our conditions.\nThe health and safety of our people remains our paramount concern.\nAll medication imported into the country is monitored, evaluated, investigated, inspected and registered by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority.\nWe will continue to use the science-driven approach that has served us well since the earliest days of the pandemic.\nThe success of the vaccination programme will rely on active collaboration between all sectors of society.\nWe are greatly encouraged by the active involvement of business, labour, the health industry and medical schemes, in particular, in preparing for this mass vaccination drive.\nAs we have overcome before, we will overcome again and rise.\nBut it is not just this disease that we must defeat.\nWe must overcome poverty, hunger, joblessness and inequality.\nWe must overcome a legacy of exclusion and dispossession that continues to impoverish our people, and which this pandemic has severely worsened.\nWhen I delivered the SoNA in this House last year, none of us could have imagined how – within a matter of weeks – our country and our world would have changed so dramatically.\nOur plans had to be adapted in response to a global emergency.\nBudgets had to be reprioritised and many programmes had to be deferred.\nOver the past year, South Africa has experienced a sharp decline in growth and a significant increase in unemployment.\nPoverty is on the rise. Inequality is deepening.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, our economy was 6% smaller than it was in the last quarter of 2019.\nThere were 1,7 million fewer people employed in the third quarter of 2020 than there were in the first quarter, before the pandemic struck.\nOur unemployment rate now stands at a staggering 30,8%.\nAs a result of the relief measures that we implemented and the phased reopening of the economy, we expect to see a strong recovery in employment by the end of the year.\nAs we worked to contain the spread of the virus, we also had to take extraordinary measures to support ordinary South Africans, assist businesses in distress and protect people’s livelihoods.\nThe Social and Economic Relief Package that we introduced in April last year is the largest intervention of its kind in our history.\nIt identified measures worth a total of R500 billion – or about 10% of our gross domestic product – to provide cash directly to the poorest households, to provide wage support to workers and to provide various forms of relief to struggling businesses.\nA total of 18 million people, or close to one-third of the population, received additional grant payments through these relief measures.\nIt is estimated that this grant lifted more than five million people above the food poverty line, helping to alleviate hunger in a moment of great crisis.\nTo date, more than R57 billion in wage support has been paid to over 4,5 million workers through the special Unemployment Insurance Fund Temporary Employer-Employee Relief Scheme (TERS).\nMore than R1,3 billion has been provided in support mainly for small- and medium-sized businesses.\nIn addition, over R70 billion in tax relief was extended to businesses in distress.\nAround R18,9 billion in loans have been approved for 13 000 businesses through the Loan Guarantee Scheme.\nFellow South Africans,\nIt is nearly four months since I stood here before a joint sitting of this Parliament to present to the nation the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan.\nThis evening, we stand here not to make promises but to report on progress in the implementation of the recovery plan and the priority actions we must take to restore growth and create jobs.\nSince the launch of the plan, we have focused on four priority interventions:\n- a massive rollout of infrastructure throughout the country,\n- a massive increase in local production,\n- an employment stimulus to create jobs and support livelihoods, and\n- the rapid expansion of our energy generation capacity.\nWe announced that we would be embarking on a massive rollout of infrastructure throughout the country.\nWe knew that to achieve this objective we would need to steadily rebuild technical skills within government to prepare and manage large infrastructure projects.\nWe have now developed an infrastructure investment project pipeline worth R340 billion in network industries such as energy, water, transport and telecommunications.\nConstruction has started and progress is being made on a number of these projects.\nSince the announcement of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, we have launched two major human settlements projects that will provide homes to almost 68 000 households in the Gauteng province.\nSimilar human settlements projects are planned in other provinces.\nTwo years ago, I spoke about the dream of building new cities that will enable us to make a break with apartheid’s spatial development.\nNew post-apartheid cities are being conceptualised in a number of places in our country.\nThe Lanseria Smart City, the first new city to be built in a democratic South Africa, is now a reality in the making.\nThe draft masterplan for this smart city – which will become home to between 350 000 to 500 000 people within the next decade – was completed in November 2020 and is now out for public comment.\nProgress is being made on several major water infrastructure projects.\nThese include Phase 2A of the Mokolo and Crocodile River Project, and the uMkhomazi Water Project.\nThe Infrastructure Investment Plan identifies roads projects worth R19 billion covering the spine of the South African road network.\nWork is underway to finalise finance structuring for these projects.\nResources have been committed from the fiscus to support the construction and rehabilitation of the major N1, N2 and N3 highways.\nThese infrastructure projects will lead to the revival of the construction industry and the creation of much-needed jobs.\nThe R100 billion Infrastructure Fund is now in full operation.\nThis fund will blend resources from the fiscus with financing from the private sector and development institutions.\nIts approved project pipeline for 2021 is varied and includes the Student Housing Infrastructure Programme, which aims to provide 300 000 student beds.\nAnother approved project is SA Connect, a programme to roll out broadband to schools, hospitals, police stations and other government facilities.\nThe second priority intervention of the recovery plan is to support a massive increase in local production and to make South African exports globally competitive.\nThis will encourage greater investment by the private sector in productive activity.\nKey to this plan is a renewed commitment from government, business and organised labour to buy local.\nThis commitment should lead to increased local production, which will lead to the revival of our manufacturing industry.\nAll social partners that participated in the development of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, as part of our social compact, have agreed to work together to reduce our reliance on imports by 20% over the next five years.\nThey have identified 42 products – ranging from edible oils to furniture, fruit concentrates, personal protective equipment, steel products and green economy inputs – that can be sourced locally.\nIf we achieve our target, we will significantly expand our productive economy, potentially returning more than R200 billion to the country’s annual output.\nLast year, we undertook to create a larger market for small businesses and designate 1 000 locally produced products that must be procured from Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs).\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic forced the closure of global value chains, we have been able to speed up this initiative as the local supply chains became open for locally manufactured products.\nTo this end, Cabinet approved the SMME-Focused Localisation Policy Framework which identified the 1 000 products.\nFurthermore, the departments of Small Business Development and Trade, Industry and Competition are supporting SMMEs to access larger domestic and international markets.\nThese efforts are supported by robust manufacturing support programmes.\nIn the SoNA last year, I said that our vision for industrialisation is underpinned by sector master plans to rejuvenate and grow key industries.\nFour master plans that have been completed and signed to date – which are part of the social compact between labour, business, government and communities – have already had an impact in their respective industries.\nThrough the implementation of the Poultry Master Plan, the industry has invested R800 million to upgrade production.\nSouth Africa now produces an additional one million chickens every week.\nThe Sugar Master Plan was signed during the lockdown, with a commitment from large users of sugar to procure at least 80% of their sugar needs from local growers.\nThrough the implementation of the plan, last year saw a rise in local production and a decline in imported sugar, creating stability for an industry which employs some 85 000 workers.\nSupport for black small-scale farmers is being stepped up, with a large beverage producer committing to expand their procurement sharply.\nSince the signing of the Clothing, Textile, Footwear and Leather Masterplan in November 2019, the industry has invested more than half a billion rand to expand local manufacturing facilities, including SMMEs.\nWe have worked closely with the auto sector to help it weather the pandemic.\nBy the end of the year, the sector had recovered around 70% of its normal annual production, in difficult circumstances.\nLast week, the Ford Motor Company announced a R16 billion investment to expand their manufacturing facility in Tshwane for the next generation Ford Ranger bakkie.\nThis investment will support the growth of around 12 small and medium enterprises in automotive component manufacturing.\nNearly half of the procurement spend on construction of the bulk earthworks and top structure at the Tshwane Special Economic Zone during this phase is expected to be allocated for SMMEs, an amount equal to R1,7 billion in procurement opportunities.\nToyota has invested in its KwaZulu-Natal facility to start production of the first generation of hybrid electric vehicles to come off a South African assembly line.\nThis follows investment announcements by Nissan, Mercedes Benz and Isuzu in expanded production facilities, all of which cement South Africa’s position as a global player in auto manufacturing.\nThis year, our focus will be on getting the industry back to full production, implementing the Black Industrialist Fund and working on a new platform for expanded auto trade with the rest of the continent.\nThis will be part of our concerted effort to boost the manufacturing sector.\nThis year, we will begin to harness the opportunities presented by the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which came into operation on 1 January, following the adoption of the Johannesburg Declaration by the AU.\nThe AfCFTA provides a platform for South African businesses to expand into markets across the continent, and for South Africa to position itself as a gateway to the continent.\nTo address the deep inequalities in our society, we must accelerate the implementation of broad-based black economic empowerment policies on ownership, control and management of the economy.\nLast year, government agreed to landmark deals with companies that will advance black economic empowerment by transferring ownership to their workers.\nIn November last year, we held our third South Africa Investment Conference to review the implementation of previous commitments and to generate new investment into our economy.\nEven under difficult economic circumstances, the investment conference managed to raise some R108 billion in additional investment commitments.\nTogether with investment confirmed from the two previous conferences, we have now received R773 billion in investment commitments towards our five-year target of R1,2 trillion.\nFirms have reported that some R183 billion of these investments has already flowed into projects that benefit the South African economy.\nThis shows that our country is still an attractive investment destination for both local and offshore companies.\nWe have worked to facilitate investment by increasing the ease of doing business, including making it easier to start a business.\nIn the past year, more than 125 000 new companies were registered through the BizPortal platform, completing their registration in just a matter of hours from the comfort of their homes or offices.\nWe are making it easier for business to do business.\nOur third priority intervention is an employment stimulus to create jobs and support livelihoods.\nThe largest numbers of jobs will be created by the private sector in a number of industries as the economy recovers.\nWe continue to work in a social compact with the private sector to create a more conducive environment for them to be able to create jobs.\nOur compact with the private sector is underpinned by a clear commitment to grow our economy and to create jobs.\nHowever, the public sector has a responsibility to stimulate job creation; both through its policies and through direct job creation opportunities.\nThe Presidential Employment Stimulus is one of the most significant expansions of public and social employment in South Africa’s history.\nBy the end of January 2021, over 430 000 opportunities were already supported through the stimulus.\nA further 180 000 opportunities are currently in the recruitment process.\nThese opportunities are in areas like education, arts and culture, global business services, early childhood development (ECD), and small-scale and subsistence farming.\nIt involves environmental programmes such as the clearing of alien trees, wetland rehabilitation, fire prevention, and cleaning and greening across all municipalities.\nThese programmes are about real lives and real livelihoods.\nNearly half a million people are now receiving an income, developing new skills and contributing to their community and the country’s economy.\nWe will continue to support employment for as long as it is necessary while the labour market recovers, even as we work to promote stronger and more resilient growth in the private sector.\nIn the SoNA last year, in response to the huge challenge our country faces of youth unemployment, I announced that the National Youth Development Agency and the Department of Small Business Development would provide grant funding and business support to 1 000 young entrepreneurs within 100 days.\nWhile the programme had to be put on hold due to the coronavirus restrictions, it nevertheless managed to reach its target of 1 000 businesses by International Youth Day on 12 August 2020.\nThis provides a firm foundation for our efforts to support 15 000 start-ups by 2024.\nLast year, we said we would establish the National Pathway Management Network to provide support and opportunities to young people across the country.\nI want to encourage every young South African to join the more than 1,2 million people who are already in the network, and take their next steps to a better future.\nOf the many hardships our people had to experience last year, schooling disruption placed a huge burden on learners, teachers and families.\nDespite this, they persevered.\nIt is our priority for this year to regain lost time and improve educational outcomes, from the early years through to high school and post-school education and training.\nThe fourth priority intervention of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan is to rapidly expand energy generation capacity.\nRestoring Eskom to operational and financial health and accelerating its restructuring process is central to this objective.\nEskom has been restructured into three separate entities for generation, transmission and distribution.\nThis will lay the foundations for an efficient, modern and competitive energy system.\nEskom is making substantial progress with its intensive maintenance and operational excellence programmes to improve the reliability of its coal fleet.\nWe are working closely with Eskom on proposals to improve its financial position, manage its debt and reduce its dependence on the fiscus.\nThis requires a review of the tariff path to ensure that it reflects all reasonable costs and measures to resolve the problem of municipal debt.\nIn December 2020, government and its social partners signed the historic Eskom Social Compact, which outlines the necessary actions we must take, collectively and as individual constituencies, to meet the country’s energy needs now and into the future.\nOver the last year, we have taken action to urgently and substantially increase generation capacity in addition to what Eskom generates:\n- The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy will soon be announcing the successful bids for 2 000 megawatts (MW) of emergency power.\n- The necessary regulations have been amended and the requirements clarified for municipalities to buy power from independent power producers. Systems are being put in place to support qualifying municipalities.\n- Government will soon be initiating the procurement of an additional 11 800 MW of power from renewable energy, natural gas, battery storage and coal in line with the Integrated Resource Plan 2019.\nDespite this work, Eskom estimates that, without additional capacity, there will be an electricity supply shortfall of between 4 000 and 6 000 MW over the next five years, as old coal-fired power stations reach their end of life.\nAs part of the measures to address this shortfall, we will in the coming weeks issue a request for proposals for 2 600 MW from wind and solar energy as part of Bid Window 5.\nThis will be followed by another bid window in August 2021.\nRecent analysis suggests that easing the licensing requirements for new embedded generation projects could unlock up to 5 000 MW of additional capacity and help to ease the impact of load shedding.\nWe will therefore amend Schedule 2 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 2006 (Act 4 of 2006) within the next three months to increase the licensing threshold for embedded generation.\nThis will include consultation among key stakeholders on the level at which the new threshold should be set and the finalisation of the necessary enabling frameworks.\nEskom has already started work to expedite its commercial and technical processes to allow this additional capacity onto the grid without undue delay.\nAs we mobilise all of the resources at our disposal to support economic recovery, we cannot lose sight of the threat that climate change poses to our environmental health, socioeconomic development and economic growth.\nWe are, therefore, working to fulfil our commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement which include the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\nEskom, our largest greenhouse gas emitter, has committed in principle to net zero emission by 2050 and to increase its renewable capacity.\nEskom will be looking to partner with investors to repurpose and repower part of its coal fleet.\nThis will be done in a way that stimulates investment, local economic activity and local manufacturing, as part of a just transition.\nOur work on climate change will be guided by the Presidential Coordinating Commission on Climate Change, which is meeting for the first time this month.\nThe commission will work on a plan for a just transition to a low-carbon economy and climate resilient society.\nWe will not achieve higher rates of growth and employment if we do not implement structural economic reforms.\nThese reforms are necessary to reduce costs and barriers to entry, increase competition, stimulate new investment and create space for new entrants in the market.\nThis work is being driven through Operation Vulindlela, which involves a team in the National Treasury and the President’s office.\nOperation Vulindlela is focusing on reforms in the electricity, water, telecommunications and transport sectors, as well as reforms to our visa and immigration regime.\nThe completion of digital migration is vital to our ability to effectively harness the enormous opportunities presented by technological change.\nAfter many delays, we will begin the phased switch-off of our analogue television transmitters from next month.\nIt is anticipated that this process, which will be done province-by-province, will be completed by the end of March 2022.\nThe process for the licensing of high-demand spectrum is at an advanced stage.\nWe hope that the ongoing litigation on the licensing matter will provide legal certainty and will not unduly delay the spectrum auction process.\nIn the water sector, we are working through Operation Vulindlela to ensure that water license applications are finalised within the revised timeframe of 90 days; and to revive the Green Drop and Blue Drop programmes to strengthen water quality monitoring.\nWe will finalise and implement the revised Raw Water Pricing Strategy, and accelerate the establishment of a national water resources infrastructure agency.\nOur ability to compete in global markets depends on the efficiency of our ports and rail network.\nWe are repositioning Durban as a hub port for the Southern Hemisphere and developing Ngqura as the container terminal of choice.\nThe rail corridor from Gauteng is being extended to enable the export of vehicles through Port Elizabeth.\nThese are crucial steps to move freight from road to rail and increase the competitiveness of the rail system.\nWork is underway with the relevant departments to reform our visa and immigration regime to attract skills and grow the tourism sector.\nAs international travel starts to recover in the wake of COVID-19, we will undertake a full rollout of eVisas to visitors from China, India, Nigeria, Kenya and 10 other countries.\nThe revised list of critical skills will be published for public comment by the Department of Home Affairs, within one week, to ensure that the final version reflects the skills needed by the economy.\nThe momentum that Operation Vulindlela has already built, and the support that it has received across government, shows that we are serious about reform.\nWe will continue to work relentlessly and without pause to create a more modern, efficient and competitive economy that is more open to all South Africans.\nTo support our reform process, the Presidential State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Council has outlined a clear set of reforms that will enable these vital public companies to fulfil their mandate for growth and development.\nOverarching legislation for state-owned companies will be tabled in Cabinet this financial year and in Parliament in the next the financial year.\nA centralised SOE model is being implemented this financial year, which will ensure a standardised governance, financial management and operational performance framework for all SOEs.\nThe mandates of all SOEs are being re-evaluated to ensure that they are responsive to the country’s needs and the implementation of the National Development Plan.\nIn the midst of the economic damage caused by COVID-19, South Africa’s agricultural sector has performed remarkably well.\nIn 2020, we became the world’s second-largest exporter of citrus, with strong export growth in wine, maize, nuts, deciduous fruit and sugar cane.\nThe favourable weather conditions in 2020 and the beginning of 2021 mean that agriculture is likely to grow in the near term.\nThis provides an opportunity for further public-private partnership in agriculture to promote transformation and ensure sustainable growth.\nIt is an opportunity to accelerate land redistribution through a variety of instruments such as land restitution and expropriation of land in order to boost agricultural output.\nTo date, government has redistributed over five million hectares (ha) of land, totalling around 5 500 farms, to more than 300 000 beneficiaries.\nThis is in addition to the land restitution process, which has benefited over two million land claimants and resulted in the transfer of around 2,7 million ha.\nWe are also pursuing programmes to assist smallholder and emerging farmers with market access, to develop skills across the entire agricultural value chain and increase the number of commercial black farmers.\nDuring the course of the next financial year, we will establish a land and agrarian reform agency to fast-track land reform.\nThe Public Service is at the coalface of government, and lack of professionalism does not just impact service delivery; it also dents public confidence.\nAdvancing honesty, ethics and integrity in the Public Service is critical if we are to build a capable state.\nThrough the National School of Government, we continue to roll out courses and training programmes for government officials from entry level to senior management and the Executive.\nIn October last year, I signed off on ministerial performance agreements with all Ministers, which have now been published online.\nThis will enhance accountability and focused performance by members of the Executive.\nWe remain on course to build a capable and professional civil service that delivers on its mandate and is accountable to the South African people.\nWe are proceeding with our efforts to strengthen the local government infrastructure and accelerate service delivery through the District Development Model.\nThe model brings all three spheres of government to focus on key priorities and implementation of critical high impact projects.\nWorking with both public and private sector partners, government is implementing a range of measures to support municipalities to address inadequate and inconsistent service delivery in areas such water provision, infrastructure build and maintenance.\nWe are focusing on the appointment of properly qualified officials at a local level to ensure effective management and provision of services.\nAs we prepare for local government elections, which are due take place this year, we will need to adjust to the conditions forced upon us by COVID-19 to ensure that the people of this country can determine who represents them at this crucial level of government.\nFellow South Africans,\nCorruption is one of the greatest impediments to the country’s growth and development.\nThe revelations from the Zondo Commission of Inquiry lay bare the extent of state capture and related corruption.\nTestimony at the commission has shown how the criminal justice system was compromised and weakened.\nIt is, therefore, vital that we sustain the momentum of the rebuilding effort that we began three years ago.\nThere has been great progress in turning around law enforcement bodies.\nCritical leadership positions have been filled with capable, experienced and trustworthy professionals.\nThere is improved cooperation and sharing of resources between the respective law enforcement agencies, enabling a more integrated approach to investigations and prosecutions.\nWe have started implementation of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy, which lays the basis for a comprehensive and integrated society-wide response to corruption.\nWe will shortly be appointing members of the National Anti-Corruption Advisory Council, which is a multi-sectoral body that will oversee the initial implementation of the strategy and the establishment of an independent statutory anti-corruption body that reports to Parliament.\nWhen reports started to surface last year about possible fraud and corruption in the procurement of COVID-19-related goods and services, we acted decisively to put a stop to these practices, to investigate all allegations and to act against those responsible.\nWe established a fusion centre, which brings together key law enforcement agencies to share information and resources.\nThe fusion centre has brought many cases to trial and preserved or recovered millions of rands in public funds.\nThe Special Investigating Unit (SIU) was authorised to investigate allegations of unlawful conduct with respect to COVID-19 procurement by all state bodies during the National State of Disaster.\nAs it reported last week, the SIU has finalised investigations into 164 contracts with a total value of R3,5 billion.\nIn a significant advance for transparency and accountability, the Political Party Funding Act, 2018 (Act 6 of 2018) will come into operation on 1 April this year.\nThis will regulate public and private funding of political parties. Among other things, it requires the disclosure of donations to parties and establishes two funds that will enable represented political parties to undertake their programmes.\nCrime and violence continue to undermine people’s sense of safety and security.\nTackling crime is central to the success of our recovery.\nCrimes like cable theft, railway infrastructure vandalism, land invasions, construction site disruptions and attacks on truck drivers hamper economic activity and discourage investment.\nWe have taken steps and will continue to stop these crimes and deal with those responsible in terms of the law.\nTask teams have been set up in a number of provinces to deal with extortion and violence on sites of economic activity.\nWe are also fast-tracking the implementation and capacitation of the Border Management Agency to curb illegal immigration and cross-border crime.\nEnding gender-based violence (GBV) is imperative if we lay claim to being a society rooted in equality and non-sexism.\nWhen I launched the National Strategic Plan on Gender-Based Violence and Femicide (GBVF) in April last year, I made a promise to the women and children of this country that we were going to strengthen the Criminal Justice System to prevent them being traumatised again, and to ensure that perpetrators face justice.\nTo give effect to this, three key pieces of legislation were introduced in Parliament last year to make the criminal justice system more effective in combatting GBV.\nTo ensure that perpetrators are brought to book, we are making progress in reducing the backlog of GBV cases.\nWe continue to provide care and support to survivors of GBV.\nIn the SoNA last year, I said that we would prioritise the economic empowerment of women.\nLast year, Cabinet approved a policy that 40% of public procurement should go to women-owned businesses and entities.\nSeveral departments have started implementing this policy and are making progress.\nLast week, we also launched a groundbreaking private sector-led GBVF Response Fund.\nSeveral South African companies and global philanthropies made pledges to the value of R128 million.\nOver the next three years, government will allocate approximately R12 billion to implement the various components of the National Strategic Plan.\nGBV will only end when everyone takes responsibility for doing so in their homes, in their communities, in their workplaces, in their places of worship and in their schools.\nEqually, we need to give attention to issues affecting children, including improving school-readiness, ECD planning and funding, protection against preventable diseases, policy reform around child welfare and reducing violence against children.\nIn the year ahead, we are also going to forge ahead with efforts to provide greater opportunities for persons with disabilities to participate in the economy and in society in general.\nAs we rebuild our economy in the midst of a pandemic, it is necessary that we continue – within our means – to provide support to those businesses and individuals that continue to be most affected.\nBusinesses in several sectors are still struggling and many families continue to suffer as the job market slowly recovers.\nOver the last few months, we have had ongoing discussions with our social partners in business, labour and community-based organisations, who proposed an extension of some of the social and economic support.\nWe have, therefore, decided to extend the period for the Special COVID-19 Grant of R350 by a further three months.\nThis has proven to be an effective and efficient short-term measure to reduce the immediate impact on the livelihoods of poor South Africans.\nWe have also decided to extend the COVID-19 TERS benefit until 15 March 2021, only for those sectors that have not been able to open and operate.\nThe conditions of this extension and the sectors to be included will be announced after consultations with social partners at the National Economic Development and Labour Council.\nThe National Treasury will work with its partners and stakeholders on improvements to the Loan Guarantee Scheme so that it better addresses the realities of SMMEs and other businesses as they strive to recover.\nWe will work with our social partners to ensure that these and other interventions provide the relief to those who most need it.\nFellow South Africans,\nJust as a harsh fire gives new life to our country’s fynbos, this crisis is an opportunity to build a different, better South Africa.\nRebuilding our country requires a common effort.\nIt requires that all South African take responsibility and play their part.\nLet us work together as government, as business, as labour, as political parties and as all of society to clear away the rubble and lay a new foundation.\nAbove all, let us return this country to the values upon which it was founded.\nOn the day of his release, 31 years ago, Madiba gave his first public address here in Cape Town, where he reminded South Africans that there were difficult days ahead, and that the battle was far from won.\nMadiba said:\n“Now is the time to intensify the Struggle on all fronts.”\n“To relax our efforts now would be a mistake which generations to come will not be able to forgive.”\nIn counting the great cost to our society over the past year, we may be tempted to lose faith.\nBut we can get through this. Because we are a nation of heroes.\nI am referring not to the glorious lineage of Struggle icons, but to the everyday heroes that walk among us, who work hard every day to put food on the table, to keep the company running, and to give support, help and care to our people.\nIt is your resilience that will help this country recover.\nIn addition to the many challenges that beset our people, we have heard that his Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini has not been well in recent days and is admitted to hospital.\nI wish to convey my wishes for the speedy recovery of His Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini ka Bhekuzulu.\nOur thoughts and prayers are with the Royal Household and the Zulu nation at this time.\nIt is our collective wish that Isilo Samabandla Wonke is soon restored to good health.\nAs we prepare for the difficult path ahead, we can draw strength From Maya Angelou’s great poem, Still I rise.\nShe writes:\nOut of the huts of history’s shame\nI rise\nUp from a past that’s rooted in pain\nI rise\nI’m a black ocean, leaping and wide,\nWelling and swelling I bear in the tide.\nLeaving behind nights of terror and fear\nI rise\nInto a daybreak that’s wondrously clear\nI rise\nBringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,\nI am the dream and the hope of the slave.\nI rise I rise I rise.\nPeople of South Africa, it is your country that calls on you to rise.\nLet us march forward together to equality, to growth, to dignity and to recovery.\nMay God bless South Africa and protect her sons and daughters.\nI thank you."}, {"claim": "South Africa’s national power utility,

Mabuza,\nFormer President Thabo Mbeki and Mrs Mbeki,\nFormer Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka,\nFormer Deputy President Baleka Mbete,\nChief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng and esteemed members of the Judiciary,\nMinisters and Deputy Ministers,\nHonourable members of the NA,\nHonourable members of the NCOP,\nDean of the European Region, representing the diplomatic corps, His Excellency, Mr Beka Dvali,\nDistinguished guests,\nFellow South Africans,\nOn this day, 31 years ago, President Nelson Mandela walked out of the gates of Victor Verster Prison a free person, a living embodiment of the resilience and courage of the South African people.\nFor nearly 40 million years, an extraordinary ecosystem has existed here at the southernmost tip of our continent.\nThe Fynbos Biome, which stretches across the Cape, has among the most distinctive features of any plants found on earth.\nIt can adapt to dry, hot summers and cold rainy winters. It is wondrous in its diversity.\nOur national flower, the Protea, is a species of fynbos.\nWhen I opened the third National Investment Conference last year, I spoke of the Protea's unique properties that in so many ways resemble our national character.\nWhat is most unique and special about fynbos is that to be sustainable and survive, it needs fire.\nAt least once every twenty years, fynbos must burn at extremely high temperatures to allow the ecosystem to be rejuvenated and grow afresh.\nThroughout the summer, the burned foliage lies desolate. But when the autumn rains return, the seeds germinate, and its life cycle begins all over again.\nThe mountains bloom with new life as plants which once seemed lost grow back even stronger than before.\nWe, the people of South Africa, have over the past year experienced a terrible hardship.\nLike a wildfire that sweeps across the mountainous ranges where the fynbos grows, a deadly pandemic has swept across the world, leaving devastation in its path.\nAnd yet, like the hardy fynbos of our native land, we too have proven to be resilient in many ways.\nFor three centuries, we were victims of oppression, dispossession and injustice.\nAnd for three centuries, we resisted.\nThe flames of injustice may have scarred us, but they did not consume us.\nThe rains of democracy brought rejuvenation and the birth of a new nation.\nWe have risen time and time again from the depths of darkness to herald a new day.\nAs we look on the grave damage that this disease has caused, we know that like the fynbos, like all those who have walked this land before us, we will rise again.\nNearly a year has passed since South Africa saw its first case of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19.\nSince then, nearly one-and-a-half million people in our country are known to have been infected by the virus.\nMore than 45 000 people are known to have died.\nBeyond these statistics lies a human story of tragedy and pain.\nThere is no family, no community and no place of work that has not lost someone they knew, worked with and loved.\nIt is also a story of courage and resilience.\nThe resilience of the hospital worker who – day after day, night after night – goes to work to save lives, knowing that they, themselves, are at risk of infection.\nIt is a wonderful account of the courage of the police officer, the soldier, the essential worker, the carer and all those on the frontline, who have kept our country safe, our people fed and our economy going.\nIt is a story of solidarity and compassion.\nOf a nation that has stood together to confront COVID-19 in ways not seen since the early days of our democracy.\nMore than anything else, this crisis has revealed the true character of our remarkable nation.\nIt has revealed a spirit of the people who refused to be defeated.\nIt is this South African spirit that must drive our resolve to build a new and more equal economy and a better, more just society.\nThe year ahead must be a time for change, for progress and for rebirth.\nIt must be a year in which we rise.\nThis is no ordinary year, and this is no ordinary SoNA.\nI will therefore, focus this evening on the foremost, overriding priorities of 2021.\nFirst, we must defeat the coronavirus pandemic.\nSecond, we must accelerate our economic recovery.\nThird, we must implement economic reforms to create sustainable jobs and drive inclusive growth.\nAnd finally, we must fight corruption and strengthen the State.\nIn the coming weeks, we will address the other important elements of government’s programme for the year.\nFundamental to our nation’s recovery is an unrelenting and comprehensive response to overcome the coronavirus.\nSouth Africa has just emerged from the second wave of infections since COVID-19 arrived on our shores in March last year.\nDriven by a new variant of the virus, this second wave was more severe and cost many more lives than the first wave.\nNevertheless, the human cost could have been far greater.\nHad we not moved quickly to restrict movement and activity, had we not prepared our health facilities, had South Africans not observed the basic health protocols, the devastation caused by this virus could have been far worse.\nThis year, we must do everything in our means to contain and overcome this pandemic.\nThis means intensifying our prevention efforts and strengthening our health system.\nIt also means that we must undertake a massive vaccination programme to save lives and dramatically reduce infections across the population.\nEarlier this week, we were informed that one of the vaccines that we had procured, the AstraZeneca vaccine, offers minimal protection from mild to moderate infection by the new variant known as 501Y.v2.\nThis is according to early findings of a study by our scientists and researchers.\nWe applaud these scientists for leading this research and providing new evidence that is vital for guiding our response.\nSince this variant is now the dominant variant in our country, these findings have significant implications for the pace, design and sequencing of our vaccine programme.\nWhile it should not delay the start of the vaccination programme by much, it will affect the choice of vaccines and the manner of their deployment.\nThe first phase of our vaccination programme, which is targeted at health and other frontline workers, will now use the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which has been shown to be effective against the 501Y.V2 variant.\nWe have secured nine million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\nThe first batch, of 80 000 doses, will arrive in the country next week.\nFurther consignments will arrive over the next four weeks, totalling 500 000 Johnson & Johnson vaccines.\nAll provinces have rollout plans in place as the first vaccines come through.\nI wish to thank all provinces for their level of preparedness for this massive undertaking that we are about to embark upon.\nIn addition, we have secured 12 million vaccine doses from the global COVAX facility.\nThis will be complemented by other vaccines that are available to South Africa through the African Union’s (AU) African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team Facility.\nPfizer has committed 20 million vaccine doses, commencing with deliveries at the end of the first quarter.\nWe are continuing our engagements with all the vaccine manufacturers to ensure that we secure sufficient quantities of vaccines that are suitable to our conditions.\nThe health and safety of our people remains our paramount concern.\nAll medication imported into the country is monitored, evaluated, investigated, inspected and registered by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority.\nWe will continue to use the science-driven approach that has served us well since the earliest days of the pandemic.\nThe success of the vaccination programme will rely on active collaboration between all sectors of society.\nWe are greatly encouraged by the active involvement of business, labour, the health industry and medical schemes, in particular, in preparing for this mass vaccination drive.\nAs we have overcome before, we will overcome again and rise.\nBut it is not just this disease that we must defeat.\nWe must overcome poverty, hunger, joblessness and inequality.\nWe must overcome a legacy of exclusion and dispossession that continues to impoverish our people, and which this pandemic has severely worsened.\nWhen I delivered the SoNA in this House last year, none of us could have imagined how – within a matter of weeks – our country and our world would have changed so dramatically.\nOur plans had to be adapted in response to a global emergency.\nBudgets had to be reprioritised and many programmes had to be deferred.\nOver the past year, South Africa has experienced a sharp decline in growth and a significant increase in unemployment.\nPoverty is on the rise. Inequality is deepening.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, our economy was 6% smaller than it was in the last quarter of 2019.\nThere were 1,7 million fewer people employed in the third quarter of 2020 than there were in the first quarter, before the pandemic struck.\nOur unemployment rate now stands at a staggering 30,8%.\nAs a result of the relief measures that we implemented and the phased reopening of the economy, we expect to see a strong recovery in employment by the end of the year.\nAs we worked to contain the spread of the virus, we also had to take extraordinary measures to support ordinary South Africans, assist businesses in distress and protect people’s livelihoods.\nThe Social and Economic Relief Package that we introduced in April last year is the largest intervention of its kind in our history.\nIt identified measures worth a total of R500 billion – or about 10% of our gross domestic product – to provide cash directly to the poorest households, to provide wage support to workers and to provide various forms of relief to struggling businesses.\nA total of 18 million people, or close to one-third of the population, received additional grant payments through these relief measures.\nIt is estimated that this grant lifted more than five million people above the food poverty line, helping to alleviate hunger in a moment of great crisis.\nTo date, more than R57 billion in wage support has been paid to over 4,5 million workers through the special Unemployment Insurance Fund Temporary Employer-Employee Relief Scheme (TERS).\nMore than R1,3 billion has been provided in support mainly for small- and medium-sized businesses.\nIn addition, over R70 billion in tax relief was extended to businesses in distress.\nAround R18,9 billion in loans have been approved for 13 000 businesses through the Loan Guarantee Scheme.\nFellow South Africans,\nIt is nearly four months since I stood here before a joint sitting of this Parliament to present to the nation the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan.\nThis evening, we stand here not to make promises but to report on progress in the implementation of the recovery plan and the priority actions we must take to restore growth and create jobs.\nSince the launch of the plan, we have focused on four priority interventions:\n- a massive rollout of infrastructure throughout the country,\n- a massive increase in local production,\n- an employment stimulus to create jobs and support livelihoods, and\n- the rapid expansion of our energy generation capacity.\nWe announced that we would be embarking on a massive rollout of infrastructure throughout the country.\nWe knew that to achieve this objective we would need to steadily rebuild technical skills within government to prepare and manage large infrastructure projects.\nWe have now developed an infrastructure investment project pipeline worth R340 billion in network industries such as energy, water, transport and telecommunications.\nConstruction has started and progress is being made on a number of these projects.\nSince the announcement of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, we have launched two major human settlements projects that will provide homes to almost 68 000 households in the Gauteng province.\nSimilar human settlements projects are planned in other provinces.\nTwo years ago, I spoke about the dream of building new cities that will enable us to make a break with apartheid’s spatial development.\nNew post-apartheid cities are being conceptualised in a number of places in our country.\nThe Lanseria Smart City, the first new city to be built in a democratic South Africa, is now a reality in the making.\nThe draft masterplan for this smart city – which will become home to between 350 000 to 500 000 people within the next decade – was completed in November 2020 and is now out for public comment.\nProgress is being made on several major water infrastructure projects.\nThese include Phase 2A of the Mokolo and Crocodile River Project, and the uMkhomazi Water Project.\nThe Infrastructure Investment Plan identifies roads projects worth R19 billion covering the spine of the South African road network.\nWork is underway to finalise finance structuring for these projects.\nResources have been committed from the fiscus to support the construction and rehabilitation of the major N1, N2 and N3 highways.\nThese infrastructure projects will lead to the revival of the construction industry and the creation of much-needed jobs.\nThe R100 billion Infrastructure Fund is now in full operation.\nThis fund will blend resources from the fiscus with financing from the private sector and development institutions.\nIts approved project pipeline for 2021 is varied and includes the Student Housing Infrastructure Programme, which aims to provide 300 000 student beds.\nAnother approved project is SA Connect, a programme to roll out broadband to schools, hospitals, police stations and other government facilities.\nThe second priority intervention of the recovery plan is to support a massive increase in local production and to make South African exports globally competitive.\nThis will encourage greater investment by the private sector in productive activity.\nKey to this plan is a renewed commitment from government, business and organised labour to buy local.\nThis commitment should lead to increased local production, which will lead to the revival of our manufacturing industry.\nAll social partners that participated in the development of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, as part of our social compact, have agreed to work together to reduce our reliance on imports by 20% over the next five years.\nThey have identified 42 products – ranging from edible oils to furniture, fruit concentrates, personal protective equipment, steel products and green economy inputs – that can be sourced locally.\nIf we achieve our target, we will significantly expand our productive economy, potentially returning more than R200 billion to the country’s annual output.\nLast year, we undertook to create a larger market for small businesses and designate 1 000 locally produced products that must be procured from Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs).\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic forced the closure of global value chains, we have been able to speed up this initiative as the local supply chains became open for locally manufactured products.\nTo this end, Cabinet approved the SMME-Focused Localisation Policy Framework which identified the 1 000 products.\nFurthermore, the departments of Small Business Development and Trade, Industry and Competition are supporting SMMEs to access larger domestic and international markets.\nThese efforts are supported by robust manufacturing support programmes.\nIn the SoNA last year, I said that our vision for industrialisation is underpinned by sector master plans to rejuvenate and grow key industries.\nFour master plans that have been completed and signed to date – which are part of the social compact between labour, business, government and communities – have already had an impact in their respective industries.\nThrough the implementation of the Poultry Master Plan, the industry has invested R800 million to upgrade production.\nSouth Africa now produces an additional one million chickens every week.\nThe Sugar Master Plan was signed during the lockdown, with a commitment from large users of sugar to procure at least 80% of their sugar needs from local growers.\nThrough the implementation of the plan, last year saw a rise in local production and a decline in imported sugar, creating stability for an industry which employs some 85 000 workers.\nSupport for black small-scale farmers is being stepped up, with a large beverage producer committing to expand their procurement sharply.\nSince the signing of the Clothing, Textile, Footwear and Leather Masterplan in November 2019, the industry has invested more than half a billion rand to expand local manufacturing facilities, including SMMEs.\nWe have worked closely with the auto sector to help it weather the pandemic.\nBy the end of the year, the sector had recovered around 70% of its normal annual production, in difficult circumstances.\nLast week, the Ford Motor Company announced a R16 billion investment to expand their manufacturing facility in Tshwane for the next generation Ford Ranger bakkie.\nThis investment will support the growth of around 12 small and medium enterprises in automotive component manufacturing.\nNearly half of the procurement spend on construction of the bulk earthworks and top structure at the Tshwane Special Economic Zone during this phase is expected to be allocated for SMMEs, an amount equal to R1,7 billion in procurement opportunities.\nToyota has invested in its KwaZulu-Natal facility to start production of the first generation of hybrid electric vehicles to come off a South African assembly line.\nThis follows investment announcements by Nissan, Mercedes Benz and Isuzu in expanded production facilities, all of which cement South Africa’s position as a global player in auto manufacturing.\nThis year, our focus will be on getting the industry back to full production, implementing the Black Industrialist Fund and working on a new platform for expanded auto trade with the rest of the continent.\nThis will be part of our concerted effort to boost the manufacturing sector.\nThis year, we will begin to harness the opportunities presented by the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which came into operation on 1 January, following the adoption of the Johannesburg Declaration by the AU.\nThe AfCFTA provides a platform for South African businesses to expand into markets across the continent, and for South Africa to position itself as a gateway to the continent.\nTo address the deep inequalities in our society, we must accelerate the implementation of broad-based black economic empowerment policies on ownership, control and management of the economy.\nLast year, government agreed to landmark deals with companies that will advance black economic empowerment by transferring ownership to their workers.\nIn November last year, we held our third South Africa Investment Conference to review the implementation of previous commitments and to generate new investment into our economy.\nEven under difficult economic circumstances, the investment conference managed to raise some R108 billion in additional investment commitments.\nTogether with investment confirmed from the two previous conferences, we have now received R773 billion in investment commitments towards our five-year target of R1,2 trillion.\nFirms have reported that some R183 billion of these investments has already flowed into projects that benefit the South African economy.\nThis shows that our country is still an attractive investment destination for both local and offshore companies.\nWe have worked to facilitate investment by increasing the ease of doing business, including making it easier to start a business.\nIn the past year, more than 125 000 new companies were registered through the BizPortal platform, completing their registration in just a matter of hours from the comfort of their homes or offices.\nWe are making it easier for business to do business.\nOur third priority intervention is an employment stimulus to create jobs and support livelihoods.\nThe largest numbers of jobs will be created by the private sector in a number of industries as the economy recovers.\nWe continue to work in a social compact with the private sector to create a more conducive environment for them to be able to create jobs.\nOur compact with the private sector is underpinned by a clear commitment to grow our economy and to create jobs.\nHowever, the public sector has a responsibility to stimulate job creation; both through its policies and through direct job creation opportunities.\nThe Presidential Employment Stimulus is one of the most significant expansions of public and social employment in South Africa’s history.\nBy the end of January 2021, over 430 000 opportunities were already supported through the stimulus.\nA further 180 000 opportunities are currently in the recruitment process.\nThese opportunities are in areas like education, arts and culture, global business services, early childhood development (ECD), and small-scale and subsistence farming.\nIt involves environmental programmes such as the clearing of alien trees, wetland rehabilitation, fire prevention, and cleaning and greening across all municipalities.\nThese programmes are about real lives and real livelihoods.\nNearly half a million people are now receiving an income, developing new skills and contributing to their community and the country’s economy.\nWe will continue to support employment for as long as it is necessary while the labour market recovers, even as we work to promote stronger and more resilient growth in the private sector.\nIn the SoNA last year, in response to the huge challenge our country faces of youth unemployment, I announced that the National Youth Development Agency and the Department of Small Business Development would provide grant funding and business support to 1 000 young entrepreneurs within 100 days.\nWhile the programme had to be put on hold due to the coronavirus restrictions, it nevertheless managed to reach its target of 1 000 businesses by International Youth Day on 12 August 2020.\nThis provides a firm foundation for our efforts to support 15 000 start-ups by 2024.\nLast year, we said we would establish the National Pathway Management Network to provide support and opportunities to young people across the country.\nI want to encourage every young South African to join the more than 1,2 million people who are already in the network, and take their next steps to a better future.\nOf the many hardships our people had to experience last year, schooling disruption placed a huge burden on learners, teachers and families.\nDespite this, they persevered.\nIt is our priority for this year to regain lost time and improve educational outcomes, from the early years through to high school and post-school education and training.\nThe fourth priority intervention of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan is to rapidly expand energy generation capacity.\nRestoring Eskom to operational and financial health and accelerating its restructuring process is central to this objective.\nEskom has been restructured into three separate entities for generation, transmission and distribution.\nThis will lay the foundations for an efficient, modern and competitive energy system.\nEskom is making substantial progress with its intensive maintenance and operational excellence programmes to improve the reliability of its coal fleet.\nWe are working closely with Eskom on proposals to improve its financial position, manage its debt and reduce its dependence on the fiscus.\nThis requires a review of the tariff path to ensure that it reflects all reasonable costs and measures to resolve the problem of municipal debt.\nIn December 2020, government and its social partners signed the historic Eskom Social Compact, which outlines the necessary actions we must take, collectively and as individual constituencies, to meet the country’s energy needs now and into the future.\nOver the last year, we have taken action to urgently and substantially increase generation capacity in addition to what Eskom generates:\n- The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy will soon be announcing the successful bids for 2 000 megawatts (MW) of emergency power.\n- The necessary regulations have been amended and the requirements clarified for municipalities to buy power from independent power producers. Systems are being put in place to support qualifying municipalities.\n- Government will soon be initiating the procurement of an additional 11 800 MW of power from renewable energy, natural gas, battery storage and coal in line with the Integrated Resource Plan 2019.\nDespite this work, Eskom estimates that, without additional capacity, there will be an electricity supply shortfall of between 4 000 and 6 000 MW over the next five years, as old coal-fired power stations reach their end of life.\nAs part of the measures to address this shortfall, we will in the coming weeks issue a request for proposals for 2 600 MW from wind and solar energy as part of Bid Window 5.\nThis will be followed by another bid window in August 2021.\nRecent analysis suggests that easing the licensing requirements for new embedded generation projects could unlock up to 5 000 MW of additional capacity and help to ease the impact of load shedding.\nWe will therefore amend Schedule 2 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 2006 (Act 4 of 2006) within the next three months to increase the licensing threshold for embedded generation.\nThis will include consultation among key stakeholders on the level at which the new threshold should be set and the finalisation of the necessary enabling frameworks.\nEskom has already started work to expedite its commercial and technical processes to allow this additional capacity onto the grid without undue delay.\nAs we mobilise all of the resources at our disposal to support economic recovery, we cannot lose sight of the threat that climate change poses to our environmental health, socioeconomic development and economic growth.\nWe are, therefore, working to fulfil our commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement which include the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\nEskom, our largest greenhouse gas emitter, has committed in principle to net zero emission by 2050 and to increase its renewable capacity.\nEskom will be looking to partner with investors to repurpose and repower part of its coal fleet.\nThis will be done in a way that stimulates investment, local economic activity and local manufacturing, as part of a just transition.\nOur work on climate change will be guided by the Presidential Coordinating Commission on Climate Change, which is meeting for the first time this month.\nThe commission will work on a plan for a just transition to a low-carbon economy and climate resilient society.\nWe will not achieve higher rates of growth and employment if we do not implement structural economic reforms.\nThese reforms are necessary to reduce costs and barriers to entry, increase competition, stimulate new investment and create space for new entrants in the market.\nThis work is being driven through Operation Vulindlela, which involves a team in the National Treasury and the President’s office.\nOperation Vulindlela is focusing on reforms in the electricity, water, telecommunications and transport sectors, as well as reforms to our visa and immigration regime.\nThe completion of digital migration is vital to our ability to effectively harness the enormous opportunities presented by technological change.\nAfter many delays, we will begin the phased switch-off of our analogue television transmitters from next month.\nIt is anticipated that this process, which will be done province-by-province, will be completed by the end of March 2022.\nThe process for the licensing of high-demand spectrum is at an advanced stage.\nWe hope that the ongoing litigation on the licensing matter will provide legal certainty and will not unduly delay the spectrum auction process.\nIn the water sector, we are working through Operation Vulindlela to ensure that water license applications are finalised within the revised timeframe of 90 days; and to revive the Green Drop and Blue Drop programmes to strengthen water quality monitoring.\nWe will finalise and implement the revised Raw Water Pricing Strategy, and accelerate the establishment of a national water resources infrastructure agency.\nOur ability to compete in global markets depends on the efficiency of our ports and rail network.\nWe are repositioning Durban as a hub port for the Southern Hemisphere and developing Ngqura as the container terminal of choice.\nThe rail corridor from Gauteng is being extended to enable the export of vehicles through Port Elizabeth.\nThese are crucial steps to move freight from road to rail and increase the competitiveness of the rail system.\nWork is underway with the relevant departments to reform our visa and immigration regime to attract skills and grow the tourism sector.\nAs international travel starts to recover in the wake of COVID-19, we will undertake a full rollout of eVisas to visitors from China, India, Nigeria, Kenya and 10 other countries.\nThe revised list of critical skills will be published for public comment by the Department of Home Affairs, within one week, to ensure that the final version reflects the skills needed by the economy.\nThe momentum that Operation Vulindlela has already built, and the support that it has received across government, shows that we are serious about reform.\nWe will continue to work relentlessly and without pause to create a more modern, efficient and competitive economy that is more open to all South Africans.\nTo support our reform process, the Presidential State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Council has outlined a clear set of reforms that will enable these vital public companies to fulfil their mandate for growth and development.\nOverarching legislation for state-owned companies will be tabled in Cabinet this financial year and in Parliament in the next the financial year.\nA centralised SOE model is being implemented this financial year, which will ensure a standardised governance, financial management and operational performance framework for all SOEs.\nThe mandates of all SOEs are being re-evaluated to ensure that they are responsive to the country’s needs and the implementation of the National Development Plan.\nIn the midst of the economic damage caused by COVID-19, South Africa’s agricultural sector has performed remarkably well.\nIn 2020, we became the world’s second-largest exporter of citrus, with strong export growth in wine, maize, nuts, deciduous fruit and sugar cane.\nThe favourable weather conditions in 2020 and the beginning of 2021 mean that agriculture is likely to grow in the near term.\nThis provides an opportunity for further public-private partnership in agriculture to promote transformation and ensure sustainable growth.\nIt is an opportunity to accelerate land redistribution through a variety of instruments such as land restitution and expropriation of land in order to boost agricultural output.\nTo date, government has redistributed over five million hectares (ha) of land, totalling around 5 500 farms, to more than 300 000 beneficiaries.\nThis is in addition to the land restitution process, which has benefited over two million land claimants and resulted in the transfer of around 2,7 million ha.\nWe are also pursuing programmes to assist smallholder and emerging farmers with market access, to develop skills across the entire agricultural value chain and increase the number of commercial black farmers.\nDuring the course of the next financial year, we will establish a land and agrarian reform agency to fast-track land reform.\nThe Public Service is at the coalface of government, and lack of professionalism does not just impact service delivery; it also dents public confidence.\nAdvancing honesty, ethics and integrity in the Public Service is critical if we are to build a capable state.\nThrough the National School of Government, we continue to roll out courses and training programmes for government officials from entry level to senior management and the Executive.\nIn October last year, I signed off on ministerial performance agreements with all Ministers, which have now been published online.\nThis will enhance accountability and focused performance by members of the Executive.\nWe remain on course to build a capable and professional civil service that delivers on its mandate and is accountable to the South African people.\nWe are proceeding with our efforts to strengthen the local government infrastructure and accelerate service delivery through the District Development Model.\nThe model brings all three spheres of government to focus on key priorities and implementation of critical high impact projects.\nWorking with both public and private sector partners, government is implementing a range of measures to support municipalities to address inadequate and inconsistent service delivery in areas such water provision, infrastructure build and maintenance.\nWe are focusing on the appointment of properly qualified officials at a local level to ensure effective management and provision of services.\nAs we prepare for local government elections, which are due take place this year, we will need to adjust to the conditions forced upon us by COVID-19 to ensure that the people of this country can determine who represents them at this crucial level of government.\nFellow South Africans,\nCorruption is one of the greatest impediments to the country’s growth and development.\nThe revelations from the Zondo Commission of Inquiry lay bare the extent of state capture and related corruption.\nTestimony at the commission has shown how the criminal justice system was compromised and weakened.\nIt is, therefore, vital that we sustain the momentum of the rebuilding effort that we began three years ago.\nThere has been great progress in turning around law enforcement bodies.\nCritical leadership positions have been filled with capable, experienced and trustworthy professionals.\nThere is improved cooperation and sharing of resources between the respective law enforcement agencies, enabling a more integrated approach to investigations and prosecutions.\nWe have started implementation of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy, which lays the basis for a comprehensive and integrated society-wide response to corruption.\nWe will shortly be appointing members of the National Anti-Corruption Advisory Council, which is a multi-sectoral body that will oversee the initial implementation of the strategy and the establishment of an independent statutory anti-corruption body that reports to Parliament.\nWhen reports started to surface last year about possible fraud and corruption in the procurement of COVID-19-related goods and services, we acted decisively to put a stop to these practices, to investigate all allegations and to act against those responsible.\nWe established a fusion centre, which brings together key law enforcement agencies to share information and resources.\nThe fusion centre has brought many cases to trial and preserved or recovered millions of rands in public funds.\nThe Special Investigating Unit (SIU) was authorised to investigate allegations of unlawful conduct with respect to COVID-19 procurement by all state bodies during the National State of Disaster.\nAs it reported last week, the SIU has finalised investigations into 164 contracts with a total value of R3,5 billion.\nIn a significant advance for transparency and accountability, the Political Party Funding Act, 2018 (Act 6 of 2018) will come into operation on 1 April this year.\nThis will regulate public and private funding of political parties. Among other things, it requires the disclosure of donations to parties and establishes two funds that will enable represented political parties to undertake their programmes.\nCrime and violence continue to undermine people’s sense of safety and security.\nTackling crime is central to the success of our recovery.\nCrimes like cable theft, railway infrastructure vandalism, land invasions, construction site disruptions and attacks on truck drivers hamper economic activity and discourage investment.\nWe have taken steps and will continue to stop these crimes and deal with those responsible in terms of the law.\nTask teams have been set up in a number of provinces to deal with extortion and violence on sites of economic activity.\nWe are also fast-tracking the implementation and capacitation of the Border Management Agency to curb illegal immigration and cross-border crime.\nEnding gender-based violence (GBV) is imperative if we lay claim to being a society rooted in equality and non-sexism.\nWhen I launched the National Strategic Plan on Gender-Based Violence and Femicide (GBVF) in April last year, I made a promise to the women and children of this country that we were going to strengthen the Criminal Justice System to prevent them being traumatised again, and to ensure that perpetrators face justice.\nTo give effect to this, three key pieces of legislation were introduced in Parliament last year to make the criminal justice system more effective in combatting GBV.\nTo ensure that perpetrators are brought to book, we are making progress in reducing the backlog of GBV cases.\nWe continue to provide care and support to survivors of GBV.\nIn the SoNA last year, I said that we would prioritise the economic empowerment of women.\nLast year, Cabinet approved a policy that 40% of public procurement should go to women-owned businesses and entities.\nSeveral departments have started implementing this policy and are making progress.\nLast week, we also launched a groundbreaking private sector-led GBVF Response Fund.\nSeveral South African companies and global philanthropies made pledges to the value of R128 million.\nOver the next three years, government will allocate approximately R12 billion to implement the various components of the National Strategic Plan.\nGBV will only end when everyone takes responsibility for doing so in their homes, in their communities, in their workplaces, in their places of worship and in their schools.\nEqually, we need to give attention to issues affecting children, including improving school-readiness, ECD planning and funding, protection against preventable diseases, policy reform around child welfare and reducing violence against children.\nIn the year ahead, we are also going to forge ahead with efforts to provide greater opportunities for persons with disabilities to participate in the economy and in society in general.\nAs we rebuild our economy in the midst of a pandemic, it is necessary that we continue – within our means – to provide support to those businesses and individuals that continue to be most affected.\nBusinesses in several sectors are still struggling and many families continue to suffer as the job market slowly recovers.\nOver the last few months, we have had ongoing discussions with our social partners in business, labour and community-based organisations, who proposed an extension of some of the social and economic support.\nWe have, therefore, decided to extend the period for the Special COVID-19 Grant of R350 by a further three months.\nThis has proven to be an effective and efficient short-term measure to reduce the immediate impact on the livelihoods of poor South Africans.\nWe have also decided to extend the COVID-19 TERS benefit until 15 March 2021, only for those sectors that have not been able to open and operate.\nThe conditions of this extension and the sectors to be included will be announced after consultations with social partners at the National Economic Development and Labour Council.\nThe National Treasury will work with its partners and stakeholders on improvements to the Loan Guarantee Scheme so that it better addresses the realities of SMMEs and other businesses as they strive to recover.\nWe will work with our social partners to ensure that these and other interventions provide the relief to those who most need it.\nFellow South Africans,\nJust as a harsh fire gives new life to our country’s fynbos, this crisis is an opportunity to build a different, better South Africa.\nRebuilding our country requires a common effort.\nIt requires that all South African take responsibility and play their part.\nLet us work together as government, as business, as labour, as political parties and as all of society to clear away the rubble and lay a new foundation.\nAbove all, let us return this country to the values upon which it was founded.\nOn the day of his release, 31 years ago, Madiba gave his first public address here in Cape Town, where he reminded South Africans that there were difficult days ahead, and that the battle was far from won.\nMadiba said:\n“Now is the time to intensify the Struggle on all fronts.”\n“To relax our efforts now would be a mistake which generations to come will not be able to forgive.”\nIn counting the great cost to our society over the past year, we may be tempted to lose faith.\nBut we can get through this. Because we are a nation of heroes.\nI am referring not to the glorious lineage of Struggle icons, but to the everyday heroes that walk among us, who work hard every day to put food on the table, to keep the company running, and to give support, help and care to our people.\nIt is your resilience that will help this country recover.\nIn addition to the many challenges that beset our people, we have heard that his Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini has not been well in recent days and is admitted to hospital.\nI wish to convey my wishes for the speedy recovery of His Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini ka Bhekuzulu.\nOur thoughts and prayers are with the Royal Household and the Zulu nation at this time.\nIt is our collective wish that Isilo Samabandla Wonke is soon restored to good health.\nAs we prepare for the difficult path ahead, we can draw strength From Maya Angelou’s great poem, Still I rise.\nShe writes:\nOut of the huts of history’s shame\nI rise\nUp from a past that’s rooted in pain\nI rise\nI’m a black ocean, leaping and wide,\nWelling and swelling I bear in the tide.\nLeaving behind nights of terror and fear\nI rise\nInto a daybreak that’s wondrously clear\nI rise\nBringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,\nI am the dream and the hope of the slave.\nI rise I rise I rise.\nPeople of South Africa, it is your country that calls on you to rise.\nLet us march forward together to equality, to growth, to dignity and to recovery.\nMay God bless South Africa and protect her sons and daughters.\nI thank you."}, {"claim": "In the third quarter of 2020, the economy of South Africa was 6% smaller than it was in the third quarter of 2019.", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Supported", "justification": "A decrease of 6.1% in 3rd quarter GDP (2nd QA) rounds down to a decrease of 6% as per the claim.", "claim_date": "11-2-2021", "speaker": "Cyril Ramaphosa ", "original_claim_url": "https://www.gov.za/speeches/president-cyril-ramaphosa-2021-state-nation-address-11-feb-2021-0000", "fact_checking_article": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210316155254/https://africacheck.org/fact-checks/reports/chickens-and-economy-fact-checking-ramaphosas-sona2021", "reporting_source": "speech", "location_ISO_code": "ZA", "claim_types": ["Numerical Claim"], "fact_checking_strategies": ["Written Evidence", "Numerical Comparison"], "questions": [{"question": "What was South Africas GDP in the 3rd quarter of 2019?", "answers": [{"answer": "South Africa’s real GDP was R3,155,290,000,000 (3.16 trillion)", "answer_type": "Extractive", "source_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210202140037/http://www.statssa.gov.za/publications/P0441/P04413rdQuarter2020.pdf#page=11", "source_medium": "Web text"}]}, {"question": "What was South Africas GDP in the 3rd quarter of 2020?", "answers": [{"answer": "By the third quarter of 2020, this had dropped to R2,962,669,000,000, a decrease of 6.1%.", "answer_type": "Abstractive", "source_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210202140037/http://www.statssa.gov.za/publications/P0441/P04413rdQuarter2020.pdf#page=11", "source_medium": "Web text"}]}], "orig_claim": "Eskom is the “largest greenhouse gas emitter” in South Africa.", "orig_verdict": "Correct", "fulltext": "State of the Nation Address by President Cyril Ramaphosa, Parliament, Cape Town\nSpeaker of the National Assembly (NA), Ms Thandi Modise,\nChairperson of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP), Mr Amos Masondo,\nDeputy President David Mabuza,\nFormer President Thabo Mbeki and Mrs Mbeki,\nFormer Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka,\nFormer Deputy President Baleka Mbete,\nChief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng and esteemed members of the Judiciary,\nMinisters and Deputy Ministers,\nHonourable members of the NA,\nHonourable members of the NCOP,\nDean of the European Region, representing the diplomatic corps, His Excellency, Mr Beka Dvali,\nDistinguished guests,\nFellow South Africans,\nOn this day, 31 years ago, President Nelson Mandela walked out of the gates of Victor Verster Prison a free person, a living embodiment of the resilience and courage of the South African people.\nFor nearly 40 million years, an extraordinary ecosystem has existed here at the southernmost tip of our continent.\nThe Fynbos Biome, which stretches across the Cape, has among the most distinctive features of any plants found on earth.\nIt can adapt to dry, hot summers and cold rainy winters. It is wondrous in its diversity.\nOur national flower, the Protea, is a species of fynbos.\nWhen I opened the third National Investment Conference last year, I spoke of the Protea's unique properties that in so many ways resemble our national character.\nWhat is most unique and special about fynbos is that to be sustainable and survive, it needs fire.\nAt least once every twenty years, fynbos must burn at extremely high temperatures to allow the ecosystem to be rejuvenated and grow afresh.\nThroughout the summer, the burned foliage lies desolate. But when the autumn rains return, the seeds germinate, and its life cycle begins all over again.\nThe mountains bloom with new life as plants which once seemed lost grow back even stronger than before.\nWe, the people of South Africa, have over the past year experienced a terrible hardship.\nLike a wildfire that sweeps across the mountainous ranges where the fynbos grows, a deadly pandemic has swept across the world, leaving devastation in its path.\nAnd yet, like the hardy fynbos of our native land, we too have proven to be resilient in many ways.\nFor three centuries, we were victims of oppression, dispossession and injustice.\nAnd for three centuries, we resisted.\nThe flames of injustice may have scarred us, but they did not consume us.\nThe rains of democracy brought rejuvenation and the birth of a new nation.\nWe have risen time and time again from the depths of darkness to herald a new day.\nAs we look on the grave damage that this disease has caused, we know that like the fynbos, like all those who have walked this land before us, we will rise again.\nNearly a year has passed since South Africa saw its first case of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19.\nSince then, nearly one-and-a-half million people in our country are known to have been infected by the virus.\nMore than 45 000 people are known to have died.\nBeyond these statistics lies a human story of tragedy and pain.\nThere is no family, no community and no place of work that has not lost someone they knew, worked with and loved.\nIt is also a story of courage and resilience.\nThe resilience of the hospital worker who – day after day, night after night – goes to work to save lives, knowing that they, themselves, are at risk of infection.\nIt is a wonderful account of the courage of the police officer, the soldier, the essential worker, the carer and all those on the frontline, who have kept our country safe, our people fed and our economy going.\nIt is a story of solidarity and compassion.\nOf a nation that has stood together to confront COVID-19 in ways not seen since the early days of our democracy.\nMore than anything else, this crisis has revealed the true character of our remarkable nation.\nIt has revealed a spirit of the people who refused to be defeated.\nIt is this South African spirit that must drive our resolve to build a new and more equal economy and a better, more just society.\nThe year ahead must be a time for change, for progress and for rebirth.\nIt must be a year in which we rise.\nThis is no ordinary year, and this is no ordinary SoNA.\nI will therefore, focus this evening on the foremost, overriding priorities of 2021.\nFirst, we must defeat the coronavirus pandemic.\nSecond, we must accelerate our economic recovery.\nThird, we must implement economic reforms to create sustainable jobs and drive inclusive growth.\nAnd finally, we must fight corruption and strengthen the State.\nIn the coming weeks, we will address the other important elements of government’s programme for the year.\nFundamental to our nation’s recovery is an unrelenting and comprehensive response to overcome the coronavirus.\nSouth Africa has just emerged from the second wave of infections since COVID-19 arrived on our shores in March last year.\nDriven by a new variant of the virus, this second wave was more severe and cost many more lives than the first wave.\nNevertheless, the human cost could have been far greater.\nHad we not moved quickly to restrict movement and activity, had we not prepared our health facilities, had South Africans not observed the basic health protocols, the devastation caused by this virus could have been far worse.\nThis year, we must do everything in our means to contain and overcome this pandemic.\nThis means intensifying our prevention efforts and strengthening our health system.\nIt also means that we must undertake a massive vaccination programme to save lives and dramatically reduce infections across the population.\nEarlier this week, we were informed that one of the vaccines that we had procured, the AstraZeneca vaccine, offers minimal protection from mild to moderate infection by the new variant known as 501Y.v2.\nThis is according to early findings of a study by our scientists and researchers.\nWe applaud these scientists for leading this research and providing new evidence that is vital for guiding our response.\nSince this variant is now the dominant variant in our country, these findings have significant implications for the pace, design and sequencing of our vaccine programme.\nWhile it should not delay the start of the vaccination programme by much, it will affect the choice of vaccines and the manner of their deployment.\nThe first phase of our vaccination programme, which is targeted at health and other frontline workers, will now use the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which has been shown to be effective against the 501Y.V2 variant.\nWe have secured nine million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\nThe first batch, of 80 000 doses, will arrive in the country next week.\nFurther consignments will arrive over the next four weeks, totalling 500 000 Johnson & Johnson vaccines.\nAll provinces have rollout plans in place as the first vaccines come through.\nI wish to thank all provinces for their level of preparedness for this massive undertaking that we are about to embark upon.\nIn addition, we have secured 12 million vaccine doses from the global COVAX facility.\nThis will be complemented by other vaccines that are available to South Africa through the African Union’s (AU) African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team Facility.\nPfizer has committed 20 million vaccine doses, commencing with deliveries at the end of the first quarter.\nWe are continuing our engagements with all the vaccine manufacturers to ensure that we secure sufficient quantities of vaccines that are suitable to our conditions.\nThe health and safety of our people remains our paramount concern.\nAll medication imported into the country is monitored, evaluated, investigated, inspected and registered by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority.\nWe will continue to use the science-driven approach that has served us well since the earliest days of the pandemic.\nThe success of the vaccination programme will rely on active collaboration between all sectors of society.\nWe are greatly encouraged by the active involvement of business, labour, the health industry and medical schemes, in particular, in preparing for this mass vaccination drive.\nAs we have overcome before, we will overcome again and rise.\nBut it is not just this disease that we must defeat.\nWe must overcome poverty, hunger, joblessness and inequality.\nWe must overcome a legacy of exclusion and dispossession that continues to impoverish our people, and which this pandemic has severely worsened.\nWhen I delivered the SoNA in this House last year, none of us could have imagined how – within a matter of weeks – our country and our world would have changed so dramatically.\nOur plans had to be adapted in response to a global emergency.\nBudgets had to be reprioritised and many programmes had to be deferred.\nOver the past year, South Africa has experienced a sharp decline in growth and a significant increase in unemployment.\nPoverty is on the rise. Inequality is deepening.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, our economy was 6% smaller than it was in the last quarter of 2019.\nThere were 1,7 million fewer people employed in the third quarter of 2020 than there were in the first quarter, before the pandemic struck.\nOur unemployment rate now stands at a staggering 30,8%.\nAs a result of the relief measures that we implemented and the phased reopening of the economy, we expect to see a strong recovery in employment by the end of the year.\nAs we worked to contain the spread of the virus, we also had to take extraordinary measures to support ordinary South Africans, assist businesses in distress and protect people’s livelihoods.\nThe Social and Economic Relief Package that we introduced in April last year is the largest intervention of its kind in our history.\nIt identified measures worth a total of R500 billion – or about 10% of our gross domestic product – to provide cash directly to the poorest households, to provide wage support to workers and to provide various forms of relief to struggling businesses.\nA total of 18 million people, or close to one-third of the population, received additional grant payments through these relief measures.\nIt is estimated that this grant lifted more than five million people above the food poverty line, helping to alleviate hunger in a moment of great crisis.\nTo date, more than R57 billion in wage support has been paid to over 4,5 million workers through the special Unemployment Insurance Fund Temporary Employer-Employee Relief Scheme (TERS).\nMore than R1,3 billion has been provided in support mainly for small- and medium-sized businesses.\nIn addition, over R70 billion in tax relief was extended to businesses in distress.\nAround R18,9 billion in loans have been approved for 13 000 businesses through the Loan Guarantee Scheme.\nFellow South Africans,\nIt is nearly four months since I stood here before a joint sitting of this Parliament to present to the nation the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan.\nThis evening, we stand here not to make promises but to report on progress in the implementation of the recovery plan and the priority actions we must take to restore growth and create jobs.\nSince the launch of the plan, we have focused on four priority interventions:\n- a massive rollout of infrastructure throughout the country,\n- a massive increase in local production,\n- an employment stimulus to create jobs and support livelihoods, and\n- the rapid expansion of our energy generation capacity.\nWe announced that we would be embarking on a massive rollout of infrastructure throughout the country.\nWe knew that to achieve this objective we would need to steadily rebuild technical skills within government to prepare and manage large infrastructure projects.\nWe have now developed an infrastructure investment project pipeline worth R340 billion in network industries such as energy, water, transport and telecommunications.\nConstruction has started and progress is being made on a number of these projects.\nSince the announcement of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, we have launched two major human settlements projects that will provide homes to almost 68 000 households in the Gauteng province.\nSimilar human settlements projects are planned in other provinces.\nTwo years ago, I spoke about the dream of building new cities that will enable us to make a break with apartheid’s spatial development.\nNew post-apartheid cities are being conceptualised in a number of places in our country.\nThe Lanseria Smart City, the first new city to be built in a democratic South Africa, is now a reality in the making.\nThe draft masterplan for this smart city – which will become home to between 350 000 to 500 000 people within the next decade – was completed in November 2020 and is now out for public comment.\nProgress is being made on several major water infrastructure projects.\nThese include Phase 2A of the Mokolo and Crocodile River Project, and the uMkhomazi Water Project.\nThe Infrastructure Investment Plan identifies roads projects worth R19 billion covering the spine of the South African road network.\nWork is underway to finalise finance structuring for these projects.\nResources have been committed from the fiscus to support the construction and rehabilitation of the major N1, N2 and N3 highways.\nThese infrastructure projects will lead to the revival of the construction industry and the creation of much-needed jobs.\nThe R100 billion Infrastructure Fund is now in full operation.\nThis fund will blend resources from the fiscus with financing from the private sector and development institutions.\nIts approved project pipeline for 2021 is varied and includes the Student Housing Infrastructure Programme, which aims to provide 300 000 student beds.\nAnother approved project is SA Connect, a programme to roll out broadband to schools, hospitals, police stations and other government facilities.\nThe second priority intervention of the recovery plan is to support a massive increase in local production and to make South African exports globally competitive.\nThis will encourage greater investment by the private sector in productive activity.\nKey to this plan is a renewed commitment from government, business and organised labour to buy local.\nThis commitment should lead to increased local production, which will lead to the revival of our manufacturing industry.\nAll social partners that participated in the development of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, as part of our social compact, have agreed to work together to reduce our reliance on imports by 20% over the next five years.\nThey have identified 42 products – ranging from edible oils to furniture, fruit concentrates, personal protective equipment, steel products and green economy inputs – that can be sourced locally.\nIf we achieve our target, we will significantly expand our productive economy, potentially returning more than R200 billion to the country’s annual output.\nLast year, we undertook to create a larger market for small businesses and designate 1 000 locally produced products that must be procured from Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs).\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic forced the closure of global value chains, we have been able to speed up this initiative as the local supply chains became open for locally manufactured products.\nTo this end, Cabinet approved the SMME-Focused Localisation Policy Framework which identified the 1 000 products.\nFurthermore, the departments of Small Business Development and Trade, Industry and Competition are supporting SMMEs to access larger domestic and international markets.\nThese efforts are supported by robust manufacturing support programmes.\nIn the SoNA last year, I said that our vision for industrialisation is underpinned by sector master plans to rejuvenate and grow key industries.\nFour master plans that have been completed and signed to date – which are part of the social compact between labour, business, government and communities – have already had an impact in their respective industries.\nThrough the implementation of the Poultry Master Plan, the industry has invested R800 million to upgrade production.\nSouth Africa now produces an additional one million chickens every week.\nThe Sugar Master Plan was signed during the lockdown, with a commitment from large users of sugar to procure at least 80% of their sugar needs from local growers.\nThrough the implementation of the plan, last year saw a rise in local production and a decline in imported sugar, creating stability for an industry which employs some 85 000 workers.\nSupport for black small-scale farmers is being stepped up, with a large beverage producer committing to expand their procurement sharply.\nSince the signing of the Clothing, Textile, Footwear and Leather Masterplan in November 2019, the industry has invested more than half a billion rand to expand local manufacturing facilities, including SMMEs.\nWe have worked closely with the auto sector to help it weather the pandemic.\nBy the end of the year, the sector had recovered around 70% of its normal annual production, in difficult circumstances.\nLast week, the Ford Motor Company announced a R16 billion investment to expand their manufacturing facility in Tshwane for the next generation Ford Ranger bakkie.\nThis investment will support the growth of around 12 small and medium enterprises in automotive component manufacturing.\nNearly half of the procurement spend on construction of the bulk earthworks and top structure at the Tshwane Special Economic Zone during this phase is expected to be allocated for SMMEs, an amount equal to R1,7 billion in procurement opportunities.\nToyota has invested in its KwaZulu-Natal facility to start production of the first generation of hybrid electric vehicles to come off a South African assembly line.\nThis follows investment announcements by Nissan, Mercedes Benz and Isuzu in expanded production facilities, all of which cement South Africa’s position as a global player in auto manufacturing.\nThis year, our focus will be on getting the industry back to full production, implementing the Black Industrialist Fund and working on a new platform for expanded auto trade with the rest of the continent.\nThis will be part of our concerted effort to boost the manufacturing sector.\nThis year, we will begin to harness the opportunities presented by the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which came into operation on 1 January, following the adoption of the Johannesburg Declaration by the AU.\nThe AfCFTA provides a platform for South African businesses to expand into markets across the continent, and for South Africa to position itself as a gateway to the continent.\nTo address the deep inequalities in our society, we must accelerate the implementation of broad-based black economic empowerment policies on ownership, control and management of the economy.\nLast year, government agreed to landmark deals with companies that will advance black economic empowerment by transferring ownership to their workers.\nIn November last year, we held our third South Africa Investment Conference to review the implementation of previous commitments and to generate new investment into our economy.\nEven under difficult economic circumstances, the investment conference managed to raise some R108 billion in additional investment commitments.\nTogether with investment confirmed from the two previous conferences, we have now received R773 billion in investment commitments towards our five-year target of R1,2 trillion.\nFirms have reported that some R183 billion of these investments has already flowed into projects that benefit the South African economy.\nThis shows that our country is still an attractive investment destination for both local and offshore companies.\nWe have worked to facilitate investment by increasing the ease of doing business, including making it easier to start a business.\nIn the past year, more than 125 000 new companies were registered through the BizPortal platform, completing their registration in just a matter of hours from the comfort of their homes or offices.\nWe are making it easier for business to do business.\nOur third priority intervention is an employment stimulus to create jobs and support livelihoods.\nThe largest numbers of jobs will be created by the private sector in a number of industries as the economy recovers.\nWe continue to work in a social compact with the private sector to create a more conducive environment for them to be able to create jobs.\nOur compact with the private sector is underpinned by a clear commitment to grow our economy and to create jobs.\nHowever, the public sector has a responsibility to stimulate job creation; both through its policies and through direct job creation opportunities.\nThe Presidential Employment Stimulus is one of the most significant expansions of public and social employment in South Africa’s history.\nBy the end of January 2021, over 430 000 opportunities were already supported through the stimulus.\nA further 180 000 opportunities are currently in the recruitment process.\nThese opportunities are in areas like education, arts and culture, global business services, early childhood development (ECD), and small-scale and subsistence farming.\nIt involves environmental programmes such as the clearing of alien trees, wetland rehabilitation, fire prevention, and cleaning and greening across all municipalities.\nThese programmes are about real lives and real livelihoods.\nNearly half a million people are now receiving an income, developing new skills and contributing to their community and the country’s economy.\nWe will continue to support employment for as long as it is necessary while the labour market recovers, even as we work to promote stronger and more resilient growth in the private sector.\nIn the SoNA last year, in response to the huge challenge our country faces of youth unemployment, I announced that the National Youth Development Agency and the Department of Small Business Development would provide grant funding and business support to 1 000 young entrepreneurs within 100 days.\nWhile the programme had to be put on hold due to the coronavirus restrictions, it nevertheless managed to reach its target of 1 000 businesses by International Youth Day on 12 August 2020.\nThis provides a firm foundation for our efforts to support 15 000 start-ups by 2024.\nLast year, we said we would establish the National Pathway Management Network to provide support and opportunities to young people across the country.\nI want to encourage every young South African to join the more than 1,2 million people who are already in the network, and take their next steps to a better future.\nOf the many hardships our people had to experience last year, schooling disruption placed a huge burden on learners, teachers and families.\nDespite this, they persevered.\nIt is our priority for this year to regain lost time and improve educational outcomes, from the early years through to high school and post-school education and training.\nThe fourth priority intervention of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan is to rapidly expand energy generation capacity.\nRestoring Eskom to operational and financial health and accelerating its restructuring process is central to this objective.\nEskom has been restructured into three separate entities for generation, transmission and distribution.\nThis will lay the foundations for an efficient, modern and competitive energy system.\nEskom is making substantial progress with its intensive maintenance and operational excellence programmes to improve the reliability of its coal fleet.\nWe are working closely with Eskom on proposals to improve its financial position, manage its debt and reduce its dependence on the fiscus.\nThis requires a review of the tariff path to ensure that it reflects all reasonable costs and measures to resolve the problem of municipal debt.\nIn December 2020, government and its social partners signed the historic Eskom Social Compact, which outlines the necessary actions we must take, collectively and as individual constituencies, to meet the country’s energy needs now and into the future.\nOver the last year, we have taken action to urgently and substantially increase generation capacity in addition to what Eskom generates:\n- The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy will soon be announcing the successful bids for 2 000 megawatts (MW) of emergency power.\n- The necessary regulations have been amended and the requirements clarified for municipalities to buy power from independent power producers. Systems are being put in place to support qualifying municipalities.\n- Government will soon be initiating the procurement of an additional 11 800 MW of power from renewable energy, natural gas, battery storage and coal in line with the Integrated Resource Plan 2019.\nDespite this work, Eskom estimates that, without additional capacity, there will be an electricity supply shortfall of between 4 000 and 6 000 MW over the next five years, as old coal-fired power stations reach their end of life.\nAs part of the measures to address this shortfall, we will in the coming weeks issue a request for proposals for 2 600 MW from wind and solar energy as part of Bid Window 5.\nThis will be followed by another bid window in August 2021.\nRecent analysis suggests that easing the licensing requirements for new embedded generation projects could unlock up to 5 000 MW of additional capacity and help to ease the impact of load shedding.\nWe will therefore amend Schedule 2 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 2006 (Act 4 of 2006) within the next three months to increase the licensing threshold for embedded generation.\nThis will include consultation among key stakeholders on the level at which the new threshold should be set and the finalisation of the necessary enabling frameworks.\nEskom has already started work to expedite its commercial and technical processes to allow this additional capacity onto the grid without undue delay.\nAs we mobilise all of the resources at our disposal to support economic recovery, we cannot lose sight of the threat that climate change poses to our environmental health, socioeconomic development and economic growth.\nWe are, therefore, working to fulfil our commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement which include the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\nEskom, our largest greenhouse gas emitter, has committed in principle to net zero emission by 2050 and to increase its renewable capacity.\nEskom will be looking to partner with investors to repurpose and repower part of its coal fleet.\nThis will be done in a way that stimulates investment, local economic activity and local manufacturing, as part of a just transition.\nOur work on climate change will be guided by the Presidential Coordinating Commission on Climate Change, which is meeting for the first time this month.\nThe commission will work on a plan for a just transition to a low-carbon economy and climate resilient society.\nWe will not achieve higher rates of growth and employment if we do not implement structural economic reforms.\nThese reforms are necessary to reduce costs and barriers to entry, increase competition, stimulate new investment and create space for new entrants in the market.\nThis work is being driven through Operation Vulindlela, which involves a team in the National Treasury and the President’s office.\nOperation Vulindlela is focusing on reforms in the electricity, water, telecommunications and transport sectors, as well as reforms to our visa and immigration regime.\nThe completion of digital migration is vital to our ability to effectively harness the enormous opportunities presented by technological change.\nAfter many delays, we will begin the phased switch-off of our analogue television transmitters from next month.\nIt is anticipated that this process, which will be done province-by-province, will be completed by the end of March 2022.\nThe process for the licensing of high-demand spectrum is at an advanced stage.\nWe hope that the ongoing litigation on the licensing matter will provide legal certainty and will not unduly delay the spectrum auction process.\nIn the water sector, we are working through Operation Vulindlela to ensure that water license applications are finalised within the revised timeframe of 90 days; and to revive the Green Drop and Blue Drop programmes to strengthen water quality monitoring.\nWe will finalise and implement the revised Raw Water Pricing Strategy, and accelerate the establishment of a national water resources infrastructure agency.\nOur ability to compete in global markets depends on the efficiency of our ports and rail network.\nWe are repositioning Durban as a hub port for the Southern Hemisphere and developing Ngqura as the container terminal of choice.\nThe rail corridor from Gauteng is being extended to enable the export of vehicles through Port Elizabeth.\nThese are crucial steps to move freight from road to rail and increase the competitiveness of the rail system.\nWork is underway with the relevant departments to reform our visa and immigration regime to attract skills and grow the tourism sector.\nAs international travel starts to recover in the wake of COVID-19, we will undertake a full rollout of eVisas to visitors from China, India, Nigeria, Kenya and 10 other countries.\nThe revised list of critical skills will be published for public comment by the Department of Home Affairs, within one week, to ensure that the final version reflects the skills needed by the economy.\nThe momentum that Operation Vulindlela has already built, and the support that it has received across government, shows that we are serious about reform.\nWe will continue to work relentlessly and without pause to create a more modern, efficient and competitive economy that is more open to all South Africans.\nTo support our reform process, the Presidential State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Council has outlined a clear set of reforms that will enable these vital public companies to fulfil their mandate for growth and development.\nOverarching legislation for state-owned companies will be tabled in Cabinet this financial year and in Parliament in the next the financial year.\nA centralised SOE model is being implemented this financial year, which will ensure a standardised governance, financial management and operational performance framework for all SOEs.\nThe mandates of all SOEs are being re-evaluated to ensure that they are responsive to the country’s needs and the implementation of the National Development Plan.\nIn the midst of the economic damage caused by COVID-19, South Africa’s agricultural sector has performed remarkably well.\nIn 2020, we became the world’s second-largest exporter of citrus, with strong export growth in wine, maize, nuts, deciduous fruit and sugar cane.\nThe favourable weather conditions in 2020 and the beginning of 2021 mean that agriculture is likely to grow in the near term.\nThis provides an opportunity for further public-private partnership in agriculture to promote transformation and ensure sustainable growth.\nIt is an opportunity to accelerate land redistribution through a variety of instruments such as land restitution and expropriation of land in order to boost agricultural output.\nTo date, government has redistributed over five million hectares (ha) of land, totalling around 5 500 farms, to more than 300 000 beneficiaries.\nThis is in addition to the land restitution process, which has benefited over two million land claimants and resulted in the transfer of around 2,7 million ha.\nWe are also pursuing programmes to assist smallholder and emerging farmers with market access, to develop skills across the entire agricultural value chain and increase the number of commercial black farmers.\nDuring the course of the next financial year, we will establish a land and agrarian reform agency to fast-track land reform.\nThe Public Service is at the coalface of government, and lack of professionalism does not just impact service delivery; it also dents public confidence.\nAdvancing honesty, ethics and integrity in the Public Service is critical if we are to build a capable state.\nThrough the National School of Government, we continue to roll out courses and training programmes for government officials from entry level to senior management and the Executive.\nIn October last year, I signed off on ministerial performance agreements with all Ministers, which have now been published online.\nThis will enhance accountability and focused performance by members of the Executive.\nWe remain on course to build a capable and professional civil service that delivers on its mandate and is accountable to the South African people.\nWe are proceeding with our efforts to strengthen the local government infrastructure and accelerate service delivery through the District Development Model.\nThe model brings all three spheres of government to focus on key priorities and implementation of critical high impact projects.\nWorking with both public and private sector partners, government is implementing a range of measures to support municipalities to address inadequate and inconsistent service delivery in areas such water provision, infrastructure build and maintenance.\nWe are focusing on the appointment of properly qualified officials at a local level to ensure effective management and provision of services.\nAs we prepare for local government elections, which are due take place this year, we will need to adjust to the conditions forced upon us by COVID-19 to ensure that the people of this country can determine who represents them at this crucial level of government.\nFellow South Africans,\nCorruption is one of the greatest impediments to the country’s growth and development.\nThe revelations from the Zondo Commission of Inquiry lay bare the extent of state capture and related corruption.\nTestimony at the commission has shown how the criminal justice system was compromised and weakened.\nIt is, therefore, vital that we sustain the momentum of the rebuilding effort that we began three years ago.\nThere has been great progress in turning around law enforcement bodies.\nCritical leadership positions have been filled with capable, experienced and trustworthy professionals.\nThere is improved cooperation and sharing of resources between the respective law enforcement agencies, enabling a more integrated approach to investigations and prosecutions.\nWe have started implementation of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy, which lays the basis for a comprehensive and integrated society-wide response to corruption.\nWe will shortly be appointing members of the National Anti-Corruption Advisory Council, which is a multi-sectoral body that will oversee the initial implementation of the strategy and the establishment of an independent statutory anti-corruption body that reports to Parliament.\nWhen reports started to surface last year about possible fraud and corruption in the procurement of COVID-19-related goods and services, we acted decisively to put a stop to these practices, to investigate all allegations and to act against those responsible.\nWe established a fusion centre, which brings together key law enforcement agencies to share information and resources.\nThe fusion centre has brought many cases to trial and preserved or recovered millions of rands in public funds.\nThe Special Investigating Unit (SIU) was authorised to investigate allegations of unlawful conduct with respect to COVID-19 procurement by all state bodies during the National State of Disaster.\nAs it reported last week, the SIU has finalised investigations into 164 contracts with a total value of R3,5 billion.\nIn a significant advance for transparency and accountability, the Political Party Funding Act, 2018 (Act 6 of 2018) will come into operation on 1 April this year.\nThis will regulate public and private funding of political parties. Among other things, it requires the disclosure of donations to parties and establishes two funds that will enable represented political parties to undertake their programmes.\nCrime and violence continue to undermine people’s sense of safety and security.\nTackling crime is central to the success of our recovery.\nCrimes like cable theft, railway infrastructure vandalism, land invasions, construction site disruptions and attacks on truck drivers hamper economic activity and discourage investment.\nWe have taken steps and will continue to stop these crimes and deal with those responsible in terms of the law.\nTask teams have been set up in a number of provinces to deal with extortion and violence on sites of economic activity.\nWe are also fast-tracking the implementation and capacitation of the Border Management Agency to curb illegal immigration and cross-border crime.\nEnding gender-based violence (GBV) is imperative if we lay claim to being a society rooted in equality and non-sexism.\nWhen I launched the National Strategic Plan on Gender-Based Violence and Femicide (GBVF) in April last year, I made a promise to the women and children of this country that we were going to strengthen the Criminal Justice System to prevent them being traumatised again, and to ensure that perpetrators face justice.\nTo give effect to this, three key pieces of legislation were introduced in Parliament last year to make the criminal justice system more effective in combatting GBV.\nTo ensure that perpetrators are brought to book, we are making progress in reducing the backlog of GBV cases.\nWe continue to provide care and support to survivors of GBV.\nIn the SoNA last year, I said that we would prioritise the economic empowerment of women.\nLast year, Cabinet approved a policy that 40% of public procurement should go to women-owned businesses and entities.\nSeveral departments have started implementing this policy and are making progress.\nLast week, we also launched a groundbreaking private sector-led GBVF Response Fund.\nSeveral South African companies and global philanthropies made pledges to the value of R128 million.\nOver the next three years, government will allocate approximately R12 billion to implement the various components of the National Strategic Plan.\nGBV will only end when everyone takes responsibility for doing so in their homes, in their communities, in their workplaces, in their places of worship and in their schools.\nEqually, we need to give attention to issues affecting children, including improving school-readiness, ECD planning and funding, protection against preventable diseases, policy reform around child welfare and reducing violence against children.\nIn the year ahead, we are also going to forge ahead with efforts to provide greater opportunities for persons with disabilities to participate in the economy and in society in general.\nAs we rebuild our economy in the midst of a pandemic, it is necessary that we continue – within our means – to provide support to those businesses and individuals that continue to be most affected.\nBusinesses in several sectors are still struggling and many families continue to suffer as the job market slowly recovers.\nOver the last few months, we have had ongoing discussions with our social partners in business, labour and community-based organisations, who proposed an extension of some of the social and economic support.\nWe have, therefore, decided to extend the period for the Special COVID-19 Grant of R350 by a further three months.\nThis has proven to be an effective and efficient short-term measure to reduce the immediate impact on the livelihoods of poor South Africans.\nWe have also decided to extend the COVID-19 TERS benefit until 15 March 2021, only for those sectors that have not been able to open and operate.\nThe conditions of this extension and the sectors to be included will be announced after consultations with social partners at the National Economic Development and Labour Council.\nThe National Treasury will work with its partners and stakeholders on improvements to the Loan Guarantee Scheme so that it better addresses the realities of SMMEs and other businesses as they strive to recover.\nWe will work with our social partners to ensure that these and other interventions provide the relief to those who most need it.\nFellow South Africans,\nJust as a harsh fire gives new life to our country’s fynbos, this crisis is an opportunity to build a different, better South Africa.\nRebuilding our country requires a common effort.\nIt requires that all South African take responsibility and play their part.\nLet us work together as government, as business, as labour, as political parties and as all of society to clear away the rubble and lay a new foundation.\nAbove all, let us return this country to the values upon which it was founded.\nOn the day of his release, 31 years ago, Madiba gave his first public address here in Cape Town, where he reminded South Africans that there were difficult days ahead, and that the battle was far from won.\nMadiba said:\n“Now is the time to intensify the Struggle on all fronts.”\n“To relax our efforts now would be a mistake which generations to come will not be able to forgive.”\nIn counting the great cost to our society over the past year, we may be tempted to lose faith.\nBut we can get through this. Because we are a nation of heroes.\nI am referring not to the glorious lineage of Struggle icons, but to the everyday heroes that walk among us, who work hard every day to put food on the table, to keep the company running, and to give support, help and care to our people.\nIt is your resilience that will help this country recover.\nIn addition to the many challenges that beset our people, we have heard that his Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini has not been well in recent days and is admitted to hospital.\nI wish to convey my wishes for the speedy recovery of His Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini ka Bhekuzulu.\nOur thoughts and prayers are with the Royal Household and the Zulu nation at this time.\nIt is our collective wish that Isilo Samabandla Wonke is soon restored to good health.\nAs we prepare for the difficult path ahead, we can draw strength From Maya Angelou’s great poem, Still I rise.\nShe writes:\nOut of the huts of history’s shame\nI rise\nUp from a past that’s rooted in pain\nI rise\nI’m a black ocean, leaping and wide,\nWelling and swelling I bear in the tide.\nLeaving behind nights of terror and fear\nI rise\nInto a daybreak that’s wondrously clear\nI rise\nBringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,\nI am the dream and the hope of the slave.\nI rise I rise I rise.\nPeople of South Africa, it is your country that calls on you to rise.\nLet us march forward together to equality, to growth, to dignity and to recovery.\nMay God bless South Africa and protect her sons and daughters.\nI thank you."}, {"claim": "In South Africa 2.7 million hectares of land have been transferred through the land restitution process", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Refuted", "justification": "Actual figure is 3,483,269 hectares.", "claim_date": "11-2-2021", "speaker": "President Cyril Ramaphosa", "original_claim_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210316155254/https://www.gov.za/speeches/president-cyril-ramaphosa-2021-state-nation-address-11-feb-2021-0000", "fact_checking_article": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210316155254/https://africacheck.org/fact-checks/reports/chickens-and-economy-fact-checking-ramaphosas-sona2021", "reporting_source": "2021 State of the Nation Address", "location_ISO_code": "ZA", "claim_types": ["Numerical Claim"], "fact_checking_strategies": ["Written Evidence"], "questions": [{"question": "According to the Department of Agriculture, rural development and land reform what amount of land was restituted between 1995 and 2018?", "answers": [{"answer": "3,483,269 hectares.", "answer_type": "Extractive", "source_url": "https://africacheck.org/sites/default/files/media/documents/2021-02/ANNUAL_STATISTICAL_REPORT_FOR_SELECTED_-_Until_2018.pdf", "source_medium": "PDF"}]}], "orig_claim": "Eskom is the “largest greenhouse gas emitter” in South Africa.", "orig_verdict": "Correct", "fulltext": "State of the Nation Address by President Cyril Ramaphosa, Parliament, Cape Town\nSpeaker of the National Assembly (NA), Ms Thandi Modise,\nChairperson of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP), Mr Amos Masondo,\nDeputy President David Mabuza,\nFormer President Thabo Mbeki and Mrs Mbeki,\nFormer Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka,\nFormer Deputy President Baleka Mbete,\nChief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng and esteemed members of the Judiciary,\nMinisters and Deputy Ministers,\nHonourable members of the NA,\nHonourable members of the NCOP,\nDean of the European Region, representing the diplomatic corps, His Excellency, Mr Beka Dvali,\nDistinguished guests,\nFellow South Africans,\nOn this day, 31 years ago, President Nelson Mandela walked out of the gates of Victor Verster Prison a free person, a living embodiment of the resilience and courage of the South African people.\nFor nearly 40 million years, an extraordinary ecosystem has existed here at the southernmost tip of our continent.\nThe Fynbos Biome, which stretches across the Cape, has among the most distinctive features of any plants found on earth.\nIt can adapt to dry, hot summers and cold rainy winters. It is wondrous in its diversity.\nOur national flower, the Protea, is a species of fynbos.\nWhen I opened the third National Investment Conference last year, I spoke of the Protea's unique properties that in so many ways resemble our national character.\nWhat is most unique and special about fynbos is that to be sustainable and survive, it needs fire.\nAt least once every twenty years, fynbos must burn at extremely high temperatures to allow the ecosystem to be rejuvenated and grow afresh.\nThroughout the summer, the burned foliage lies desolate. But when the autumn rains return, the seeds germinate, and its life cycle begins all over again.\nThe mountains bloom with new life as plants which once seemed lost grow back even stronger than before.\nWe, the people of South Africa, have over the past year experienced a terrible hardship.\nLike a wildfire that sweeps across the mountainous ranges where the fynbos grows, a deadly pandemic has swept across the world, leaving devastation in its path.\nAnd yet, like the hardy fynbos of our native land, we too have proven to be resilient in many ways.\nFor three centuries, we were victims of oppression, dispossession and injustice.\nAnd for three centuries, we resisted.\nThe flames of injustice may have scarred us, but they did not consume us.\nThe rains of democracy brought rejuvenation and the birth of a new nation.\nWe have risen time and time again from the depths of darkness to herald a new day.\nAs we look on the grave damage that this disease has caused, we know that like the fynbos, like all those who have walked this land before us, we will rise again.\nNearly a year has passed since South Africa saw its first case of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19.\nSince then, nearly one-and-a-half million people in our country are known to have been infected by the virus.\nMore than 45 000 people are known to have died.\nBeyond these statistics lies a human story of tragedy and pain.\nThere is no family, no community and no place of work that has not lost someone they knew, worked with and loved.\nIt is also a story of courage and resilience.\nThe resilience of the hospital worker who – day after day, night after night – goes to work to save lives, knowing that they, themselves, are at risk of infection.\nIt is a wonderful account of the courage of the police officer, the soldier, the essential worker, the carer and all those on the frontline, who have kept our country safe, our people fed and our economy going.\nIt is a story of solidarity and compassion.\nOf a nation that has stood together to confront COVID-19 in ways not seen since the early days of our democracy.\nMore than anything else, this crisis has revealed the true character of our remarkable nation.\nIt has revealed a spirit of the people who refused to be defeated.\nIt is this South African spirit that must drive our resolve to build a new and more equal economy and a better, more just society.\nThe year ahead must be a time for change, for progress and for rebirth.\nIt must be a year in which we rise.\nThis is no ordinary year, and this is no ordinary SoNA.\nI will therefore, focus this evening on the foremost, overriding priorities of 2021.\nFirst, we must defeat the coronavirus pandemic.\nSecond, we must accelerate our economic recovery.\nThird, we must implement economic reforms to create sustainable jobs and drive inclusive growth.\nAnd finally, we must fight corruption and strengthen the State.\nIn the coming weeks, we will address the other important elements of government’s programme for the year.\nFundamental to our nation’s recovery is an unrelenting and comprehensive response to overcome the coronavirus.\nSouth Africa has just emerged from the second wave of infections since COVID-19 arrived on our shores in March last year.\nDriven by a new variant of the virus, this second wave was more severe and cost many more lives than the first wave.\nNevertheless, the human cost could have been far greater.\nHad we not moved quickly to restrict movement and activity, had we not prepared our health facilities, had South Africans not observed the basic health protocols, the devastation caused by this virus could have been far worse.\nThis year, we must do everything in our means to contain and overcome this pandemic.\nThis means intensifying our prevention efforts and strengthening our health system.\nIt also means that we must undertake a massive vaccination programme to save lives and dramatically reduce infections across the population.\nEarlier this week, we were informed that one of the vaccines that we had procured, the AstraZeneca vaccine, offers minimal protection from mild to moderate infection by the new variant known as 501Y.v2.\nThis is according to early findings of a study by our scientists and researchers.\nWe applaud these scientists for leading this research and providing new evidence that is vital for guiding our response.\nSince this variant is now the dominant variant in our country, these findings have significant implications for the pace, design and sequencing of our vaccine programme.\nWhile it should not delay the start of the vaccination programme by much, it will affect the choice of vaccines and the manner of their deployment.\nThe first phase of our vaccination programme, which is targeted at health and other frontline workers, will now use the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which has been shown to be effective against the 501Y.V2 variant.\nWe have secured nine million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\nThe first batch, of 80 000 doses, will arrive in the country next week.\nFurther consignments will arrive over the next four weeks, totalling 500 000 Johnson & Johnson vaccines.\nAll provinces have rollout plans in place as the first vaccines come through.\nI wish to thank all provinces for their level of preparedness for this massive undertaking that we are about to embark upon.\nIn addition, we have secured 12 million vaccine doses from the global COVAX facility.\nThis will be complemented by other vaccines that are available to South Africa through the African Union’s (AU) African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team Facility.\nPfizer has committed 20 million vaccine doses, commencing with deliveries at the end of the first quarter.\nWe are continuing our engagements with all the vaccine manufacturers to ensure that we secure sufficient quantities of vaccines that are suitable to our conditions.\nThe health and safety of our people remains our paramount concern.\nAll medication imported into the country is monitored, evaluated, investigated, inspected and registered by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority.\nWe will continue to use the science-driven approach that has served us well since the earliest days of the pandemic.\nThe success of the vaccination programme will rely on active collaboration between all sectors of society.\nWe are greatly encouraged by the active involvement of business, labour, the health industry and medical schemes, in particular, in preparing for this mass vaccination drive.\nAs we have overcome before, we will overcome again and rise.\nBut it is not just this disease that we must defeat.\nWe must overcome poverty, hunger, joblessness and inequality.\nWe must overcome a legacy of exclusion and dispossession that continues to impoverish our people, and which this pandemic has severely worsened.\nWhen I delivered the SoNA in this House last year, none of us could have imagined how – within a matter of weeks – our country and our world would have changed so dramatically.\nOur plans had to be adapted in response to a global emergency.\nBudgets had to be reprioritised and many programmes had to be deferred.\nOver the past year, South Africa has experienced a sharp decline in growth and a significant increase in unemployment.\nPoverty is on the rise. Inequality is deepening.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, our economy was 6% smaller than it was in the last quarter of 2019.\nThere were 1,7 million fewer people employed in the third quarter of 2020 than there were in the first quarter, before the pandemic struck.\nOur unemployment rate now stands at a staggering 30,8%.\nAs a result of the relief measures that we implemented and the phased reopening of the economy, we expect to see a strong recovery in employment by the end of the year.\nAs we worked to contain the spread of the virus, we also had to take extraordinary measures to support ordinary South Africans, assist businesses in distress and protect people’s livelihoods.\nThe Social and Economic Relief Package that we introduced in April last year is the largest intervention of its kind in our history.\nIt identified measures worth a total of R500 billion – or about 10% of our gross domestic product – to provide cash directly to the poorest households, to provide wage support to workers and to provide various forms of relief to struggling businesses.\nA total of 18 million people, or close to one-third of the population, received additional grant payments through these relief measures.\nIt is estimated that this grant lifted more than five million people above the food poverty line, helping to alleviate hunger in a moment of great crisis.\nTo date, more than R57 billion in wage support has been paid to over 4,5 million workers through the special Unemployment Insurance Fund Temporary Employer-Employee Relief Scheme (TERS).\nMore than R1,3 billion has been provided in support mainly for small- and medium-sized businesses.\nIn addition, over R70 billion in tax relief was extended to businesses in distress.\nAround R18,9 billion in loans have been approved for 13 000 businesses through the Loan Guarantee Scheme.\nFellow South Africans,\nIt is nearly four months since I stood here before a joint sitting of this Parliament to present to the nation the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan.\nThis evening, we stand here not to make promises but to report on progress in the implementation of the recovery plan and the priority actions we must take to restore growth and create jobs.\nSince the launch of the plan, we have focused on four priority interventions:\n- a massive rollout of infrastructure throughout the country,\n- a massive increase in local production,\n- an employment stimulus to create jobs and support livelihoods, and\n- the rapid expansion of our energy generation capacity.\nWe announced that we would be embarking on a massive rollout of infrastructure throughout the country.\nWe knew that to achieve this objective we would need to steadily rebuild technical skills within government to prepare and manage large infrastructure projects.\nWe have now developed an infrastructure investment project pipeline worth R340 billion in network industries such as energy, water, transport and telecommunications.\nConstruction has started and progress is being made on a number of these projects.\nSince the announcement of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, we have launched two major human settlements projects that will provide homes to almost 68 000 households in the Gauteng province.\nSimilar human settlements projects are planned in other provinces.\nTwo years ago, I spoke about the dream of building new cities that will enable us to make a break with apartheid’s spatial development.\nNew post-apartheid cities are being conceptualised in a number of places in our country.\nThe Lanseria Smart City, the first new city to be built in a democratic South Africa, is now a reality in the making.\nThe draft masterplan for this smart city – which will become home to between 350 000 to 500 000 people within the next decade – was completed in November 2020 and is now out for public comment.\nProgress is being made on several major water infrastructure projects.\nThese include Phase 2A of the Mokolo and Crocodile River Project, and the uMkhomazi Water Project.\nThe Infrastructure Investment Plan identifies roads projects worth R19 billion covering the spine of the South African road network.\nWork is underway to finalise finance structuring for these projects.\nResources have been committed from the fiscus to support the construction and rehabilitation of the major N1, N2 and N3 highways.\nThese infrastructure projects will lead to the revival of the construction industry and the creation of much-needed jobs.\nThe R100 billion Infrastructure Fund is now in full operation.\nThis fund will blend resources from the fiscus with financing from the private sector and development institutions.\nIts approved project pipeline for 2021 is varied and includes the Student Housing Infrastructure Programme, which aims to provide 300 000 student beds.\nAnother approved project is SA Connect, a programme to roll out broadband to schools, hospitals, police stations and other government facilities.\nThe second priority intervention of the recovery plan is to support a massive increase in local production and to make South African exports globally competitive.\nThis will encourage greater investment by the private sector in productive activity.\nKey to this plan is a renewed commitment from government, business and organised labour to buy local.\nThis commitment should lead to increased local production, which will lead to the revival of our manufacturing industry.\nAll social partners that participated in the development of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, as part of our social compact, have agreed to work together to reduce our reliance on imports by 20% over the next five years.\nThey have identified 42 products – ranging from edible oils to furniture, fruit concentrates, personal protective equipment, steel products and green economy inputs – that can be sourced locally.\nIf we achieve our target, we will significantly expand our productive economy, potentially returning more than R200 billion to the country’s annual output.\nLast year, we undertook to create a larger market for small businesses and designate 1 000 locally produced products that must be procured from Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs).\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic forced the closure of global value chains, we have been able to speed up this initiative as the local supply chains became open for locally manufactured products.\nTo this end, Cabinet approved the SMME-Focused Localisation Policy Framework which identified the 1 000 products.\nFurthermore, the departments of Small Business Development and Trade, Industry and Competition are supporting SMMEs to access larger domestic and international markets.\nThese efforts are supported by robust manufacturing support programmes.\nIn the SoNA last year, I said that our vision for industrialisation is underpinned by sector master plans to rejuvenate and grow key industries.\nFour master plans that have been completed and signed to date – which are part of the social compact between labour, business, government and communities – have already had an impact in their respective industries.\nThrough the implementation of the Poultry Master Plan, the industry has invested R800 million to upgrade production.\nSouth Africa now produces an additional one million chickens every week.\nThe Sugar Master Plan was signed during the lockdown, with a commitment from large users of sugar to procure at least 80% of their sugar needs from local growers.\nThrough the implementation of the plan, last year saw a rise in local production and a decline in imported sugar, creating stability for an industry which employs some 85 000 workers.\nSupport for black small-scale farmers is being stepped up, with a large beverage producer committing to expand their procurement sharply.\nSince the signing of the Clothing, Textile, Footwear and Leather Masterplan in November 2019, the industry has invested more than half a billion rand to expand local manufacturing facilities, including SMMEs.\nWe have worked closely with the auto sector to help it weather the pandemic.\nBy the end of the year, the sector had recovered around 70% of its normal annual production, in difficult circumstances.\nLast week, the Ford Motor Company announced a R16 billion investment to expand their manufacturing facility in Tshwane for the next generation Ford Ranger bakkie.\nThis investment will support the growth of around 12 small and medium enterprises in automotive component manufacturing.\nNearly half of the procurement spend on construction of the bulk earthworks and top structure at the Tshwane Special Economic Zone during this phase is expected to be allocated for SMMEs, an amount equal to R1,7 billion in procurement opportunities.\nToyota has invested in its KwaZulu-Natal facility to start production of the first generation of hybrid electric vehicles to come off a South African assembly line.\nThis follows investment announcements by Nissan, Mercedes Benz and Isuzu in expanded production facilities, all of which cement South Africa’s position as a global player in auto manufacturing.\nThis year, our focus will be on getting the industry back to full production, implementing the Black Industrialist Fund and working on a new platform for expanded auto trade with the rest of the continent.\nThis will be part of our concerted effort to boost the manufacturing sector.\nThis year, we will begin to harness the opportunities presented by the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which came into operation on 1 January, following the adoption of the Johannesburg Declaration by the AU.\nThe AfCFTA provides a platform for South African businesses to expand into markets across the continent, and for South Africa to position itself as a gateway to the continent.\nTo address the deep inequalities in our society, we must accelerate the implementation of broad-based black economic empowerment policies on ownership, control and management of the economy.\nLast year, government agreed to landmark deals with companies that will advance black economic empowerment by transferring ownership to their workers.\nIn November last year, we held our third South Africa Investment Conference to review the implementation of previous commitments and to generate new investment into our economy.\nEven under difficult economic circumstances, the investment conference managed to raise some R108 billion in additional investment commitments.\nTogether with investment confirmed from the two previous conferences, we have now received R773 billion in investment commitments towards our five-year target of R1,2 trillion.\nFirms have reported that some R183 billion of these investments has already flowed into projects that benefit the South African economy.\nThis shows that our country is still an attractive investment destination for both local and offshore companies.\nWe have worked to facilitate investment by increasing the ease of doing business, including making it easier to start a business.\nIn the past year, more than 125 000 new companies were registered through the BizPortal platform, completing their registration in just a matter of hours from the comfort of their homes or offices.\nWe are making it easier for business to do business.\nOur third priority intervention is an employment stimulus to create jobs and support livelihoods.\nThe largest numbers of jobs will be created by the private sector in a number of industries as the economy recovers.\nWe continue to work in a social compact with the private sector to create a more conducive environment for them to be able to create jobs.\nOur compact with the private sector is underpinned by a clear commitment to grow our economy and to create jobs.\nHowever, the public sector has a responsibility to stimulate job creation; both through its policies and through direct job creation opportunities.\nThe Presidential Employment Stimulus is one of the most significant expansions of public and social employment in South Africa’s history.\nBy the end of January 2021, over 430 000 opportunities were already supported through the stimulus.\nA further 180 000 opportunities are currently in the recruitment process.\nThese opportunities are in areas like education, arts and culture, global business services, early childhood development (ECD), and small-scale and subsistence farming.\nIt involves environmental programmes such as the clearing of alien trees, wetland rehabilitation, fire prevention, and cleaning and greening across all municipalities.\nThese programmes are about real lives and real livelihoods.\nNearly half a million people are now receiving an income, developing new skills and contributing to their community and the country’s economy.\nWe will continue to support employment for as long as it is necessary while the labour market recovers, even as we work to promote stronger and more resilient growth in the private sector.\nIn the SoNA last year, in response to the huge challenge our country faces of youth unemployment, I announced that the National Youth Development Agency and the Department of Small Business Development would provide grant funding and business support to 1 000 young entrepreneurs within 100 days.\nWhile the programme had to be put on hold due to the coronavirus restrictions, it nevertheless managed to reach its target of 1 000 businesses by International Youth Day on 12 August 2020.\nThis provides a firm foundation for our efforts to support 15 000 start-ups by 2024.\nLast year, we said we would establish the National Pathway Management Network to provide support and opportunities to young people across the country.\nI want to encourage every young South African to join the more than 1,2 million people who are already in the network, and take their next steps to a better future.\nOf the many hardships our people had to experience last year, schooling disruption placed a huge burden on learners, teachers and families.\nDespite this, they persevered.\nIt is our priority for this year to regain lost time and improve educational outcomes, from the early years through to high school and post-school education and training.\nThe fourth priority intervention of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan is to rapidly expand energy generation capacity.\nRestoring Eskom to operational and financial health and accelerating its restructuring process is central to this objective.\nEskom has been restructured into three separate entities for generation, transmission and distribution.\nThis will lay the foundations for an efficient, modern and competitive energy system.\nEskom is making substantial progress with its intensive maintenance and operational excellence programmes to improve the reliability of its coal fleet.\nWe are working closely with Eskom on proposals to improve its financial position, manage its debt and reduce its dependence on the fiscus.\nThis requires a review of the tariff path to ensure that it reflects all reasonable costs and measures to resolve the problem of municipal debt.\nIn December 2020, government and its social partners signed the historic Eskom Social Compact, which outlines the necessary actions we must take, collectively and as individual constituencies, to meet the country’s energy needs now and into the future.\nOver the last year, we have taken action to urgently and substantially increase generation capacity in addition to what Eskom generates:\n- The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy will soon be announcing the successful bids for 2 000 megawatts (MW) of emergency power.\n- The necessary regulations have been amended and the requirements clarified for municipalities to buy power from independent power producers. Systems are being put in place to support qualifying municipalities.\n- Government will soon be initiating the procurement of an additional 11 800 MW of power from renewable energy, natural gas, battery storage and coal in line with the Integrated Resource Plan 2019.\nDespite this work, Eskom estimates that, without additional capacity, there will be an electricity supply shortfall of between 4 000 and 6 000 MW over the next five years, as old coal-fired power stations reach their end of life.\nAs part of the measures to address this shortfall, we will in the coming weeks issue a request for proposals for 2 600 MW from wind and solar energy as part of Bid Window 5.\nThis will be followed by another bid window in August 2021.\nRecent analysis suggests that easing the licensing requirements for new embedded generation projects could unlock up to 5 000 MW of additional capacity and help to ease the impact of load shedding.\nWe will therefore amend Schedule 2 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 2006 (Act 4 of 2006) within the next three months to increase the licensing threshold for embedded generation.\nThis will include consultation among key stakeholders on the level at which the new threshold should be set and the finalisation of the necessary enabling frameworks.\nEskom has already started work to expedite its commercial and technical processes to allow this additional capacity onto the grid without undue delay.\nAs we mobilise all of the resources at our disposal to support economic recovery, we cannot lose sight of the threat that climate change poses to our environmental health, socioeconomic development and economic growth.\nWe are, therefore, working to fulfil our commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement which include the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\nEskom, our largest greenhouse gas emitter, has committed in principle to net zero emission by 2050 and to increase its renewable capacity.\nEskom will be looking to partner with investors to repurpose and repower part of its coal fleet.\nThis will be done in a way that stimulates investment, local economic activity and local manufacturing, as part of a just transition.\nOur work on climate change will be guided by the Presidential Coordinating Commission on Climate Change, which is meeting for the first time this month.\nThe commission will work on a plan for a just transition to a low-carbon economy and climate resilient society.\nWe will not achieve higher rates of growth and employment if we do not implement structural economic reforms.\nThese reforms are necessary to reduce costs and barriers to entry, increase competition, stimulate new investment and create space for new entrants in the market.\nThis work is being driven through Operation Vulindlela, which involves a team in the National Treasury and the President’s office.\nOperation Vulindlela is focusing on reforms in the electricity, water, telecommunications and transport sectors, as well as reforms to our visa and immigration regime.\nThe completion of digital migration is vital to our ability to effectively harness the enormous opportunities presented by technological change.\nAfter many delays, we will begin the phased switch-off of our analogue television transmitters from next month.\nIt is anticipated that this process, which will be done province-by-province, will be completed by the end of March 2022.\nThe process for the licensing of high-demand spectrum is at an advanced stage.\nWe hope that the ongoing litigation on the licensing matter will provide legal certainty and will not unduly delay the spectrum auction process.\nIn the water sector, we are working through Operation Vulindlela to ensure that water license applications are finalised within the revised timeframe of 90 days; and to revive the Green Drop and Blue Drop programmes to strengthen water quality monitoring.\nWe will finalise and implement the revised Raw Water Pricing Strategy, and accelerate the establishment of a national water resources infrastructure agency.\nOur ability to compete in global markets depends on the efficiency of our ports and rail network.\nWe are repositioning Durban as a hub port for the Southern Hemisphere and developing Ngqura as the container terminal of choice.\nThe rail corridor from Gauteng is being extended to enable the export of vehicles through Port Elizabeth.\nThese are crucial steps to move freight from road to rail and increase the competitiveness of the rail system.\nWork is underway with the relevant departments to reform our visa and immigration regime to attract skills and grow the tourism sector.\nAs international travel starts to recover in the wake of COVID-19, we will undertake a full rollout of eVisas to visitors from China, India, Nigeria, Kenya and 10 other countries.\nThe revised list of critical skills will be published for public comment by the Department of Home Affairs, within one week, to ensure that the final version reflects the skills needed by the economy.\nThe momentum that Operation Vulindlela has already built, and the support that it has received across government, shows that we are serious about reform.\nWe will continue to work relentlessly and without pause to create a more modern, efficient and competitive economy that is more open to all South Africans.\nTo support our reform process, the Presidential State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Council has outlined a clear set of reforms that will enable these vital public companies to fulfil their mandate for growth and development.\nOverarching legislation for state-owned companies will be tabled in Cabinet this financial year and in Parliament in the next the financial year.\nA centralised SOE model is being implemented this financial year, which will ensure a standardised governance, financial management and operational performance framework for all SOEs.\nThe mandates of all SOEs are being re-evaluated to ensure that they are responsive to the country’s needs and the implementation of the National Development Plan.\nIn the midst of the economic damage caused by COVID-19, South Africa’s agricultural sector has performed remarkably well.\nIn 2020, we became the world’s second-largest exporter of citrus, with strong export growth in wine, maize, nuts, deciduous fruit and sugar cane.\nThe favourable weather conditions in 2020 and the beginning of 2021 mean that agriculture is likely to grow in the near term.\nThis provides an opportunity for further public-private partnership in agriculture to promote transformation and ensure sustainable growth.\nIt is an opportunity to accelerate land redistribution through a variety of instruments such as land restitution and expropriation of land in order to boost agricultural output.\nTo date, government has redistributed over five million hectares (ha) of land, totalling around 5 500 farms, to more than 300 000 beneficiaries.\nThis is in addition to the land restitution process, which has benefited over two million land claimants and resulted in the transfer of around 2,7 million ha.\nWe are also pursuing programmes to assist smallholder and emerging farmers with market access, to develop skills across the entire agricultural value chain and increase the number of commercial black farmers.\nDuring the course of the next financial year, we will establish a land and agrarian reform agency to fast-track land reform.\nThe Public Service is at the coalface of government, and lack of professionalism does not just impact service delivery; it also dents public confidence.\nAdvancing honesty, ethics and integrity in the Public Service is critical if we are to build a capable state.\nThrough the National School of Government, we continue to roll out courses and training programmes for government officials from entry level to senior management and the Executive.\nIn October last year, I signed off on ministerial performance agreements with all Ministers, which have now been published online.\nThis will enhance accountability and focused performance by members of the Executive.\nWe remain on course to build a capable and professional civil service that delivers on its mandate and is accountable to the South African people.\nWe are proceeding with our efforts to strengthen the local government infrastructure and accelerate service delivery through the District Development Model.\nThe model brings all three spheres of government to focus on key priorities and implementation of critical high impact projects.\nWorking with both public and private sector partners, government is implementing a range of measures to support municipalities to address inadequate and inconsistent service delivery in areas such water provision, infrastructure build and maintenance.\nWe are focusing on the appointment of properly qualified officials at a local level to ensure effective management and provision of services.\nAs we prepare for local government elections, which are due take place this year, we will need to adjust to the conditions forced upon us by COVID-19 to ensure that the people of this country can determine who represents them at this crucial level of government.\nFellow South Africans,\nCorruption is one of the greatest impediments to the country’s growth and development.\nThe revelations from the Zondo Commission of Inquiry lay bare the extent of state capture and related corruption.\nTestimony at the commission has shown how the criminal justice system was compromised and weakened.\nIt is, therefore, vital that we sustain the momentum of the rebuilding effort that we began three years ago.\nThere has been great progress in turning around law enforcement bodies.\nCritical leadership positions have been filled with capable, experienced and trustworthy professionals.\nThere is improved cooperation and sharing of resources between the respective law enforcement agencies, enabling a more integrated approach to investigations and prosecutions.\nWe have started implementation of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy, which lays the basis for a comprehensive and integrated society-wide response to corruption.\nWe will shortly be appointing members of the National Anti-Corruption Advisory Council, which is a multi-sectoral body that will oversee the initial implementation of the strategy and the establishment of an independent statutory anti-corruption body that reports to Parliament.\nWhen reports started to surface last year about possible fraud and corruption in the procurement of COVID-19-related goods and services, we acted decisively to put a stop to these practices, to investigate all allegations and to act against those responsible.\nWe established a fusion centre, which brings together key law enforcement agencies to share information and resources.\nThe fusion centre has brought many cases to trial and preserved or recovered millions of rands in public funds.\nThe Special Investigating Unit (SIU) was authorised to investigate allegations of unlawful conduct with respect to COVID-19 procurement by all state bodies during the National State of Disaster.\nAs it reported last week, the SIU has finalised investigations into 164 contracts with a total value of R3,5 billion.\nIn a significant advance for transparency and accountability, the Political Party Funding Act, 2018 (Act 6 of 2018) will come into operation on 1 April this year.\nThis will regulate public and private funding of political parties. Among other things, it requires the disclosure of donations to parties and establishes two funds that will enable represented political parties to undertake their programmes.\nCrime and violence continue to undermine people’s sense of safety and security.\nTackling crime is central to the success of our recovery.\nCrimes like cable theft, railway infrastructure vandalism, land invasions, construction site disruptions and attacks on truck drivers hamper economic activity and discourage investment.\nWe have taken steps and will continue to stop these crimes and deal with those responsible in terms of the law.\nTask teams have been set up in a number of provinces to deal with extortion and violence on sites of economic activity.\nWe are also fast-tracking the implementation and capacitation of the Border Management Agency to curb illegal immigration and cross-border crime.\nEnding gender-based violence (GBV) is imperative if we lay claim to being a society rooted in equality and non-sexism.\nWhen I launched the National Strategic Plan on Gender-Based Violence and Femicide (GBVF) in April last year, I made a promise to the women and children of this country that we were going to strengthen the Criminal Justice System to prevent them being traumatised again, and to ensure that perpetrators face justice.\nTo give effect to this, three key pieces of legislation were introduced in Parliament last year to make the criminal justice system more effective in combatting GBV.\nTo ensure that perpetrators are brought to book, we are making progress in reducing the backlog of GBV cases.\nWe continue to provide care and support to survivors of GBV.\nIn the SoNA last year, I said that we would prioritise the economic empowerment of women.\nLast year, Cabinet approved a policy that 40% of public procurement should go to women-owned businesses and entities.\nSeveral departments have started implementing this policy and are making progress.\nLast week, we also launched a groundbreaking private sector-led GBVF Response Fund.\nSeveral South African companies and global philanthropies made pledges to the value of R128 million.\nOver the next three years, government will allocate approximately R12 billion to implement the various components of the National Strategic Plan.\nGBV will only end when everyone takes responsibility for doing so in their homes, in their communities, in their workplaces, in their places of worship and in their schools.\nEqually, we need to give attention to issues affecting children, including improving school-readiness, ECD planning and funding, protection against preventable diseases, policy reform around child welfare and reducing violence against children.\nIn the year ahead, we are also going to forge ahead with efforts to provide greater opportunities for persons with disabilities to participate in the economy and in society in general.\nAs we rebuild our economy in the midst of a pandemic, it is necessary that we continue – within our means – to provide support to those businesses and individuals that continue to be most affected.\nBusinesses in several sectors are still struggling and many families continue to suffer as the job market slowly recovers.\nOver the last few months, we have had ongoing discussions with our social partners in business, labour and community-based organisations, who proposed an extension of some of the social and economic support.\nWe have, therefore, decided to extend the period for the Special COVID-19 Grant of R350 by a further three months.\nThis has proven to be an effective and efficient short-term measure to reduce the immediate impact on the livelihoods of poor South Africans.\nWe have also decided to extend the COVID-19 TERS benefit until 15 March 2021, only for those sectors that have not been able to open and operate.\nThe conditions of this extension and the sectors to be included will be announced after consultations with social partners at the National Economic Development and Labour Council.\nThe National Treasury will work with its partners and stakeholders on improvements to the Loan Guarantee Scheme so that it better addresses the realities of SMMEs and other businesses as they strive to recover.\nWe will work with our social partners to ensure that these and other interventions provide the relief to those who most need it.\nFellow South Africans,\nJust as a harsh fire gives new life to our country’s fynbos, this crisis is an opportunity to build a different, better South Africa.\nRebuilding our country requires a common effort.\nIt requires that all South African take responsibility and play their part.\nLet us work together as government, as business, as labour, as political parties and as all of society to clear away the rubble and lay a new foundation.\nAbove all, let us return this country to the values upon which it was founded.\nOn the day of his release, 31 years ago, Madiba gave his first public address here in Cape Town, where he reminded South Africans that there were difficult days ahead, and that the battle was far from won.\nMadiba said:\n“Now is the time to intensify the Struggle on all fronts.”\n“To relax our efforts now would be a mistake which generations to come will not be able to forgive.”\nIn counting the great cost to our society over the past year, we may be tempted to lose faith.\nBut we can get through this. Because we are a nation of heroes.\nI am referring not to the glorious lineage of Struggle icons, but to the everyday heroes that walk among us, who work hard every day to put food on the table, to keep the company running, and to give support, help and care to our people.\nIt is your resilience that will help this country recover.\nIn addition to the many challenges that beset our people, we have heard that his Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini has not been well in recent days and is admitted to hospital.\nI wish to convey my wishes for the speedy recovery of His Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini ka Bhekuzulu.\nOur thoughts and prayers are with the Royal Household and the Zulu nation at this time.\nIt is our collective wish that Isilo Samabandla Wonke is soon restored to good health.\nAs we prepare for the difficult path ahead, we can draw strength From Maya Angelou’s great poem, Still I rise.\nShe writes:\nOut of the huts of history’s shame\nI rise\nUp from a past that’s rooted in pain\nI rise\nI’m a black ocean, leaping and wide,\nWelling and swelling I bear in the tide.\nLeaving behind nights of terror and fear\nI rise\nInto a daybreak that’s wondrously clear\nI rise\nBringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,\nI am the dream and the hope of the slave.\nI rise I rise I rise.\nPeople of South Africa, it is your country that calls on you to rise.\nLet us march forward together to equality, to growth, to dignity and to recovery.\nMay God bless South Africa and protect her sons and daughters.\nI thank you."}, {"claim": "Marijuana's youth impact sees psychotic disorders such as psychosis and schizophrenia increase by three folds.", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Supported", "justification": "Both answers linked from the only Question set show that psychotic disorders were linked to the use of Marijuana's by youths", "claim_date": "10-2-2021", "speaker": "Chris Kapenga", "original_claim_url": "https://twitter.com/SenatorKapenga/status/1359544843761049605", "fact_checking_article": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210428010948/https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/mar/05/chris-kapanga/yes-marijuana-can-increase-risk-schizophrenia-and-/", "reporting_source": "Twitter", "location_ISO_code": "US", "claim_types": ["Numerical Claim"], "fact_checking_strategies": ["Written Evidence", "Numerical Comparison", "Consultation"], "questions": [{"question": "What evidence is available that cannabis use may be a risk factor for later psychosis?", "answers": [{"answer": "The strongest evidence that cannabis use may be a risk factor for later psychosis comes from a Swedish cohort study which found that heavy cannabis use at age 18 increased the risk of later schizophrenia sixfold", "answer_type": "Extractive", "source_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC135493/", "source_medium": "Web text"}, {"answer": "A tenth of the cannabis users by age 15 in our sample (3/29) developed schizophreniform disorder by age 26 compared with 3% of the remaining cohort (22/730).", "answer_type": "Extractive", "source_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC135493/", "source_medium": "Web text"}]}], "orig_claim": "“The National Academy of Medicine points to a significant correlation between marijuana and psychosis, schizophrenia, and other psychotic disorders, particularly in teenagers where the risk of developing schizophrenia increases three fold.”", "orig_verdict": "True", "fulltext": "The National Academy of Medicine points to a significant correlation between marijuana and psychosis, schizophrenia, and other psychotic disorders, particularly in teenagers where the risk of developing schizophrenia increases three fold."}, {"claim": "Marijuana can increase the risk of schizophrenia and psychotic disorders.", "required_reannotation": true, "label": "Supported", "justification": "Marijuana or cannabis has been linked to psychosis and schizophrenia, with those with a predisposition towards mental illness.

Senator Booker originally introduced the legislation in 2020.\nIn 1920 there were nearly 1 million Black farmers in the United States. Today, due to this history of discrimination, it is estimated that there are less than 50,000 remaining Black farmers.\nThe Justice for Black Farmers Act will enact policies to end discrimination within the USDA, protect remaining Black farmers from losing their land, provide land grants to create a new generation of Black farmers and restore the land base that has been lost, and implement systemic reforms to help family farmers across the United States.\n\"Overtly discriminatory and unjust federal policy has robbed Black families in the United States of the ability to build and pass on intergenerational wealth,” said Senator Booker. “When it comes to farming and agriculture, we know that there is a direct connection between discriminatory policies within the USDA and the enormous land loss we have seen among Black farmers over the past century. The Justice for Black Farmers Act will address and correct USDA discrimination and take bold steps to forgive debt and restore the land that has been lost in order to empower a new generation of Black farmers to succeed and thrive. As a new member on the Agriculture committee, I am proud to re-introduce this landmark legislation alongside my colleagues as we work to correct this historic injustice.”\n“For decades, racist policies have robbed Black farmers of the economic opportunity to thrive in our country's agricultural industry. I'm glad to cosponsor Senator Booker's bill, which goes a long way toward restoring and protecting property rights of Black farmers, rooting out discriminatory policies, and providing Black farmers with the necessary tools to succeed,” said Senator Warren.\n“Black farmers and ranchers have been historically excluded in agricultural industries. Inequities in federal policies have stripped them of their land and denied them federal aid. It is not only our responsibility to investigate this systemic discrimination, but we must end and correct it, so that the next generation of Black farmers can grow – especially as we help farmers across the country recover from the economic crisis,” said Senator Gillibrand, member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. “The Justice for Black Farmers Act will put an end to discriminatory practices that have harmed Black agricultural producers for more than a hundred years. I thank Senator Booker for his leadership on this issue and I’m proud to cosponsor this legislation to make farming more equitable and inclusive.”\n“We have to acknowledge that the USDA has a history of institutionalized discrimination against Black farmers and farmers of color. That is the history we cannot look away from,” said Senator Smith. “At a recent Senate Agriculture Committee hearing, I brought up the need to create equitable credit access for diverse farmers—including the Black, Hmong, Latino and Native American farmers in my state of Minnesota—because these are the types things we need to be working to address. This historic legislation is needed so we can help create a future that empowers more farmers to succeed.”\n“The Justice for Black Farmers Act is essential legislation that will help level the playing field for Black farmers in Georgia and across our nation who for too long have been denied the true promise of the American Dream. While we work on getting immediate relief to farmers of color to help them move behind this current health and economic crisis, I look forward to fighting alongside Senator Booker to get this bill passed and signed into law,” said Senator Reverend Warnock.\n“The Justice for Black Farmers Act is the most ambitious legislative proposal ever developed to address historic and ongoing discrimination against Black farmers,” said John Boyd, Founder and President of the National Black Farmers Association (NBFA). “As NBFA and the Environmental Working Group recently documented, Black farmers have been systemically denied access to land, subsidies, loans and other critical tools through government and private discrimination, and the institutional racism that has driven Black land loss is being reinforced through the USDA’s broken policies. By providing new access to land and credit and providing debt relief, the Justice for Black Farmers Act will help right these historic wrongs. By providing new oversight and accountability within the USDA, the Justice for Black Farmers Act will help address the roots of the USDA’s racist history. By making an unprecedented investment in training through historically Black colleges and universities and groups like the National Black Farmers Association, the Justice for Black Farmers Act will ensure that Black farmers have the tools they need to succeed. These reforms are long overdue. We applaud the leadership of Sens. Booker, Warren, Gillibrand, Warnock and Smith, and we urge Congress to act swiftly to address USDA’s long history of discrimination against Black Farmers.”\n\"The Justice For Black Farmers Act is an incredibly important step towards addressing the harm that Black farmers and land stewards have suffered and continue to endure,” said Dara Cooper, Executive Director of the National Black Food and Justice Alliance. “This is one very important opportunity towards addressing the state of emergency that Black farmers and land stewards continue to face. Considering Black farming communities have been reduced by an alarming 98%, we are sounding the alarm that it is long past due to address the unfinished business that farmer activists have been calling for quite some time. Let us all rally behind this important piece of legislation and make sure it passes. It is the least we can do for Black farmers and our failing food system.\"\nSpecifically, the Justice for Black Farmers Act will:\nThe full text of the bill can be viewed here.

Some of the legal victories took place in states like Colorado and Iowa where the popular vote counts for the respective winners of those states –Biden in Colorado and Trump in Iowa— were not close.\nOf the 22 cases that have been heard by the courts and decided on their merits, Trump and Republicans have prevailed in 15, according to citizen journalist John Droz Jr., a physicist and environmental advocate in Morehead City, N.C.\nDroz thus reports that Trump has won two-thirds of the cases fully adjudicated by the courts.\nThree of the 15 cases whose rulings were favorable to Trump were filed on or after election day, Nov. 3.\nDroz and a team of volunteers dug through court filings and legal minutiae to track down 81 lawsuits that were filed in connection with the Nov. 3, 2020 presidential election. The lawsuits were tracked on Droz’s publicly available spreadsheet that was current as of Feb. 6.\nUnfortunately, Droz’s report gets some technicalities wrong.\nFor instance, in Republican Party of PA v. Boockvar, Et Al., 20A84 (US Supreme Court) Justice Samuel Alito issued an injunction that was favorable to the Trump campaign against the counting of mail-in and absentee ballots where voters were allowed to provide proof of identity days after Election Day.. However, the case has not been heard yet, and so it is inaccurate to say, as the report does, that the case was “decided on the merits” and is “closed.”\nOf the 81 cases, 11 were withdrawn or consolidated and 23 were dismissed for lack of standing or on other grounds. Both the cohort of 11 and of 23 should not be considered “wins or losses for either side,” Droz says, because they “have nothing to do with the merits of the case.”\nThis leaves 47 cases. Of those 47, Droz reports 22 have been finalized after the court heard arguments, considered evidence, and then issued a ruling.\nOf those 22, Trump or Republicans won 15 and lost 7, according to the analysis.\nThis leaves 25 lawsuits that have yet to be finally disposed of.\nThis means Trump and Republicans “have WON the majority of 2020 election cases fully heard, and then decided on the merits!” Droz said in a statement. “Is that what the mainstream media is reporting?”\nAmong the legal victories for Republicans were:\nRNC v. Miller, in the Iowa courts, a lawsuit in which the Republican National Committee won an injunction over absentee ballot applications.\nRNC v. Gill, in the Iowa courts, in which the Trump campaign won an injunction preventing a county official from distributing and accepting signed forms containing preprinted information.\nDroz noted that only three lawsuits addressed voting machine inaccuracies.\n“One of these was dismissed (due to jurisdiction), one was ruled against (although no discovery was granted), and one is still open (discovery was granted).”\n“The likely explanation for so few cases in these two areas is that legally proving fraud or voting machine manipulations are very time-consuming processes, that require substantial investigative work and documentation. There simply wasn’t enough time to do this prior to key points in the process (like the Electoral College).”\n“Our view is that the public needs to be much better educated regarding the election integrity issue—and having a more accurate understanding of the lawsuit component is a key part of that,” Droz wrote, explaining the purpose of his report.\nCorrection: the headline on this article was updated at 10:28 a.m. on Feb. 9, 2021.\nCorrection: the article was revised to mention possible technical problems with Droz’s report at 1:07 p.m. on Feb. 10, 2021."}, {"claim": "South Africa has halted the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine.", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Supported", "justification": "yes, south africa has halted the use of astrazeneca due to effectiveness.

This is what online translators translate 'Ipsos mori' to, but in reality it is garbled ungrammatical Latin. Ipsos MORI says its name was created from the merger of two companies and doesn’t mean anything.\nWhat was claimed\nYou are going to die if you get tested for Covid-19.\nOur verdict\nThis is false. There are no reports of anyone dying because of a Covid-19 test. It is important to get tested if you have symptoms.\nA number of posts on social media claim that the name of market research company Ipsos MORI translates to ‘they die’ in Latin. A TikTok video being shared widely on Whatsapp warns people this means they will die if they get a Covid-19 test. Other claims on Facebook also warn about the company name.\nOnline translators do say that Ipsos MORI translates to ‘they die’ in English (although in fact the literal translation is more garbled and not grammatically correct).\nOn its website, Ipsos MORI says its name “doesn’t mean anything” and was formed in 2005 by the merger of Ipsos—a company founded in France in 1975 which took its name from the Latin phrase ‘ipso facto’ (meaning ‘by that very fact’)—and Market and Opinion Research International (MORI), which was founded in the UK in 1969.\nIpsos MORI has been working for the Department for Health and Social Care, along with Imperial College London, on a home testing programme to track levels of Covid-19 infection in the community, including among people who do not have symptoms. Participants were randomly selected and asked to take a Covid-19 test, but taking part is voluntary.\nHundreds of thousands of people have been tested as part of the programme, and so far seven reports detailing the results have been published. Each of the three reports published in October, November and December alone included results from hundreds of thousands of volunteers in England.\nBetween 13 November and 3 December, over 160,000 volunteers were tested as part of the research. But in the whole of November, just under 48,000 deaths were registered in England, and under 53,000 in December. If taking a test and taking part in this research killed you, we would expect the death toll to be considerably higher than this.\nMore than 71.5 million Covid-19 tests have been conducted across the UK since the pandemic began. There are no reports of tests causing death. If you experience Covid-19 symptoms, or are asked to take a test by a health professional or NHS Test and Trace, you should do so.\nThis article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here.\nFor the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as missing context\nbecause Ipsos MORI’s name does not derive from the Latin for “they die” and people will not die from taking part in Ipsos MORI’s Covid-19 testing research.\nYou’ve probably seen a surge in misleading and unsubstantiated medical advice since the Covid-19 outbreak. If followed, it can put lives at serious risk. We need your help to protect us all from false and harmful information.\nWe’ve seen people claiming to be health professionals, family members, and even the government – offering dangerous tips like drinking warm water or gargling to prevent infection. Neither of these will work.\nThe longer claims like these go unchecked, the more they are repeated and believed. It can put people’s health at serious risk, when our services are already under pressure.\nToday, you have the opportunity to help save lives. Good information about Covid-19 could be the difference between someone taking the right precautions to protect themselves and their families, or not. Could you help protect us all from false and harmful information today?"}, {"claim": "“We know mask mandates work.

Tom Cotton, R-Ark., arguing against President Joe Biden’s immigration agenda, claimed that there’s no screening process for people coming into the United States.\nWhile millions of Americans are out of work, Cotton said in a Feb. 1 Fox News interview, Biden wants to give \"amnesty to 15 million\" people living illegally in the country, invite more guest workers, and give people \"with bogus claims of asylum\" an opportunity to come into the country to work.\n\"And we are in a pandemic, good job,\" Fox & Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade responded sarcastically.\nCotton continued: \"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\" He praised former President Donald Trump’s \"Remain in Mexico\" policy to keep asylum seekers in Mexico, \"as opposed to being released into our country\" pending a hearing.\nDuring his presidential campaign, Biden promised a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million people illegally in the country, and spoke out against the Remain in Mexico program, saying he would allow people seeking asylum to stay in the U.S. while their cases were under review. Biden’s administration stopped enrolling people in the program, but has not revoked it.\nWe asked Cotton’s press office for more information about his claim that there’s \"no way to screen\" migrants.\n\"Relying on the honor system for security and health background checks is not a sufficient screen,\" said Caroline Tabler, a spokesperson for Cotton.\nBut U.S. officials don’t have to rely on an \"honor system.\" U.S. Customs and Border Protection has tools and processes to screen immigrants who are apprehended at the border for health and security issues, even if the people aren’t fully upfront or don’t have medical records or documentation on hand proving they have a clean background.\nCBP told PolitiFact that it does initial inspections for symptoms or risk factors associated with COVID-19, and \"pursuant to longstanding infectious disease protocols,\" refers immigrants who might have an infectious disease to local clinics or hospitals \"for appropriate medical evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment.\"\nProcedures for COVID-19 have been in place since the beginning of the pandemic, said Matthew Dyman, a spokesperson for the CBP.\nIn late April, CBP said that a 31-year-old Indian man was the first person in its custody to test positive for COVID-19.\nThe oversight office within the Department of Homeland Security surveyed CBP personnel from April 22 to May 1. Ninety percent of the Border Patrol stations and ports of entry offices that responded to the survey said they conducted risk assessments to determine if people in CBP custody were exposed to COVID-19.\nProtocols included \"screening individuals for COVID-19 symptoms when they are initially processed at a facility, and continued monitoring for potential COVID-19 symptoms for as long as they remain in CBP custody,\" said the September 2020 inspector general report. The report said, however, that it was rare for facilities to be able to administer COVID-19 tests on site.\nFeatured Fact-check\nAs of July 13, 58 migrants across all Border Patrol stations had tested positive for COVID-19, the report said.\nCBP in late 2019 issued a directive to improve the medical screening of people in its custody after several children died while in CBP care. The three-phase approach called forCBP personnel to observe people for potential medical issues, conduct health interviews on all people under 18 years old, \"at a minimim\"; and \"subject to availability of resources and operational requirements,\" perform a medical assessment on children age 12 and younger and people with a known or reported medical concern. Implementation of the directive was contingent upon funding and resources, the CBP acting commissioner said in 2019.\nWhether CBP’s health screening procedures are sufficient and effective can be debated, but it’s inaccurate to say there’s \"no way to screen\" people.\nThe Texas Tribune and ProPublica reported in August that a different immigration agency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was testing unaccompanied children for COVID-19 and deporting those who tested negative. The news organizations said that ICE had agreements with 10 countries requiring that children test negative for COVID-19 before being sent back to their home countries. The Washington Post reported in early December that 1,061 minors in U.S. immigration custody had tested positive for COVID-19 since March.\nIn March 2020, the Trump administration invoked Title 42, a section of federal law that allows the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to deny entry to immigrants coming from countries with infectious disease outbreaks. So far, Biden’s administration has kept that directive, allowing quick expulsion of people arriving at the border.\nCBP has access to international databases through TECS, an information-sharing platform that allows the agency to obtain the criminal history of a person who attempts to enter the United States, said Nicole Hallett, an associate clinical professor of law and director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School.\nA 2016 DHS report said that the purpose of TECS was \"to track individuals who have violated or are suspected of violating a law or regulation that is enforced or administered by CBP, to provide a record of any inspections conducted at the border by CBP, to determine admissibility into the United States, and to record information regarding individuals, firms, and organizations to whom DHS/CBP has issued detentions and warnings.\"\nCBP statistics on the number of \"criminal aliens\" identified at the border prove that CBP regularly identifies individuals with criminal histories before they enter the United States, Hallett said.\nIf a person poses a threat to national security, they can’t get asylum, said Lynn Marcus, director of the Community Immigration Law Placement Clinic at the University of Arizona. \"There is a process for screening all of this,\" she said.\nCotton said, \"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or security.\"\nA CBP database allows personnel to run criminal background checks on people apprehended at the border and access records collected by U.S. and foreign authorities. CBP routinely publishes data on immigrants who attempted to enter the country and have a criminal record.\nCBP might not always have access to a person’s full medical records, but the agency says it screens people for COVID-19 and other health issues.\nIt’s fair to question whether existing protocols are sufficient, but it’s inaccurate to say \"we have no way to screen\" immigrants.\nWe rate Cotton’s claim False.\nOur Sources\nTwitter, @SenTomCotton tweet, Feb. 1, 2021\nEmail interview, Caroline Tabber, Sen.

Jim Justice (R-WV) Says, State Has Completed Vaccinations at All Nursing Homes and Assisted Living Centers; Florida's Vaccine Rollout Frustrates Residents. Aired 10-10:30a ET\nAired February 1, 2021 - 10:00 ET\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n[10:00:00]\nPOPPY HARLOW, CNN NEWSROOM: Top of the hour this Monday morning. Glad you're with us, I'm Poppy Harlow.\nJIM SCIUTTO, CNN NEWSROOM: And I'm Jim Sciutto.\nWashington takes on the health and economic crisis at the same time, Congress preparing to make a last-ditch effort at a bipartisan COVID relief plan. Ten Senate Republicans will meet with President Biden this afternoon to share their alternatives to his $1.9 trillion stimulus plan. The trouble is theirs is valued less an than a third of that, also excludes the state and local aid that Democrats find essential to responding to this. That said, they are meeting this afternoon. We'll see where that goes.\nAnd in the fight against the virus, some better news this morning. For the first in almost two months, fewer than 100,000 Americans are hospitalized with COVID-19. The direction of the graph there perhaps a hopeful sign.\nHARLOW: Yes, it really is. The fight far from over, as you can see, the last month marked the deadliest of the pandemic in the U.S. More than 95,000 people in this country died from COVID in that month alone.\nThe key to ending the pandemic is vaccinating people, mass vaccination. Some states using big sites to get as many shots in arms as quickly as they possibly can.\nWe kick things off in Washington on the fight for aid, for stimulus. Our Lauren Fox joins us on Capitol Hill.\nOkay, so the Republicans came out with a counterproposal and Joe Biden said, come on over to the White House. But what he does with that is the big question.\nLAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well that is exactly right, Poppy. We're getting more details this morning on what this Republican plan would include. We now know it is $618 billion in stimulus funding. We do know that it does not include money for direct funding for state and local governments. It does, however, include about $20 billion for schools, $20 billion for childcare, $220 billion in an effort to ensure that the Americans have expanded unemployment benefits. It also includes $50 billion for small businesses, $160 billion for testing, tracing and other coronavirus-related supplies.\nSo it is a start. It is a down payment. But it is far, like you said, from the Democratic proposal, which sits right now at $1.9 trillion.\nLook, we expected the Democrats could move as soon as this week to unlock a budget proposal and a budget policy plan that would allow them to pass a coronavirus relief bill with just a simple Democratic majority. We still are going to wait and see what this meeting brings tonight and whether it changes the Democrats' calculus moving forward.\nBut we are getting some early signs from Majority Leader Chuck Schumer that this bill is just a little too small and too late.\nSCIUTTO: Yes. And Senator Van Hollen telling me last hour that they're doing this kind of two tracks, right? Keep the reconciliation path open while still negotiating.\nJohn, you look at where this stands and I wonder where you see the overlap in the negotiation here. It strikes that me no state and local funding is a non-starter for the Democrats and the president. The price tag too, this is 600 versus $1.9 trillion. Where could there be a meeting of the minds.\nJOHN HARWOOD, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: I think it's very unlikely there will be a meeting of the minds by proposing something one-third of the size of what President Biden has proposed and by proposing zero for state and local governments knowing that that is a top priority for the Democrats and for the new administration. That tells me that this is more of a gesture than a serious offer intended to come up with a deal.\nObviously, the Biden administration has signaled that they're willing to make some trims to their plan. For example, what the Republicans have proposed on curtailing the checks, targeting the checks, that might be acceptable to the administration. But that only cuts a couple of hundred billion dollars off the proposal. So, say, that would take you from $1.9 trillion to $1.7 trillion. What about everything else? It means they've slashed everything else.\nAnd so you've got in the Biden proposal expansion of the child tax credit, expansion in the earned income tax credit, a lot of money for childcare, money for eviction protections, all sorts of things that the Biden administration wants to push forward quickly. They feel like there is a lot of pent up demand among Democrats to act and put some more money into the economy, more relief into the checkbooks of Americans.\nAnd I think you mentioned that there are two tracks. Chris Van Hollen said there are two tracks. One of the tracks is a lot more robust than the other and that is the reconciliation that Democrats only track.\nHARLOW: Thank you, John, for the reporting at the White House, Lauren, thank you for that on the Hill.\n[10:05:02]\nLet's go to the massive nor'easter that is hitting a number of states this morning, expected to drop a few feet of snow in some places, crippling some COVID vaccination efforts, testing centers shutting down in some states, vaccine locations closing temporarily, including a mega site in New Jersey.\nSCIUTTO: Chad Myers tracking the timing and scope of the storms. So we got a few inches here in Washington, New York getting a lot worse. Tell us what you're seeing out there.\nCHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: For D.C., you're just about done. I think maybe another inch or two will be possible as the storm swings on by but not much. The storm is winding up for New York City, for Boston, for Connecticut and all the way across parts of New Jersey. There is the radar right now really getting some bright banding here across parts of New York City and the like and an extreme event for power outages, for, really, critical infrastructure problems, and, of course, trying to drive around or even get a city bus.\nHere is the morning hours right now where we're seeing the snow. The low continues to develop south of Long Island. It is not even as strong as it will be yet. We're still ramping this up. It is in very warm water, the Gulf Stream water. Now, this isn't hurricane water but it's very warm out there. 50s out there, that's enough for the storm to gather more strength and then it starts to throw that snow up into the colder air here.\nBoston will change over to a sleet mix. We have a lot of sleet in Philadelphia in the morning hours already. But by tomorrow, especially by 5:00, it begins to pull away but hours and hours and hours of snow. So at least a foot-and-a-half in New York City, less in Boston, and I'll get to that in a second, because it ramps across the city. But there will be spots west of New York City, two feet or maybe three.\nNow, let's hope one of these bull's eyes is not over Manhattan's, not out of the question. That's just now the forecast. And look at Boston. You go from along the harbor at maybe two to three inches back toward Worcester at over 18. So, yes, I said 6 to 12 for Boston but that is downtown. You get away from into the suburbs, a lot more. Guys, back to you.\nSCIUTTO: It is Worcester, by the way, Chad Myers, just to keep it local. Thanks very much.\nHow is the storm impacting mass vaccination sites like the one just opening in Boston's famous Fenway Park?\nHARLOW: Let's get to Alexandra Field. She joins us inside of Fenway Park with more.\nI mean, it looks like a lot of folks still there.\nALEXANDRA FIELD, CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Look, snow doesn't get in the way of a lot here in Boston and for now, there are absolutely no plans to shut down this vaccination site. They did encourage people who had appointments in the afternoon to come a bit earlier, and come they did.\nYou can see there is a long line. That's because every vaccine is spoken (ph) for. They opened up their registration for vaccines for the public here at Fenway for the first time last week, all of the appointments filled up within a matter of hours, they'll be releasing new appointments every week. They expect those to book up again in a matter of hours.\nThey say this is the first mass vaccination site in the city of Boston. It will serve an urban and a diverse population. They believe that concentrating the supplies and the resources in a site like this is an effective way to do it and the numbers seem to bearing that out. They'll start about 500 vaccinations today, and next week, they'll ramp up to doing about a thousand people a day, 1,250 beyond.\nBut what happens when it comes time to play baseball. We asked the CEO and president of the Red Sox and here is his hope.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nSAM KENNEDY, PRESIDENT AND CEO, BOSTON RED SOX: Hopefully, we'll do both. We'll see what the state and city tell us. If they would like us to keep going, we're happy to do that and work it around the baseball schedule. I mean, it's just so important. We obviously play at night and then we have early morning shifts. We'll figure it out. It is just too important. We have got to get everybody vaccinated.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nFIELD: Vaccine in the morning, baseball at night, a whole new kind of ball game. The city said or rather health officials believe that this site would be effective because they say they're having a lot of success with the site at Gillette Stadium that's been open since January. Jim and Poppy?\nHARLOW: Wishing them a ton of success, that makes such a difference. Alexandra Field, great to have you there, thank you very much.\nWell, West Virginia, if you haven't heard, now you know, has become a national leader in the vaccine rollout process. How did they do it and how can other states model and replicate the blueprint of their success. We'll talk to the state's governor. It is great.\nSCIUTTO: It's a hopeful model. Maybe there are lessons to be shared.\nPlus, CNN learned overnight the former president, Donald Trump's new political action committee took in more than $30 million in the final weeks of 2020. Ahead, what these fundraising numbers it might mean for the future of the Republican Party. Of course, most of it based on the lie, that the election was stolen.\nAnd FBI agents are reportedly calling the investigation into the deadly Capitol Hill riot, their biggest case since the September 11th attacks. We're going to have new details.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n[10:10:10]\nHARLOW: Welcome back. Well, this morning, as most states across the country are facing a bumpy, often frustrating vaccine rollout, we are seeing a real vaccination success story across West Virginia. The state very early on deployed its National Guard to help with logistics and decided not to follow the Trump administration's plan to use chain pharmacies for the mass vaccination and vaccinating nursing homes first.\nIt is a different approach. It's been successful for them. They have taken the route of using small local pharmacies instead.\n[10:15:02]\nWest Virginia's governor, Jim Justice, announcing over the weekend the state has now given doses to all willing individuals at nursing homes and assisted living centers and he joins me now. Good morning, Governor, thank you for being here.\nGOV. JIM JUSTICE (R-WV): Thank you for having me, Poppy. Thank you.\nHARLOW: It is such a success story and so many folks on the ground there leading this effort deserve a lot of praise. You've got 94.23 percent of your vaccination doses out there that you've received and no state has given a larger share of its residents the second dose of vaccine. West Virginia has led on that front as well.\nYou have said this is practical smarts, not rocket science. Why have you been able to do this when so many others haven't?\nJUSTICE: Well, Poppy, I have got to tell you a story real quick with my dad. When I was skinny and had brown hair, I was probably 18 or 19 years old, I was standing in front of his desk one day, and I said, dad, is there anything I could do? And dad played a little bit of football at Perdue and he was a big chested guy and everything, about that time the desk exploded as he grabbed me around my shirt and literally slammed me down on the desk and said, damn you, there is always something you can do and you better damn well always remember that.\nWell I have and I lived my life that way. And it is a virtue and a curse at the same because I won't give up. But in West Virginia, that is what we did. We looked at this, instead of trying to create a bureaucratic model of to get this administered and get going, we got going. And we knew that it was all about age, age and age and we knew that, absolutely, our elderly, especially those people want to go to their local pharmacies and they want to go to the local health clinics and everything. And so we dispersed the National Guard and we just got after it.\nAnd just imagine that today, and this is hard to believe, but we have put on first round shots of the vaccines that we've received, we're now at 108.1 percent of the vaccines received that we've put in arms, meaning that we've got more vaccines out of the vials and absolutely not throwing a single one away.\nI mean, West Virginia is a small state but it bounds with a lot of good and smart people and we've been missed in a lot of ways but it is really going on here and going on good.\nHARLOW: I don't think you're going to be missed anymore after this. I mean, this is critically important.\nYou've had a message to other governors who have really struggled and that is stop playing the same play, another football analogy, stop running the same play. Are they calling you now, those governors?\nJUSTICE: Well, I'm sure they're reaching out to a lot of different people. I've not had any governors call directly to me. But from the standpoint -- everybody wants to be a shining star and think they've got this figured out. I mean, for crying out loud, Poppy, it doesn't matter if it is an American in West Virginia or Nebraska or Texas or wherever it may be, if we've got vaccines that are sitting in a warehouse shelf, I mean, they need to be in somebody's arms.\nWe need to realize as a nation that this stuff happening by the hour, not by the month and people are dying. And we need to all come together and quit fighting with one another.\nHARLOW: That is true. And I know none of your doses have sat on shelves there for more than a week.\nThere -- you have taken though, I just want to get your response to this, some heat about teachers. And you've taken some heat from some of your state saying you're not prioritizing teachers, what happened on Friday was a move to take them down. Can you respond to that down on the list, can you respond to that and you could guarantee that teachers are among the essential workers you're deeming to get the vaccine now across the board for teachers?\nJUSTICE: Well, without any question, we have made the teachers the essential from the very get-go. And, Poppy, there is no truth to that, whatsoever. I mean, what we did was just this, in fact, we decided that we needed to go back to school from eighth grade down because we can't do anything but follow the science and follow the medical communities and they're saying that that is perfectly safe and we should be doing that and everything.\nBut in addition to that, we decided we were going to get all of the teachers and all of the service personnel, all of them, 50 years of age and older, all of them vaccinated.\nAnd so we've been on that campaign. And what we're going to do, as soon as we get some vaccines, as soon as we get more vaccines, we'll double back and get the rest of the teachers and everything. But our teachers are doing great and I hope and pray that we'll keep our kids in school.\nHARLOW: Okay. Well, that is a promise to those teachers. So I'm sure they're glad to hear that.\nLet me switch gears here because economic relief is critical for Americans right now.\n[10:20:01]\nIt's critical to your folks in West Virginia. You have been clear about your desire to support President Biden, to work across the aisle. When it comes to this COVID relief bill, I wonder what is more important to the people of West Virginia and to you, that Biden's $1.9 trillion bill passes even if it is without Republican support and reconciliation, which would mean bigger checks to your folks in need, or that it is a bipartisan agreement even if it is less money?\nJUSTICE: Well, first and foremost, I wish we would all come together, and that is not just blowing smoke. I mean, that's just -- because I don't do that. But the other flip side of this is, Poppy, we've got a lot of people in West Virginia that are still struggling with paying their power bill because they got laid off because this pandemic just stripped their job away from them.\nHARLOW: Right, so which one is it?\nJUSTICE: I mean, at the end of the day, really and truly, Poppy, what we need to do is we need to -- we need to understand that trying to be per se fiscally responsible at this point in time with what we've got going on in this country, if we actually throw away some money right now, so what? We have really got to move and get people taken care of and get people back on balance.\nAnd I want to work with the Biden administration just like I worked are with the Trump administration and I want to move forward.\nHARLOW: That is really significant to hear from a Republican like yourself in a state where your Democratic senator, Joe Manchin, thinks these payments are not targeted enough. Have you talked to him about it?\nJUSTICE: Well, you know, I have not talked directly to Joe about that and everything. I don't really -- you know, I don't really know exactly what the thinking could possibly be there. I mean, we have got people that are really hurting. I mean, that is just understood.\nAnd on top of that, I mean, here is a perfect example, Poppy. My executive assistant came in the other day and said, not far from my home, there was an elderly man that froze to death in his house and everything, probably couldn't afford to pay the power bill. I mean, there is so many different things where people are really, really hurting. And today we've got to move. We can't hold back. We've got to move.\nHARLOW: That is a clear message on stimulus. But for that man, I mean, aren't there powers that you have to not allow them to be turning off the heat on your folks right now?\nJUSTICE: Well I -- HARLOW: That is a tragic story.\nJUSTICE: Yes, I do not know exactly -- I don't know the details of what happened there at all. And, you know, and, again, our utility companies here are doing a great job and they're not turning off the heat on people and everything but I don't know what happened. But there is too much pain. I mean, there is too much pain going on right now. And we just got to adjust that and then let America take off again.\nHARLOW: West Virginia Governor Jim Justice, again, congratulations on your efforts on vaccination and thank you for joining us this morning.\nJUSTICE: Poppy, thank you so much. Thank you, now.\nHARLOW: We'll be right back.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n[10:25:00]\nHARLOW: We just told you a success story about vaccine rollouts in West Virginia, but Florida's vaccine rollout has been plagued with issues. So now the state is trying something new to try to get more people vaccinated.\nSCIUTTO: CNN's Rosa Flores has been covering the story for some time. She has more.\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\nROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Evelyn Aub misses pre- COVID times.\nEVELYN AUB, STRUGGLED TO GET VACCINE APPOINTMENT: I miss people's smiles.\nFLORES: And says her Palm Beach County home is her safe haven, her car is her freedom and the COVID-19 vaccine is hope. And while getting an appointment online was frustrated.\nAUB: I waited and waited and they never said there wasn't room. They always said it's full. Do not leave this page.\nFLORES: Did it try your patience, Evelyn?\nAUB: Yes, it most certainly did.\nFLORES: Her son used multiple devices to get her an appointment at a Publix near her home.\nAUB: I said, what did you? How did you do it?\nFLORES: The vaccine rollout in Florida has been bumpy but Governor DeSantis has been working to fulfill a promise.\nGOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): Our senior population deserves to be the priority.\nFLORES: And so far, more than 1.6 million people have received one or both vaccine doses, including more than 1.2 million seniors 65 and over.\nBut the governor's promise has a blind spot, say some home health workers like Stephanie Hayman MacDonald (ph). She takes care of vulnerable seniors and has to compete with the elderly for the same vaccine slots on the same jammed websites.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's terrible. It's awful.\nFLORES: Stephanie is one of the lucky ones. She got the first dose Friday. In Florida, there are about 80,000 home health workers like her and they are up in arms because while the governor's executive order on vaccines gives health care workers and those over 65 priority, home health workers feel forgotten.\nSHAYNA ADANIEL, DIRECTOR, CLIENT SERVICES FOR BRIGHTSTAR CARE: Home health has just been in this blind spot from the very beginning. It kind of is disheartening that we are having such a struggle.\nFLORES: Governor DeSantis says the answer to getting more people vaccinated is to get more vaccines. And he has been in a fighting match with the Biden White House about it.\nJEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: They've only distributed about 50 percent of the vaccines that they have been given in Florida. So, clearly, they have a good deal of the vaccine.\nDESANTIS: When the person at the White House says that Florida has all these doses, she was -- those are second doses.\n[10:30:04]\nMELISSA MCKINLAY, COMMISSIONER, PALM BEACH COUNTY, FLORIDA: Where has he been.

EST\nTHE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon, folks. I’m going to make some brief remarks, sign an executive order, and then take your questions, if that’s okay with you all.\nLast week, we immediately got to work to contain the pandemic and deliver economic relief to millions of Americans who need it the most. And today we’re getting to work to rebuild the backbone of America: manufacturing, unions, and the middle class.\nIt’s based on a simple premise: that we’ll reward work, not wealth, in this country. And the key plank of ensuring the future will be “Made in America.” I’ve long said that I don’t accept the defeatist view that the forces of automation and globalization can’t keep — can keep union jobs from growing here in America. We can create more of them, not fewer of them.\nI don’t buy for one second the — that the vitality of the American manufacturing is a thing of the past. American manufacturing was the arsenal of democracy in World War Two, and it must be part of the engine of American prosperity now. That means we are going to use taxpayers’ money to rebuild America. We’ll buy American products and support American jobs, union jobs.\nFor example, the federal government every year spends approximately $600 billion in government procurement to keep the country going safe and secure. And there’s a law that’s been on the books for almost a century now: to make sure that that money was spent — taxpayers’ dollars for procurement is spent to support American jobs and American businesses.\nBut the previous administration didn’t take it seriously enough. Federal agencies waived the Buy American requirement without much pushback at all. Big corporations and special interests have long fought for loopholes to redirect American taxpayers’ dollars to foreign companies where the products are being made. The result: tens of billions of American taxpayers’ dollars supporting foreign jobs and foreign industries.\nIn 1918 — excuse me, in 2018 alone, the Department spent $3 billion — the Defense Department — on foreign construction contracts, leaving American steel and iron out in the cold. It spent nearly $300 million in foreign engines and on vehicles instead of buying American vehicles and engines from American companies, putting Americans to work.\nUnder the previous administration, the federal government contract awarded directly to foreign companies went up 30 percent. That is going to change on our watch.\nToday I’m taking the first steps in my larger Build Back Better Recovery Plan that invests in American workers, unions, and businesses up and down the supply chain. And I know that previous presidents entered office by promising to buy America and instituting the Buy American policy, but here’s why this is different and not the same:\nI’ll be signing an executive order in just a moment, tightening the existing Buy American policies, and go further. We’re setting clear directives and clear explanations. We’re going to get to the core issue with a centralized, coordinated effort.\nLook, today I’m creating a director of Made in America at the White House Office of Management and Budget who will oversee our all-of-government Made in America initiative. That starts with stopping federal agencies from waiving Buy American requirements with impunity, as has been going on. If an agency wants to issue a waiver to say “We’re not going to buy an American product as part of this project; we’re going to buy a foreign product,” they have to come to the White House and explain it to us.\nWe’re going to require that waivers be publicly posted; that is, if someone is seeking a waiver to build this particular vehicle or facility and is going to buy the following foreign parts, that waiver — the request for it — is going to be posted. Then we’ll work with small American manufacturers and businesses to give them a shot to raise their hand and say, “Yeah, I can do that here in my shop, in my town.”\nIt’s about — as you’ve heard me say before, I used to have a friend who was a great athlete, who’d say, “You got to know how to know.” These small businesses don’t even know they can compete for making the product that is attempting to be waived and being able to be bought abroad.\nAnd I’m directing the Office of Management and Budget to review waivers to make sure they are only used in very limited circumstances. For example, when there’s an overwhelming national security, humanitarian, or emergency need here in America. This hasn’t happened before. It will happen now.\nHere’s what else we’re going to be doing. Under the Build Back Better Recovery Plan, we’ll invest hundreds of billions of dollars in buying American products and materials to modernize our infrastructure, and our competitive strength will increase in a competitive world. That means millions of good-paying jobs, using American-made steel and technology, to rebuild our roads, our bridges, our ports, and to make them more climate resilient, as well as making them able to move faster and cheaper and cleaner to transport American-made goods across the country and around the world, making us more competitive.\nIt also means replenishing our stockpiles to enhance our national security. As this pandemic has made clear, we can never again be in a position where we have to rely on a foreign country that doesn’t share our interest in order to protect our people during a national emergency. We need to make our own protective equipment, essential products and supplies. And we’ll work with our allies to make sure they have resilient supply chains as well.\nWe’ll also make historic investments in research and development — hundreds of billions of dollars — to sharpen America’s innovative edge in markets where global leadership is up for grabs — markets like battery technology, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, clean energy.\nThe federal government also owns an enormous fleet of vehicles, which we’re going to replace with clean, electric vehicles made right here in America by American workers, creating millions of jobs — a million autoworker jobs in clean energy — and vehicles that are net-zero emissions.\nAnd together, this will be the largest mobilization of public investment in procurement, infrastructure, and R&D since World War Two.\nAnd with the executive order I’ll be signing today, we’ll increase Buy American requirements for these kinds of projects and improve the way we measure domestic content requirements. For example, right now, if you manufacture a vehicle for the federal government, you need to show that at least 50 percent of the components of that vehicle were made in America. But because of loopholes that have been expanded over time, you can count the least valuable possible parts as part of that 50 percent to say “Made in America,” while the most valuable parts — the engines, the steel, the glass, the manufac- — are manufactured abroad.\nSo basically — but basically we’re batting zero for two. The content threshold of 50 percent aren’t high enough. And the way we measure the content doesn’t account for U.S. jobs and economic activity. We’re going to change that as well.\nThe executive action I’m signing today will not only require that companies make more of their components in America, but that the value of those components is contributing to our economy, measured by things like a number of American jobs created and/or supported.\nAt the same time, we’ll be committed to working with our trading partners to modernize international trade rules, including those relating to government procurement, to make sure we can use — we can all use our taxpayer dollars to spur investment that promotes growth and resilient supply chains.\nAnd here’s what else the action does. When we buy America, we’ll buy from all of America. That includes communities that have historically been left out of government procurement — black, brown, Native American small businesses and entrepreneurs in every region of the country.\nWe will use a national network of manufacturers — called a Manufacturing Extension Partnership — that’s in all 50 states and Puerto Rico, to help government agency connect with new domestic suppliers across the country.\nThis is a critical piece of building our economy back better and including everyone in the deal this time, especially small businesses that are badly hurting in this economy.\nThe executive action I am taking also reiterates my strong support for the Jones Act and American vessels, you know, and our ports, especially those important for America’s clean energy future and the development of offshore renewable energy.\nI’ll close with this: The reason we need to do this is America can’t sit on the sidelines in the race for the future.\nOur competitors aren’t waiting. To ensure the future is made in America, we need to win not just the jobs of today, but the jobs and industries of tomorrow. And we know that the middle class built this country, and we also know unions built the middle class. So let’s invest in them once again. I know we’re ready, despite all of the — all we’re facing. I have never been more optimistic about the future of America than I am today.\nGiven even just half a chance, the American people,\nthe American worker, has never, ever let the country down. Imagine if we give them a full chance. That’s what we’re going to do.\nI’ll stop here and sign the executive order, and then come back and take some of your questions.\nThis executive order is entitled “Ensuring the Future Is Made in America, by Americans — All of American Workers.”\n(The executive order is signed).\nThere you go. Now I’d now be happy to take your questions.\nQ Thank you, Mr. President. Jonathan Lemire with the Associated Press. Two topics, if I may. The first: You have made reopening schools a central part of your first 100 Days agenda, and you’ve long portrayed yourself as an ally to the teachers and the unions. Right now, the Chicago Teachers Union has refused. They defied an order to return to in-person classing — for in-person classrooms because of a lack of vaccinations. Do you believe, sir, that teachers should return to schools now?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I believe we should make school classrooms safe and secure for the students, for the teachers, and for the help that’s in those schools maintaining the facilities. We need new ventilation systems in those schools. We need testing for people coming in and out of the classes. We need testing for teachers, as well as students. And we need the capacity — the capacity to know that, in fact, the cic- [sic] — or the circumstance in the school is safe and secure for everyone.\nFor example, there is no reason why the clear guidance will be that every school should be thoroughly sanitized, from the lavatories to the hallways. And so this is about making — and none of the school districts that I’m aware of — there may be some, of public school districts — have insisted that all of those pieces be in place.\nAnd, I might add, it’s the same kind of thing I hope we can do with small businesses and businesses, making sure they have the capacity to test their workers when they come in; to make sure they have plastic dividers between their booths in their — in their restaurants, et cetera; to make sure they can sanitize.\nSo it’s not so much about the idea that teachers aren’t going to work. The teachers I know, they want to work. They just want to work in a safe environment and as safe as we can rationally make it. And we can do that, and we should be able to open up every — every school, kindergarten through eighth grade, if, in fact, we administer these tests.\nAnd it’ll have the added advantage, I might add, of putting millions of people back to work – all those mothers and fathers that are home taking care of their children, rather than go to work. Even when they can work, they’re not able to do it unless they have the luxury of working distance-wise, like many of us do. They’re not able to do it. And so this is about generating economic growth overall as well.\nWHITE HOUSE AIDE: Great. Alex from Reuters.\nQ Thank you, Mr. President. I’m Alex Alper from Reuters. I wanted to ask a question about Navalny — if you are considering imposing sanctions on any of the individuals involved in his attempted poisoning and/or his arrest when he returned from Germany. And if not, is that related to your concerns about it potentially derailing a New START extension? Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT: I find that we can both operate in the mutual self-interest of our countries as a New START agreement, and make it clear to Russia that we are — we are very concerned about their behavior, whether it’s Navalny, whether it’s the SolarWinds, or whether it’s the reports of bounties on the heads of Americans in Afghanistan.\nI have asked the agencies in question to do a thorough — a thorough read for me on every one of those issues, to update me on precisely where they are. And I will not hesitate to raise those issues with the Russians.\nWHITE HOUSE AIDE: Jeff from NBC.\nQ President Biden, Vice President Harris, a question about your COVID relief deal. On Friday, you said the nation is “in a national emergency [and] we should act like it.” Given that — given the scale and the severity of the need, how long are you willing to get sufficient Republican support before you would greenlight Democrat attempts to use reconciliation, for instance, to pass that bill?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, look, the decision on reconciliation will be one made by the leaders of the House and the Senate. But here’s the deal: I have been doing legislative negotiations for a large part of my life. I know how the system works. And what I’m not — I can’t guarantee anything at all, but I can say that what I’m going to be doing — and we’ve already begun — is making it clear to the leadership in the House and the Senate, as well as the — the group of 16, the group — the bipartisan group, as well as Republican individuals who have an interest in the issues that are in package, and saying “Here’s what I’m doing, and here’s why I want to do it, here’s why I think we need to do it, and what kind of support can or can’t you give to that?” And then we go on to the way in which we deal with legislation all the time.\nYou know, we — we didn’t have any votes for the recovery package when Barack and I came into office. We were short three votes. We didn’t know we had the votes until the day of the –- the day of the — of the — bringing it up.\nAnd — but here’s the deal: You know, it’s interesting — and I know you ask a lot of these questions. You know the answers, but you have to — to help educate the public as well; I’m not suggesting you don’t know what I’m about to say. No one wants to give up on their position until there’s no other alternative. They either have to make a decision that they don’t do what — they don’t support what is being proposed, or they insist on what they have, or they let it all go away, fall down. I think we’re far from that point right now.\nThe decision to use reconciliation will depend upon how these negotiations go. And let me make clear about negotiations: I’ve always believed part of negotiation — on the part of a President and/or a chairman of a committee trying to get a major piece of legislation passed — is about consultation.\nIt’s not enough for me just to come up to you and say, “I like this. I expect you to support it.” I want to explain to you why I think it’s so important in this package that we have to provide for money for additional vaccines, why I think it’s so important why we provide for money to extend unemployment benefits, why I think it’s so important that we provide money to provide for the ability of people not to be thrown out of their apartments during this pandemic because they can’t afford their rent, and to make the case to you why I think and what I think the priorities within this piece — that we think the priorities are — I apologize — were within this legislation.\nAnd I don’t expect we’ll know whether we have an agreement or to what extent the entire package will be able to pass or not pass until we get right down to the very end of this process, which will be probably in a couple of weeks. But the point is, this is just the process beginning.\nWHITE HOUSE AIDE: Annie, the Washington Post.\nQ Thank you, Mr. President, Annie Linskey with the Washington Post.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Hi, Annie.\nQ I wanted to ask you a little bit about one of the, sort of, major themes of your campaign, and how you sort of intend to measure and enact it — and that is the idea of unity. If you could talk a little bit about what you see unity as being? There are some people who are defining it as being bipartisan. Others are saying it is what most of the people in the country, defined by some poll, might believe, or any sort of number of other — or perhaps it’s 50 plus 1, or 50 plus 2, or 75 percent.\nSo, given that it is such a key part of your message and your promise, can you talk and reflect a little bit more about what is unity when you see it and as you define it?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, Annie, I think it makes up several of the issues — the points you made. One is: Unity requires you to take away — eliminate the vitriol, make anything that you disagree with about the other person’s personality or their lack of integrity or they’re not decent legislators and the like — so we have to get rid of that. And I think that’s already beginning to change, but God knows where things go, number one.\nUnity also is: trying to reflect what the majority of the American people — Democrat, Republican, and independent — think is within the fulcrum of what needs to be done to make their lives and the lives of Americans better. For example, if you look at the data — and I’m not claiming the polling data to be exact, but if you look at the data, you have — I think it’s — I hope I’m saying this correct –- you may correct me if I get the number wrong, I think it’s 57, 58 percent of the American people — including Republicans, Democrats, and independents — think that we have to do something about the COVID vaccine; we have to do something about making sure that people who are hurting badly, can’t eat, don’t have food, are in a position where they’re about to be thrown out of their apartments, et cetera, being able to have an opportunity to get a job — that they all think we should be acting, we should be doing more.\nUnity also is trying to get, at a minimum — if you pass a piece of legislation that breaks down on party lines but it gets passed, it doesn’t mean there wasn’t unity; it just means it wasn’t bipartisan. I’d prefer these things to be bipartisan, because I’m trying to generate some consensus and take sort of the — how can I say it? — the vitriol out of all of this. Because I’m confident — I’m confident, from my discussions, there are a number of Republicans who know we have to do something about the food insecurity for people in this pandemic. I’m confident they know we have to do something about figuring out how to get children back in school.\nThere’s just — there’s easy ways to deal with this. One, if you’re anti-union, you can say it’s all because of teachers. If you want to make a case though that it’s complicated, you say, “Well, what do you have to do to make it safe to get in those schools?” And we’re going to have arguments.\nFor example, you know I proposed that we — because it was bipartisan, I thought it would increase the prospects of passage — the additional $1,400 in direct cash payment to folks. Well, there’s legitimate reason for people to say, “Do you have the lines drawn the exact right way? Should it go to anybody making over X-number of dollars or why?” I’m open to negotiate those things. That’s all.\nI picked it because I thought it was rational, reasonable, and it had overwhelming bipartisan support in the House when it passed. But this is all a bit of a moving target in terms of the precision with which this goes. You’re asking about unity: 51 votes, bipartisan, et cetera.\nThe other piece of this is that the one thing that gives me hope that we’re not only going to, sort of, stay away from the ad hominem attacks on one another, is that there is an overwhelming consensus among the major economists at home and in the world that the way to avoid a deeper, deeper, deeper recession, moving in the direction of losing our competitive capacity, is to spend money now to — from — from across the board, every major institution has said, “If we don’t invest now, we’re going to lose so much altitude, in terms of our employment base and our economic growth, it’s going to be harder to reestablish it.” We can afford to do it now. As a matter of fact, the — I think the response has been, “We can’t afford not to invest now. We can’t afford to fail to invest now.”\nAnd I think there’s a growing realization of that on the part of all but some very, very hard-edged partisans, maybe on both sides, but I think there is a growing consensus. Whether we get it all done exactly the way I want it remains to be seen, but I’m confident that we can work our way through.\nWe have to work our way through because, as I’ve said 100 times, there is no ability in a democracy for it to function without the ability to reach consensus. Other- — otherwise it just becomes executive fiat or battleground issues that are — get us virtually nowhere.\nI don’t want to hold the — my colleague may know, the Vice President — but, you know, I think there were very few debates on the Senate floor the whole last year —\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: That’s correct.\nTHE PRESIDENT: — on almost any issue.\nWell, that benefits no one. It doesn’t inform anybody. It doesn’t allow the public to make judgments about who they think is right or wrong.\nSo I am — I am optimistic that it may take some time, but over the year, the way — if we treat each other with respect — and we’re going to argue like hell. I’m confident of that. Believe me, I know that. I’ve been there. But I think we can do it in a way that we can get things done for the American people.\nWHITE HOUSE AIDE: Great. Last question. Josh from Bloomberg.\nQ Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Josh, they don’t trust you with the mic, huh? I don’t know, man.\nQ No, that’s fine. I wouldn’t either. (Laughter.) Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate you taking the questions.\nYou mentioned just now that you might know in a couple of weeks. Can I ask whether it’s more important for you to get something passed in a short timeframe like that or would you be willing to wait longer to get more bipartisan support?\nAnd might I also ask that — one of the pillars is the vaccine funding — when do you think any American who wants to get the shot will be able to get the shot?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I’ll try to answer the three parts to your question as I heard them.\nOne, time is of the essence. Time is of the essence. And I must tell you, I’m reluctant to cherry pick and take out one or two items here, and then have to go through it again to — because these all are kind of — they go, sort of, hand in glove, each of these issues. Number one.\nNumber two, we are optimistic that we will have enough vaccine and in very short order. We, as you know, we came in office without knowledge of how much vaccine was held — being held in abeyance or available. Now that we’re here — we’ve been around a week or so — we now have that. And we’ve gotten commitments from some of the producers that they will, in fact, produce more vaccine in a relatively short period of time and then continue that down the road.\nSo I’m quite confident that we will be in a position, within the next three weeks or so, to be vaccinating people at the range of a million a day or in excess of that. That is my — I promised that we would get at least 100 million vaccinations — that’s not people, because sometimes you need more than one shot of the vaccination. But 100,000 — 100 million shots in people’s arms of the vaccine.\nI think, with the grace of God, and the goodwill of the neighbor, and the creek not rising, as the old saying goes, I think we may be able to get that to 150 thou- — 1.5 million a day, rather than 1 million a day. But we have to meet that goal of a million a day.\nAnd everything points that we’re going to have: A, the — enough vaccine; B, enough syringes and all the paraphernalia needed to store, keep, inject, move into your arm the vaccine; three, a number of vaccinators, people administering the vaccine, which is not an easy task of those who have — those facilities, like the nursing homes and hospitals — they have people do it, but they don’t have the capacity to do everyone. And so I think we’re going to have — we’re leaning hard on — into areas where we can produce more vaccinators. We feel confident we can do that.\nAnd thirdly, it’s really important that we have the fora, the place, the facility, the circumstance where people can show up, stand in line, and get their vaccine without having to stand in line for eight hours — being able to pick up the phone, call the pharmacy, and get your name on the list, et cetera.\nAll those mechanical things are really — they sound simple, but they’re all consequential when we’re trying to get out a minimum of 100 million vaccinations in 100 days and move in the direction where we are well beyond that in the next 100 days so we can get to the point where we reach herd immunity in a country of over 300 million people. Did that answer your question?\nQ Well, my question was at what date — or, roughly, when do you think anyone who wants one would be able to get it? Summer? Is it (inaudible)?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Oh, I — no, I think it’ll be this spring. I think we’ll be able to do that this spring. And — but it’s going to be a logistical challenge that exceeds anything we’ve ever tried in this country, but I think we can do that.\nI feel confident that, by summer, we’re going to be well on our way to heading toward herd immunity and increasing the access for people who aren’t on the first — aren’t on the list, all the way going down to children and how we deal with that.\nBut I feel good about where we’re going, and I think we can get it done.\nWHITE HOUSE AIDE: Thank you, guys.\nQ One more. One more on vaccines. Mr. President, one more on vaccines.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Now, wait, wait, wait. I know he always asks me tough questions, and he always has an edge to them, but I like him anyway. So go ahead and answer — ask the question.\nQ Thank you, Mr. President. So you just said that you think within three weeks or so we’ll be at the point where there are a million vaccines per day, but it seems like —\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, I think we’ll get there before that. I said, “I hope…” — I misspoke. I hope we’ll be able to increase as we go on until we get to the million-five a day. That’s my ex- — my hope.\nQ And then my — the follow-up to that would be: Now that you’re President and you’re saying, “There is nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months,” what happened to two months ago when you were talking declaratively about “I’m going to shut down the virus”?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I’m going to shut down the virus, but not — I never said I’d do it in two months. I said it took a long time to get here; it’s going take a long time to beat it. And so we have millions of people out there who are — who have the virus.\nWe’re just, for the first day, I think — correct me if I’m wrong; I’ve been doing other things this morning, speaking with foreign leaders. But one of the things — I think this is one of the first days that the number has actually come down — the number of deaths — and the number on a daily basis, and the number of hospitalizations, et cetera.\nIt’s going to take time. It’s going to take a heck of a lot of time. And we still have — as Dr. Fauci constantly points out, it’s one thing when we have mass — how can I say it politely? — mass disregard of the warnings about not wearing masks and wearing masks, and social distancing and failure to social distance, and people getting together on holidays in ways that weren’t recommended, et cetera.\nWe see — the first thing that happens is we see the number of infections go up. Then you see the hospitalizations go up. Then you see the deaths go up. And so we’re in this for a while. I mean, we’re — what are we now? At about 410,000 deaths. And there’s going to be more. The prediction, as I said from the very beginning to getting here as — after being sworn in, was — the predictions were: We’re going to see somewhere between a total of 600,000 and 660,000 deaths before we begin to turn the corner in a major way.\nSo — and again, remember: The vaccine — most of the people taking the vaccine — a vast, significant number — required two shots, and they’re an average of three weeks apart. And it takes time for it to be sure that you’re — you get to that 95 percent assurance rate.\nAnd so it’s beginning to move. But I’m confident we will beat this. We will beat this. But we’re still going to be talking about this in the summer. We’re still going to be dealing with this issue in the — in early fall.\nAnd last point I’ll make — and I know you’re tired of hearing me saying it, particularly — you may be tired of me saying it. (Laughs.) And that is that if we wear masks between now and the end of April, the experts tell us we can save 50,000 lives — 50,000 people who otherwise would die.\nThank you so very much.\nEND 4:14 P.M.

The Police have to investigate those crimes.I think sending old people from hospitals to old folks homes might also constitute a major crime. Like murder.\nWhen old people even get a common cold, they can get very sick and die, A cold can turn into things like pneumonia etc. Old people in care homes have very weak immune system and are vulnerable to all sorts of things. If any of the patients from hospitals had the flu that would be devastating. Torturing them with isolation and keeping their families away long term, is a crime. Many died alone, without their families and friends by their side. That is beyond cruel.\nOttawa Canada: Parliament Hill Protest Feb 14, 2021\nUpdate from February 13, 2021\nThis should never be done to any child. The want to test the vaccines on babies. Experimenting on Babies as young as 6 months old-Wake up People\nUpdate from February 11, 2021 They tested 44 vaccines.These are just a few things they found in the vaccines: Aluminum, Silicon, Barium, Tungsten, Platinum, Silver, Lead, Copper, Zirconium There are more. How do these metals etc get into vaccines? Aluminum is now used instead of mercury in many, and it is bad for children’s health, but the other ones, that is a whole other story. What harm could they do, I have to wonder? I know many of them are toxic if you breath or eat them. Injecting them must be worse. There really needs to be more in depth studies into all the garbage, in vaccines. My jaw dropped after reading everything they found in them. Metals, Micro- Nanocontamination found in Vaccines\nThere is a new update to one of the posts below. It was updated February, 4, 2021– 2 More victims have been kidnapped at the airport in Canada.\nUpdate Feb 2, 2021\nThey did a lot of things back in the day to brain wash people.\nThey are using many of those techniques to brain wash people now. MK Ultra was used to do just that. There is a massive amount of information about this. Mask wearing/face covering, hoods is one of those techniques. Isolation, and this list goes on. They experimented on children too. I cannot find that part yet. they did make the some of the kids wear masks. They also sexually assaulted the children. I think it was about 500 children they used to experiment on.They controlled every aspect of their lives. Much like what is being done today. Stay home is isolation. Can’t travel farther then 5K of your home is open air prison. Taking away jobs, takes your control over your income and life. The news repeated, the same thing over and over. You can thank Dr Cameron for that. They are still doing that, repeating things that is, only we now have a part 2 a so called second virus. So again everyone hears the same thing over and over for days on end. They want to find a cure for Covid/cold/flu (The vaccines) I advise everyone to find out as much about the techniques, they used and have mastered. MK Ultra never ended. They have used, what they learned and improved those techniques over the years. I am sure they are also using techniques, used by China as well. We are being brain washed. There are still a few videos at youtube about MK Ultra. You might want to check them out and think about how things then, are similar to things now. The end goal is to make everyone feel completely helpless and just do what you are told. The Police are playing a big part in that. They do not help they persecute. They are doing the opposite, of what they should be doing. So, when your really need help, who do you call or turn to? There is no one. That is MK Ultra for sure. Anyone on pharma drugs are more susceptible to all of this. There sure are a lot of them out there. Dr Cameron would be considered a so called expert.\nThere is some information here on MK Ultra. This is just the tip of the iceberg.\nTed was ex FBI. He investigated many things. Child trafficking and many other areas. He investigated cults. He went down a lot of rabbit holes. He died in 20211. He did leave information behind. I advise downloading and keeping any files you find interesting as the site will vanish. It will give you a small idea of how things worked.\nOne of those groups is called The Finders, which Ted Gunderson said is operated by the CIA.\nA film called The Sleep Room highlighted the brainwashing experiments, including electroshock and sleep therapy, conducted on psychiatric patients by Dr. Ewen Cameron at Montreal’s Allan Memorial Institute in the 1950s and 1960s. Here is the Movie they talk about. A bit over 2 hours long. The Sleep Room The CIA and MK Ultra in Canada., This baced on the truth and can be verified by the Fifth Estate reports, also still on youtube. For all Canadians if you can download those videos, as they will vanish too.\nUpdate Feb 4, 2021\nWarning people can just vanish. 2 More victims have been kidnapped at the airport in Canada.\nCanada has become a complete insult to human dignity (your friends or relatives could just vanish)\nWell I found something that is worse then, Canada or maybe equal too it, a hospital in the US.\nNothing like holding a patient hostage or it could also be considered kidnapping of an old woman. This is not the world anyone wants to live in. This is insanity. The Police are as insane, as the so called Leaders, who are making the world into a dictatorship. Any and all Police should stop pulling this garbage. Their job is to protect the people. Seems world wide in most places, they are doing the opposite. They are waging war against the People. The People who pay their wages by the way. Now imagine if that was your mother, father, child, wife, husband, sister, brother, aunt, uncle or a close friend, in that hospital. How would you feel?\nThe WHO thinks this is a good idea. They think taking and locking people up is just fine and dandy. They even thin going into your home and taking your kids or whoever is a good idea. Ryan said that a while back.\nCommunity Bands Together to Rescue Elderly Woman Medically Kidnapped\nI listened to the WHO press conference for Jan 29, 2021 No mention of vaccines killing or maiming people. They just keep pushing the dangerous vaccines. By the way the vaccine for H1N1 Tedros talked about at the end, harmed a lot of children. For information on that go HERE Loads of information on the horrid things that happened, as well as a lot on how the WHO works with drug companies. Tedros must think everyone in the world is stupid.\nThey are responsible for many deaths and many more to come, from the Vaccines and the Lock downs.\nIf anyone trusts them, then they need to get some drastically needed help with that.\nThe reporters don’t even ask important questions. Like how many have died from the vaccines to date or been harmed.\nUpdate January 30, 2021\nThe VAERS system is reporting 329 deaths (and we know this is a tiny percentage. Less then 1% that is. ) and close to 10k injured. Go HERE for that information. Or check the VAERS link below.\nUpdate January 30, 2021 Adding VAERS\nIn the U.S., which relies almost exclusively on passive surveillance, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) Check it out you might be shocked, at what you find.\nThe site the story came from has updated their story a bit, WHO does change their recommendations rather often. One day they will say one thing and the next week or a month latter, that could change. I did find a video of them saying, to not wear a mask unless you were sick, however. It was from another date of course. But they did say that. They a few weeks ago, changed their mind on the cycles to run the PCR tests at. They lowered the cycles. Which means you get less false positives. But whatever. They have changed their mind on herd immunity I think twice or three times in the past year. Del Bigtee caught that one. They changed, what constitutes a pandemic a while back as well. The Children;s Health Defense caught that one, if I remember correctly. I have that one somewhere, but at the moment I don’t have time to hunt it down. They said lockdowns were good and then lockdowns are bad. I have no idea their thoughts on that one today. They are probably back to saying lockdowna are good. They change things all the time. So one day they could say one thing and then latter change it. Anyway the video in question will be below the story. You might want to download that, if you can. It might vanish like so many other things vanish these days.\nThere are some studies etc on the dangers of mask wearing in the following post. The BC Parent did some homework and a few other studies/reports have been added as well. Even on most packages they say they do not protect you from viruses.\nMessage to BC Educators from a Concerned Parent\nJanuary 25, 2021\nWritten by John O’Sullivan\nIn a telling admission made on January 22, 2021, the World Health Organization now say there is no scientific medical reason for any healthy person to wear a mask outside of a hospital. Sadly, our corrupt politicians and mainstream media only relate the bad news.\nIf you do not have any respiratory symptoms, such as fever, cough, or runny nose, you do not need to wear a medical mask. When used alone, masks can give you a false feeling of protection and can even be a source of infection when not used correctly.\nWatch the video of the press announcement at www.who.in Source\nFauci said don’t wear a mask Now he says wear two of them\nFauci said don’t wear a mask Now he says wear two of them\nWHO Admits High-Cycle PCR Tests Produce Massive COVID False Positives\nSo why are they saying this now?

Now, as the number of deaths has surpassed 400,000 in the US, Dr. Jensen and lawmakers are calling for an audit of these deaths.\nin the US they get $12,000 to $13,000 for patients admitted and testing positive for a COVID-19 diagnoses and another $39,000 again give or take, for those put on ventilators. Those number vary a bit from report to report.\nIf they have 161 covid patients, they get an extra $70,000 per patient. That one I just found out about via the video. Thank you Dr. Jensen. There should be an audit of deaths world wide, as death certificates were also changed in other countries as well. In the UK for example if you died 28 days after testing positive, you were counted as a covid death.\nhttps://www.bitchute.com/video/kaRWlJ0RpYIN/\nLas Vegas Schools Forced To Reopen Amid Rash Of Student Suicides\nby Tyler DurdenTuesday, Jan 26, 2021 – 17:45\nA surge of student suicides across Las Vegas has pushed the Clark County School District to reopen schools as soon as possible, according to NYTimes.\nBy December, eighteen students in the district had taken their own lives; an early-warning mental health system embedded within computers and tablets issued to students for remote learning received 3,100 alerts since schools shuttered their doors last March.\n“When we started to see the uptick in children taking their lives, we knew it wasn’t just the Covid numbers we need to look at anymore,” said Jesus Jara, the Clark County superintendent.\n“We have to find a way to put our hands on our kids, to see them, to look at them. They’ve got to start seeing some movement, some hope,” Jara said.\nEfforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 across the country have led to drastic changes in the way children and teens learn and socialize.\nGovernment data show a 24% increase in the number of children who arrived in emergency departments with mental health issues from mid-March through mid-October, compared with the same period in 2019.\nCountrywide, tens of millions of students have been thrown into a new distance learning environment that has resulted in many extracurricular activities being canceled. Recreational spaces have closed, sports canceled, and playdates shifted to Zoom calls, resulting in many kids developing mental issues, especially in Clark County.\nClark County administrators had GoGuardian Beacon alert system installed on every device given out to students after the sixth student suicide last year. The system alerted administrators of more than 3,100 cases where a student searched suicide-related material between June and October.\nIn one instance, a 12-year boy searched “how to make a noose” on his iPad.” Administrators quickly reached out to the boy’s parents as he was about to hang himself.\nThe alerts have been so disturbing to Jara that he doesn’t sleep near his phone anymore.\n“I can’t get these alerts anymore,” said Jara. “I have no words to say to these families anymore. I believe in God, but I can’t help but wonder: Am I doing everything possible to open our schools?”\nDr. Anthony Fauci has called for schools on a countrywide basis to reopen safely.\nAn indirect consequence of the pandemic and forcing children to learn at home has contributed to a rise of mental health issues and suicides among America’s future generation.

Thank you for all that you do Regards Leonard\nCould you give me a link to that video where he talks about the masks… I can’t find it on their website.\nThey chalk all of that up to having Covid. Now they are trying to say those who got the vaccines died of covid too. The PCR tests are covering up all the murders. PCR is not for testing for a virus. Add to that they have never isolated the so called virus. What really angers me is if you tested positive you were being misdiagnosed and getting the wrong treatment. Like if you went to the hospital with a heat attack and tested for Covid. They would treat you for covid and not the heart attack. If you die they also would say you died of Covid. They turned pneumonia and flu into covid. In the US if you had pneumonia the hospital got a bit over $4,000, if you tested positive for Covid the hospital got $12,000, get them on a ventilator they got yet another $36,000 or $39,000 not sure which and if they got 161 number of total patients, they got and extra $77,000 per patient. Now that explains why so many in the US had so many covid patients. They created covid patients for money.\nhttps://www.bitchute.com/video/kaRWlJ0RpYIN/\nCould you give me a link to that video where he talks about the masks… I can’t find it on their website.\nThe video where you say he mentions not needing the masks is over one hour long. do you know where abouts the reference to masks is? Thanks. Great article and links.\nCan’t find the WHO announcement.\nCatherine, start at 44 minutes.\nCould I have the link to the video that shows the WHO talking about not needing to wear a mask please. Nobody believes me so I want to show them.\nWhat is the time stamp for what you are saying as the backup for what you are claiming?\nI went to the timestamp on 4omins of the 22nd Jan press conference and they have not said about not wearing mask from what I heard?\nYou can’t find it on WHO cause they do recommend masks.\nWhen I saw those new 5g towers going up I did my research for the launch of them and the person in Wuhan getting the so called virus he was suffering from radiation poisoning just like my favor Aunt..I found the 18 page letter off appeals not launch 5g. Look the letter up and you’ll see Elon Musk has already launch what is to be about 20,000 satellite and Tmobile just advertising the death..listen to the commercial. It’s radiation that robbinh the body of oxygen. Look up radiation poisoning and you’ll see the symtoms are the same and so is the out come DEATH by suffication..\nWhere is a video to see him saying this no masks? thank-you\nThank you for providing the sharable link.\nWatched the video at the 44 minute mark as another reader suggested. The WHO did not appear to say what you allege. Did I miss something? Where did they say we don’t need to wear a mask?\nDo you have a timestamp for the “no mask” recommendation? That certainly beats listening to them drone on for an hour.\nat which point on the video do they mention the masks? the advice on the who websites hasn’t changed.\nThis is not what they said.\nYou make a claim in relation to the use of mass and a reference to WHO admission from 22 January 2021. Your claim is not correct . Are you misleading your readers? This press conference does contain any admissions I relation to the masks not being effective. If I am mistaken , please publish the video ” time stamp” next to thd video link.@!@@\nWhere in the video from the 22 January 2021, WHO is saying that “you do not need to wear a mask”. I listened to the video and they say , quite the opposite. Are you spreading misinfomaton?\nYour article is misinformation. The press conference video from 22 Jan 2021 does not say ” you do not need to work a mask”. Misinformation !!!!\nOk if this is the case then this should be announced on national news immediately! And we want to stop wearing them from now please! Enough is enough. Please stop this NOW\nI listened and nowhere in here do they say not to wear masks. There is ENOUGH misinformation out there as it is….please do not add to it. I do now wear masks and am trying to get others not to, but spreading DISINFO will not help my case in any way! Thanks for wasting my time!\nUnfortunately they do not say that. At about 44:30 Dr Maria Kanakova reccomends a 3 tier lined fabric mask and that individuals take as many precautions as you can. This answer then appears to be contradicted when Dr Souyama says that people with a higher risk of infection and those who will take benefit from should take precautions. they should leave the resy of us alone and let us make our own decsions. Goddammit.\nUnfortunately they do not say that.AT 44:30 Dr Maria talks about wearing a 3 tiered mask\nCan you send link to video from 22.1.2021 re masks and covid 19. I listened to vid on WHO site but could find the statement. Thanks\nThis is a lie. No where in WHO video does anyone state\nFalse claim , glad I verified before passing on information. Nowhere does it say You do not need to wear a mask. Lies like this are the reason the government is able to perpetrate their crimes\nBut, little weasel Fauci says we now need to wear two or three masks at once.\nCan you tell where exactly is this said because I can’t find it on WHO conferefence. There is something about masks on 22.01. at time mark of 44 min and after, but nothing close like mentioned in this article.\nFauci says a lot of things. None of which means much. He changes his mind, when it will make him more money. We have been lied to repeatedly over the last year. Tedros who is headed to the ICC for genocide etc I would never trust. I don’t trust anything, when it comes to the UN. Five countries have veto power over everything. Not very diplomatic in my books. They can stop any resolution with just one veto. These members are France, China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Russia. Nothing goes anywhere. unless they al agree. The rest is just window dressing. They just want everyone tax dollars to support their life styles. Finding anything at the web sites for WHO or the UN is also hard. I spend hours on end trying to find out how much they all get paid. They do have an interesting thing on how to manipulate/con people into getting vaccines. They praise vaccines galore. Bill Gates is a major donor along with drug companies/ entities Gates set up. Drug pushers run the WHO Seem that is all WHO is good for. The sure have a lot of propaganda there as well. People should all spend a few days reading all their stuff there and at the UN just to see how they are set up and what they do. Five members that have that much control over the rest of the world is a problem. They make laws that rule the rest of the world. Thanks, but no thanks. I never voted for that. I never voted, to give them any money either. You might enjoy this guy. He presents thing in a new way. He actually knows what he is talking about. I don’t much like the World Forum garbage either.\nThe Davos Agenda and The Rise of China\nhttps://www.bitchute.com/video/N2cOYlBVDT52/\nWHO changes things. They could even put a new video.\nWHO LOST ON HERD IMMUNITY <They changed this on heard immunity. Not once but twice since October I think it was. It could change next week, yet again. Just so you never get upset about finding things that vanish or change. I just think they changed it again. Oh well. They are consistently inconsistent. If you wander around the UN or WHO site I recommend screen shots. Then save them somewhere in your computer. The only reason they said they wanted mask wearing after telling the world No mask wearing, I think was China could make a whole lot of money selling them.\nChina uses slave labour to make many of those masks as well. They have been caught doing that one finally.\nAnyway this is how WHO changes their mind and in turn changes what they say. Bless Dels heart He and his helpers have caught them doing a lot of things.\nhttps://www.bitchute.com/video/u9DiOJrTkEX5/\nThey change things a lot there. They changed what we were suppose to do a number of times in the last year.\nThe WHO is very corrupt. Have been for years.\nLook at all the youtube channels that vanished. Parler vanished in what three days. To change something on a site takes about 4 or 5 minutes. So if something vanishes I don't even worry about it anymore. Words vanish or change and videos can be edited. Now Biden decided he wants the mask thing big time. Maybe they changed it for him. They wanted the money back that Trump took from them. Biden is giving it back now. The UN and the WHO are always whining they need more money. The US was giving them something like 400 million dollars.\nPlease provide a link to the WHO statement regarding masks.\nIt would be in one of the videos. While you are listening to them wait for them to talk about how many were harmed or died from the vaccines. While your there that is. They fail to mention all of that. Those vaccines have killed a lot of people. Do they bother to warn anyone Nope.\nI looked & can’t find the info so I don’t think this is real news!! Not cool!\nThat is absolutely not what the WHO recommends. Go read the source document you are referencing.\nYes I watched the January 22 video from WHO and I did not see or hear anywhere where they said there is no scientific evidence for wearing a mask outside of a hospital. Could you please provide the actual reference to the transcript where are the WHO actually made that comment.\nI’ve heard many doctors talk about successful therapy with HCQ, budesonide and iivermectin. They must not be profitable because they’re not mentioned at all on WHO site.\nAt what point in the press briefing do they say that user of masks is not recommended.\nI’ve just scanned the written dialogue of this meeting and can’t see it anywhere.\nWhere in your post does WHO state that you do not need to wear masks? Its not written or spoken in the video.\nPlease confirm as I have shared your post and am now being questioned on it.\nRegards Volker\nBRILLANT WORK!\nAt 44:50(ish) they reiterate that they DO recommend wearing masks – and are talking of 3 layers. Please correct your page – tyvm\nSome one else found it. I just re-posted their findings. They have done some great research on things.\nThe one thing we all must do, is watch the lies they keep telling us. These days it is how safe and effective the vaccines are. They are not safe and they are not effective. Many have died, a large number have been harmed or permanently disabled from them. Every day those numbers are growing.\nThose drugs have been removed in a few countries. For sure they are not big money makers. I think they want people to die. Why else would they remove or not allow doctors to use drugs that work? It also makes it easier to con people into the vaccine. For a so called virus with a 99 percent recover rate or not being sick at all a vaccine is not needed., Then again many of their recommendations like lockdowns will in the end kill more, then the so called virus. The kids committing suicide, would not have died from the so called virus. They died from the measures they lived under. We need to ask, how many children world wide have killed themselves? The suicide rates for adults has also gone up. Those suicides started quit a while back. The first one I found out about was a kid about 11 years old give or take a year. Just a wee tyke. His father told the story. His dad wanted to warn other parents to watch their children closely. Finally the media is starting to report some of that. Took them long enough. To little to late as they say.\nI knew it all along!! Its all about control. Where were the masks during the H1N1 outbreak in 2009?? Where were the stimulus payments then when.60 million ppl were infected?? Oh wait..Obama was in office. This whole thing was executed to gain power and control at our expense. Just my opinion\nFALSE INFORMATION. I have reported this site to WordPress. I believe the author is purposely misleading readers to believe something that is not true. The WHO never said why the author alleges. I am not in favor of masks but I am also not in favor of lying and being made to look a fool when sharing information like this. The author should be ashamed.\nI would be ecstatic to have the information in this article to be true, so if someone can actually verify that the WHO made such an announcement, please post the link in the comment section.\nFake news/clickbait\nLike many who have posted here, I too watched the entire 1 hour 8 minute WHO Conference and found NO MENTION WHATSOEVER of “You do not need to wear a Mask”. The ONLY mention, specific to masks, comes at the 44:00 mark and then only to talk about a 3-layer mask and how various cloth masks perform differently. There is absolutely NO REFERENCE WHATSOEVER to not having to wear a mask. There goes 1-hour of my life I won’t be getting back!!\nSee I am not the only person wasting time looking for the mask mention that isn’t there. Disappointed to see that David Icke reposted without first verifying.\ni watched the WHO broadcast and did not see where they no longer recommend masks, please post the clip thanks\nI watched the whole 1 hour 8 minutes of 22nd January, WHO press conférence and heard no reference to them saying you do need to wear a mask. What is the point of trying to combat false narratives if you put out the same?\nTheir own reports from last year stated that masks were ineffective against any kind of transmittable ‘virus’ or particulate matter. They derived this info not only from their own studies, but also from 2 decades worth of global studies that came to the same conclusion. Why? Because, the germ theory is a profitable theory, not a scientific, verifiable, and accurate theory. It’s insanity.\nDavos Ask yourself how much money is being made from those slaves? Masks are now a multi million dollar business. Maybe multi billion dollar business. They supply countries all over the world.\nWho Made Your Mask We Traced PPE to Uighur Workers in China-s Harsh Labor Program Coronavirus News\nhttps://www.bitchute.com/video/ha8y8Nfvj3It/\nChina is coming out with a new test as well.\nAnother fortune if they can suck countries into using it.

And I ask every American to join me in this cause.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Promising action the pandemic.\nBIDEN: Let me be very clear. Things are going to continue to get worse before they get better.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And the economy.\nBIDEN: We have to act now.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: America's 46th president confronts multiple crises, as the Senate prepares to try a former president for the first time.\nSEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Senators will have to decide if they believe Donald John Trump incited the insurrection.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: We cover it all this morning with Senators Amy Klobuchar and Rand Paul, America's next surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, and our powerhouse roundtable.\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\nANNOUNCER: From ABC News, it's \"This Week.\"\nHere now, chief anchor George Stephanopoulos.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Good morning and welcome to \"This Week.\"\nThe end came slowly, then suddenly. After a transition that redefined tumultuous, Inauguration Day opened with these final words from President Trump: \"Have a good life. See you soon.\"\nFollowed by this first declaration from President Biden: \"Democracy has prevailed.\"\nThe shift in style and substance was stark. Now comes the challenge of confronting the cascading crises outlined by President Biden in his inaugural address and confronting the behavior of President Trump that sparked an insurrection.\nOur new poll with Ipsos shows a solid majority of Americans approve of Biden's pandemic plans and believe he can make progress on unifying the country.\nBut the divisions in Congress already demonstrating how tough it will be for President Biden to advance his agenda.\nCongressional correspondent Rachel Scott starts us off.\nGood morning, Rachel.\nRACHEL SCOTT, ABC NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: George, good morning.\nAnd it is the impeachment trial of the former President Donald Trump that will be casting a shadow over President Biden's administration. Tomorrow, we will see that article of impeachment be walked over to the Senate.\nAnd then, on Tuesday, senators will be sworn in as jurors. But that impeachment trial will not be starting for two more weeks. We're looking at the week of February 8.\nAnd this is a delay that both sides agreed to. Democrats were worried about this balancing act of having the Senate juggle that impeachment trial, confirmation hearings, and trying to consider Biden's agenda. And Republicans wanted to give Trump more time to prepare. He's really struggled to put together a defense team.\nSo, this gives both sides the wiggle room that they were looking for. But, this morning, it is still unclear how long the trial will last, who will preside over it, and whether or not witnesses will be allowed.\nOf course, this is an unusual situation, where the lawmakers, the jurors in this trial, were all witnesses to what happened here on January 6. At least 17 Republicans in the Senate would need to join every single Democrat in order to convict the president. In the House, we saw 10 Republicans vote to impeach the president.\nBut now nearly every single one of those Republicans is facing significant backlash. Congresswoman Liz Cheney, the number three House Republican, she voted to impeach. She had some of the harshest words for Trump. She's now fending off attacks from her own party. She already has a primary challenger now, some Republicans calling for her to be removed from leadership.\nThat vote to impeach, George, has turned into a fight for her political life.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Boy, it sure has.\nOK, Rachel, thanks very much.\nLet's bring in our chief Washington correspondent, Jon Karl, for more on this.\nWe're seeing the backlash that Liz Cheney is facing in the House. That could complicate this push for conviction by the Senate Democrats.\nJONATHAN KARL, ABC NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: The bottom line, George, right now, Donald Trump is not going to get convicted in the Senate, unless there are major new revelations.\nMitch McConnell hasn't ruled out voting for conviction, but nobody who I have talked to talked to close to McConnell thinks there's any chance that he would actually vote to convict.\nThat said, George, during this trial, unlike the last impeachment trial, you're not going to see significant numbers of Republicans coming out to actually defend Donald Trump. They will focus on the process and the constitutionality.\nThey will argue that it is neither wise, nor is it constitutional, to convict somebody in an impeachment trial, a president who has already left office, that, although Donald Trump may have committed what amounts to high crimes and misdemeanors, impeachment is meant to remove a president from office, pure and simple, is what the Republicans will argue, and Donald Trump, of course, is already gone.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: President Biden has tried to stay out of this impeachment fight. He wants to advance his agenda at the same time, which means that both sides don't mind this couple-of-week delay.\nKARL: No, and certainly not Biden.\nLook, George, if you were to take a look at all of the priorities that Biden has for the beginning of his administration, impeachment would rank somewhere below 100.\nHe -- the Biden White House simply does not care about this. Their biggest concern is that impeachment could block Biden’s agenda in Congress. So no. Absolutely no complaints about the delay from either side, especially no complaints from Biden.\nGEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS CHIEF ANCHOR: And it appears that the Republican Party is coalescing around objections to the size of President Biden’s COVID relief plan.\nKARL: Yes, $1.9 trillion, they've made it clear -- really every Republican including Susan Collins, Mitt Romney, the ones you would expect to work with the president on this, have made it clear that's too much.\nThat said, you know, there does -- I think there is an emerging possibility of a compromise. But of course, George, the big question is, whether or not the two sides can come to an agreement about how to actually organize the Senate, there's a big dispute over whether or not to rule out the filibuster. That’s what McConnell was insisting on. And until that’s resolved, they won’t be able to do any of this.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Okay, Jon Karl, thanks very much.\nLet’s bring in two senators who will serve as jurors for Donald Trump's second impeachment trial. Democrat Amy Klobuchar, Republican Rand Paul.\nSenator Klobuchar, let me begin with you. And we just heard Jon Karl say that there is some hope, Senator Klobuchar, that there will be some bipartisan support for the president's bill.\nDo you believe that or will Democrats have to go it alone?\nUNKNOWN: Hey, guys. I’m down (inaudible).\nUNKNOWN: I didn’t -- I wasn’t --\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Sorry, Senator Klobuchar, are you there?\nOkay, let's start with Senator Rand Paul instead. I think we have some audio problems right there.\nSenator Paul, let me begin with a threshold question for you. This election was not stolen, do you accept that fact?\nSENATOR RAND PAUL, (R-KY): Well, what I would say is that the debate over whether or not there was fraud should occur, we never had any presentation in court where we actually looked at the evidence. Most of the cases were thrown out for lack of standing, which is a procedural way of not actually hearing the question.\nThere were several states in which the law was changed by the secretary of state and not the state legislature. To me, those are clearly unconstitutional and I think there’s still a chance that those actually do finally work their way up to the Supreme Court.\nCourts traditionally and historically don’t like to hear election questions. But yes. Were there people who voted twice? Were there dead people who voted? Were there illegal aliens who voted? Yes, and we should get to the bottom of it.\nI’ll give you an example. In my state, when we had a Democrat secretary of state, she refused, even under federal order, to purge the roles of illegal voters. We got a Republican secretary of state and he purged the rules.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But Senator Paul, I have to --\n(CROSSTALK)\nPAUL: -- difference and those things do have to --\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: I have to stop you there. No election is perfect. But there were 86 challenges filed by President Trump and his allies in court, all were dismissed. Every state certified the results --\nPAUL: Chris, not for --\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: -- after an investigation --\nPAUL: Not for -- but --\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: -- count (ph), after investigations --\nPAUL: -- of evidence. They were dismissed --\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: -- counts and recounts.\nPAUL: -- for (inaudible).\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: The Department of Justice led by William Barr said there's no widespread evidence of fraud. Can’t you just say the words, this election --\nPAUL: No.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: -- was not stolen?\nPAUL: Well, what I would suggest is -- what I would suggest is that if we want greater confidence in our elections, and 75 percent of Republicans agree with me, is that we do need to look at election integrity and we need to see if we can restore confidence in the elections.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Well, 75 percent of Republicans agree with you because they were fed a big lie by President Trump and his supporters to say the election was stolen. Why can't you say --\nPAUL: Well, I think --\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: -- President Biden won a legitimate, fair election --\nPAUL: -- I think where you make a mistake in -- hey, George. George. George, where you make a mistake is that people coming from the liberal side like you, you immediately say everything's a lie instead of saying there are two sides to everything.\nHistorically what would happen is if said that I thought that there was fraud, you would interview someone else who said there wasn’t. But now you insert yourself in the middle and say that the absolute --\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Well --\nPAUL: -- fact is that everything that I’m saying is a lie.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Well, because --\nPAUL: (Inaudible) fact --\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: -- Senator, I said what the president said was a lie because --\nPAUL: -- we’re going to.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Hold on a second. He said the election was stolen. This election was not stolen. The results were certified in every single state --\nPAUL: You’re saying --\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: -- after counts (ph) and recounts.\nPAUL: -- there was -- you’re saying -- you’re saying that absolutely it was -- you’re saying there was no fraud and it’s all been investigated and that’s just not true.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: That’s not what I said, sir.\n(CROSSTALK)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: I said the Department of Justice found no evidence --\nPAUL: (Inaudible) --\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Let me finish my point.\nPAUL: But you say it’s all lies --\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You said something that was not true.\nPAUL: You say we’re all liars. You just simply say we’re all liars and --\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: I said it was a lie --\nPAUL: -- (inaudible) --\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: -- that the election was stolen.\nPAUL: -- premise (ph) that you’re right and we’re wrong.\nWell, let -- no. Let’s talk about the specifics of it.\nIn Wisconsin, tens of thousands of absentee votes had only the name on them and no address. Historically those were thrown out, this time they weren't. They made special accommodations because they said, oh, it’s a pandemic and people forgot what their address was.\nSo they changed the law after the fact. That is wrong, that's unconstitutional. And I plan on spending the next two years going around state to state and fixing these problems and I won’t be cowed by liberals in the media who say, there's no evidence here and you're a liar if you talk about election fraud.\nNo, let's have an open debate. It’s a free country.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: There is no widespread evidence of election fraud that overturned that results. That was stated as well by the Department of Justice led by President Trump's attorney general.\nIn Wisconsin, there were counts and recounts --\n(CROSSTALK)\nPAUL: It was never studied. Even that's not true. Even that’s not true. Even that's not true.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: William Barr said that directly.\nPAUL: Barr said that, but there was -- yes, he said that, yes. That was a pronouncement.\nThere's been no examination, thorough examination of all the states to see what problems we had and see if they could fix them.\nNow, let me say to be clear, I voted to certify the state electors because I think it would be wrong for Congress to overturn that.\nBut at the same time, I’m not willing just to sit here and say, oh, everybody on the Republican side is a liar and there is no fraud. No, there were lots of problems and there were secretaries of state who illegally changed the law and that needs to be fixed.\nAnd I’m going to work hard to fix it. And I won’t be cowed by people saying, oh, you’re a liar.\nThat’s the problem with the media today is they say all Republicans are liars, and everything we say is a lie. There are two sides to every story. Interview somebody on the other side, but don’t insert yourself into the story to say we’re all liars, because we do think (ph) there’s some fraud and the election needs to be fixed.\n(CROSSTALK)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Sir, there are not -- there are not two sides to this story. This has been looked in every single state.\n(CROSSTALK)\nPAUL: Sure there are. There are two sides to every story. George, you're forgetting who you are. You’re forgetting who you are as a journalist if you think there's only one side.\nYou're inserting yourself into the story to say I’m a liar because I want to look at election fraud and I want to look at secretaries of state who illegally changed the voter laws without the permission of their state legislatures. That is incontrovertible, it happened.\nAnd you can't just sweep it under the rug and say, oh, nothing to see here, and everybody is a liar and you're a fool if you bring this up. You’re inserting yourself into the story. A journalist would hear both sides and there are two sides of a story.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: I’m standing -- I’m standing by facts. There are not two sides to facts. I did not say this was a perfect election. I say the results were certified. I said it was not stolen. It is a lie --\n(CROSSTALK)\nPAUL: You’re saying people are liars. You're saying people are liars if they won't investigate what happened in the election.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: That's not what I said.\nPAUL: Should we investigate the fact that tens of thousands of absentee ballots did not have addresses on them and normally were disqualified, but this time, they were counted? Should we examine that?\nI don’t know whether it affected the election or not, but I have an open mind. And if we had actually examine this and we find out it didn’t, that’s fine. But it still should be fixed.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: There can be more investigations. The investigations that have taken place have shown there’s not enough fraud to change the results of this election. That has been certified by every state. It was stated by the Justice Department and the attorney general.\nPAUL: And I accepted the states' certifications. But it doesn't mean that I think there wasn’t fraud and that there weren’t problems that have to be investigated. And it doesn’t mean that the law wasn’t broken.\nI believe in Pennsylvania, they broke the law, and I believe if that ever will get a real hearing in the Supreme Court, it was denied for standing. It wasn’t actually taken up. If it were taken up, I do believe that the Supreme Court would overrule and say that they did break the law illegally.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: I asked you a very simple question, was the election stolen or not?\nPAUL: I think there was great deal of evidence of fraud and changing of the election laws illegally. And I think a thorough investigation is warranted.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Paul, thanks for your time this morning.\nLet me bring in Senator Klobuchar now.\nLet me talk, first of all, Senator Klobuchar, about this impeachment proposal now in the Senate, the trial's going to start on February 9th. I was hoping to get to this with Senator Paul. We ran out of time there.\nBut the GOP signaling they're going to make a process argument, that it's not constitutional to try a former president. That it won’t be legitimate if Chief Justice Roberts does not preside.\nYour response?\nSEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): It is constitutional. We have precedent from way back when a secretary of war was tried after he had left office and, obviously, there's a remedy that would help in the future which would ban former President Trump from running again.\nBut as I listened to Rand Paul, George, I just kept thinking, man, this is why Joe Biden won.\nThe American people right now are struggling. They need pandemic relief. They are literally trying to balance their toddlers on their knees and their laptops on their desks, and teaching their first graders how to use a mute button just to go to school. They need help.\nAnd I thoroughly believe that we can handle this impeachment trial and just as the American people are doing, juggle what we need to get done. Get the homeland security secretary through.\nWe just had the insurrection at the Capitol. Get people confirmed for Joe Biden's cabinet. And yes, get people the help that they need. That’s what this next month is going to be about.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You just heard Jon Karl say he doesn’t believe there are the votes there to convict President Trump right now. And we saw President Trump after the first trial, and we’re going to show these pictures right here when the votes weren’t there to convict. He waived the acquitted headlines, said this was vindication for him.\nAre you concerned that could happen again?\nKLOBUCHAR: My colleagues have not yet committed about what they're going to do and the news we just got out of \"The New York Times\" yesterday that the president was actually actively trying to take out his own attorney general and put in an unknown bureaucrat conspiring with him. I think we're going to get more and more evidence over the next few weeks as if it's not enough that he's sent an angry mob down The Mall to invade the Capitol, didn't try to stop it, and a police officer was killed. I don't really know what else you need to know. The facts were there. We saw it right there on the platform during the inauguration, as you could still see the spray paint at the bottom of many of the columns.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But if the votes aren't there to convict, would you pursue instead either a censure or some kind of a resolution under the 14th Amendment to prevent President Trump from running for office again?\nKLOBUCHAR: We're focused on impeachment, but there are many options. Things can be looked at. But I think the thing that your viewers need to know right now, George, is that we must do many things at once.\nThere is so much problems out there for the American people. They want those vaccines. And I am so glad that Joe Biden invoked the Defense Production Act so we can get them produced, we can get the distribution centers set up, we can make sure that schools can open again. That's what he's focused on. That's what we're focused on. And we can do this impeachment trial at the same time.\nWe could run it in the afternoons. Confirm the nominees in the morning and pass legislation at night.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: As you know, you don't have an agreement with the Republicans --\nKLOBUCHAR: I'm just stick and tired of hearing about the politics of how this would work.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: As you know, you don't have an agreement yet to get that --\nKLOBUCHAR: Well, that's going to be the thing that has to be negotiated.\nYou're right.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And that's what I want to ask you about.\nKLOBUCHAR: All right. OK.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Whether you can get the organizing resolution through. And also with Republicans now saying that the president's plan is far too big, do you still hold out hope for a bipartisan agreement or are Democrats going to have to go it alone through reconsolidation?\nKLOBUCHAR: We had a fine agreement back in 2001. I wasn't there. But George Bush was president. And we worked it out with even numbers on the committees. But Democrats can be in charge this time because of the fact that we have the deciding vote. Those are things that can be worked out easily. Mitch McConnell knows it.\nSecondly, when it comes to how we're going to get things done, we're in charge and we've -- with even votes we should be able to get legislation to the floor, including the pandemic relief package. As for the amount, the amount that Joe Biden has proposed, that's exactly the numbers we were talking about last summer. And at some point the administration was talking those numbers.\nAnd why do we need it? Because we don't even have areas of our country are getting very small numbers of the vaccine. We've got people with pre-existing conditions that have been literally isolated for nearly a year waiting for help with this vaccine. Of course we need the funding to get that vaccine distribution out there. We've got to stop messing around and get our economy going again. That's what Joe Biden's proposal is about.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Klobuchar, thanks for your time this morning.\nKLOBUCHAR: Thanks, George.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: President Biden's pick for surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, is up next.\nPlus, our powerhouse roundtable.\nStay with us.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nPRESIDENT JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.: Our plan starts with mounting an aggressive, safe and effective vaccination campaign to meet our goal of administering 100 million shots in our first 100 days in office.\nQUESTION: Is that high enough? Shouldn't you set the bar higher? That's basically where the U.S. is right now.\nBIDEN: When I announced it, you all said it's not possible. Come on, give me a break, man.\nSTAFF: (inaudible), guys...\n(CROSSTALK)\nBIDEN: It's a good start, 100 million.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Joe Biden bristled a bit when asked if his vaccine plan is ambitious enough. But there are big questions going forward, as the COVID death toll threatens to climb past 600,000 in the coming months.\nHere to answer some of them, the president's nominee for surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy.\nDr. Murthy, thank you for joining us this morning.\nLet's talk about that goal for 100 million vaccines in 100 days. As you know, it's -- many experts have weighed in, saying the plan is not ambitious enough; we need to do better.\nCan we do better? Will we do better?\nMURTHY: Well, thanks, George. It's great to be with you today. You know, as President Biden has said, he's set a goal of 100 million shots in his first 100 days in office. That's a floor; it's not a ceiling. It's also a goal that reflects the realities of what we face, what could go right but also what could go wrong.\nAnd I think President Biden fully understands there's a larger goal here, as we all do, which is that we've got to vaccinate as many Americans as possible. And that's going to take a lot of work, work dispelling this disinformation, working on the supply, increasing distribution channels.\nAnd that's some of what the vaccine plan that he announced over the last week is intended to -- to achieve.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Are there ways to increase the supply, number one?\nAnd number two, on the distribution, it appears, at least in these first vaccines that have gone out, they've been going largely to wealthier areas of the country, largely to whiter areas of the country.\nIs there a way to get more equitable distribution and increase the supply?\nMURTHY: Well, it's the right question, George, because success has to be gauged not just by the number of vaccines we deliver but also by how fairly we deliver those vaccines, how equitably we deliver them.\nWe already know from the COVID crisis over the past year that there are certain communities that have been hard hit by this virus, that rural communities have had a harder time getting access to resources, that communities of color have experienced more cases and deaths, that seniors have struggled, especially those in long-term facilities.\nAnd what we've got to do here is not just, again, increase supply, which we can do using the Defense Production Act, making specific syringes that can extract more vaccine from the Pfizer bottles, but we've also got to set up the kind of distribution channels, like mobile units, like strategically placed community vaccination centers, that can reach people who traditionally are hard to reach and don't have access to health care.\nLastly, George, we have got to track our progress. We have got to make sure that we have data on where the vaccine is being administered, so that we can ensure that it, in fact, is being distributed equitably.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: How about the next vaccine, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine? Is that close to approval?\nMURTHY: Well, we're hopeful that we will get good news on that front, George, because the truth is, the more vaccine that we have in terms of options, in terms of supply, the more quickly we will be able to vaccinate the country.\nBut what's important is that we focus and plan for what we have right now. And the goal of achieving 100 million shots in 100 days is one that is achievable with the supply that we have and that we're anticipating from Pfizer and from Moderna.\nAnd that's what we have got to focus on. So, we hope for the best, but we have got a plan for the situation we have now.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: I want to ask you about this variant of the -- COVID that is now in the United Kingdom. At least 20 states say it's here now as well.\nAnd the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, said this week there is evidence that it is more deadly than other strains. I know that, last month, you said we didn't have enough evidence to say that it's more deadly. Has that changed?\nMURTHY: Well, I'm glad you're bringing this up, George, because the variants are very concerning.\nBut they are not surprising, because this is what viruses do. They mutate, they change. And we should expect them. But here's what we know. We know that the variant, not just the U.K. variant, but likely the South Africa variant, the Brazilian variant, P.1, are likely to be more transmissible.\nAnd while there's some early data that was reported on earlier this week that the U.K. variant may, in fact, be more deadly, we still need more data to clearly understand the answer to that question.\nBut here's a larger lesson, George, from the variants. They are really a shot across the bow. The virus is basically telling us that it's going to continue to change, and we have got to be ready for it. And what does that mean?\nWell, it means we have got to, number one, do much better genomic surveillance, so we can identify variants when they arise. It means we have got to double down on public health measures, like masking and avoiding indoor gatherings.\nIt also means investing more in something we haven't talked about very much recently, which is in treatment strategies, which have received a lot less attention than vaccines, but are really important.\nAnd, above all, this means in -- that we have got to invest a lot more in testing and in contact tracing, because these also are going to be essential. So, the bottom line is, we're in a race against these variants. The virus is going to change. And it's up to us to adapt and to make sure that we're staying ahead.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Are you confident that we can meet President Biden's other goal, to get most elementary schools open in the first 100 days?\nMURTHY: Well, that's a very important goal.\nI'll tell you, as a parent who has two young children, one of whom is trying to do virtual learning because his school is not open, and we're all struggling with that, I know how critical it is for schools to get open, for parents, for the economy, for all of us.\nBut it's going to take a lot of work, though. And on several fronts, we have got to focus, number one, getting clear guidance to schools on what they need to do to reopen. Number two, we have got to make sure schools have the resources to be able to reopen and take these measures.\nAnd a lot of them don't have the resources. I mean, keep in mind, George, that, each and every day, we have teachers across the country who are reaching into their pocket to find a few dollars to pay for supplies for their kids. They don't have money to pay for the safety provisions that are needed on their own.\nWe have got to get them those resources. If we get them the resources and the guidance, I do think that we can get on a path to reopening schools more safely. But it's also going to take us getting the background number of cases down in our communities.\nAnd that's where we all come in. Achieving these goals, turning COVID around, is a goal that we have to undertake together as one nation. And if we -- if we do that, then I'm confident we can turn this pandemic around.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And, finally, can we get to herd immunity before the next school year begins in September?\nMURTHY: Well, I think that's an ambitious goal. I think what -- I think we can see improvement. I think we can see reductions in cases and hospitalizations and deaths. I think we can see many more people immunized.\nBut I think what's important here, rather than focusing on a specific number in terms of percentage of the population for herd immunity, is to recognize that, the more people we vaccinate, the better we will do, the fewer outbreaks we will see, the sooner we can get back to our way of life.\nAnd that's what we have got to focus on right now. That means each and every one of us has to think about how we can dispel misinformation, make sure our family and friends have the right information. It means, as soon as possible, as -- when the categories are open to us, that we make an appointment and go get vaccinated ourselves.\nIf we do these things, and if we continue to work on taking the safety precautions, like masking and avoiding indoor gatherings of people outside your household, then I think we can be on a path to not only turning the pandemic around, but, most importantly, getting our schools open, our workplaces back up and running, and regaining our way of life.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Dr. Murthy, thanks for your time this morning.\nMURTHY: Thank you so much, George. Good to be with you.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Nate Silver and our roundtable coming up. We'll be right back.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nROBERT FROST, POET: The land was ours before we were the land’s. She was our land more than 100 years. Before we were her people.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Roundtable is ready to go. We'll be right back.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nJOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward. And we must meet this moment as the United States of America. If we do that, I guarantee you we will not fail.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nGEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS CHIEF ANCHOR: It is Joe Biden's inaugural week. And as we noted up top, our new poll with IPSOS shows most Americans are confident that Biden can make progress on unifying the country.\nFiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver took a look at how long that might last.\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\nNATE SILVER, FIVETHIRTYEIGHT: President Biden is starting out with positive marks as Americans look to turn the page after a challenging year. According to our recent ABC News/\"Washington Post\" poll, 67 percent of voters approved of his presidential transition as compared to 40 percent for President Trump four years ago.\nOdds are, though, that this will fade as it has for previous presidents. Barack Obama's approval rating peaked at 65 percent when he first entered office but failed to under 50 percent within his first year. And Bill Clinton's numbers fell from 60 percent to 37 percent just five months into his term.\nAt the same time, Biden could have more of a wind at his back than you might think. There are a couple of key reasons for that. So let's break them down.\nFirst, the economy is expected to grow by 4.3 percent this year as it recovers from the COVID pandemic, which, if it happens, would make for the strongest year since 1999.\nOne more thing that could help Biden, ironically, is that Democrats have such narrow majorities in Congress that they're unlikely to have the votes for anything terrible unpopular, like Obamacare was in 2009. And the stimulus package that Congress might consider poll pretty well.\nFinally, although there aren't that many swing voters left these days, Biden has always done well with independents. He carried them by 13 points on election day.\nAnd his more, how do I put it, traditional approach to governments is likely to form an especially favorable contrast to Trump after the violent end to his term.\nSo if the question is, do you buy that Biden can unite the country? I mean it's a pretty high threshold to clear and I think the obvious answer is no. But I do think he has above average chances of having a successful first year or two in office if he can get the COVID pandemic under control.\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Thanks to Nate for that.\nThe roundtable is up next.\nWe're back in 60 seconds.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP: It is my greatest honor and privilege to have been your president. I will be watching; I will be listening; and I will tell you that the future of this country has never been better. I wish the new administration great luck and great success. I think they'll have great success. They have the foundation to do something really spectacular. So have a good life. We will see you soon.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: President Trump's final words as president, right there, on Wednesday, Inauguration Day.\nBig week in politics. Let's talk about it on our roundtable, joined by Chris Christie; Rahm Emanuel; Margaret Hoover, the host of \"Firing Line\" on PBS, also a CNN contributor; and our political analyst Matthew Dowd.\nAnd, Chris, let me begin with you. I mean, let's start out with that back-and-forth I had with Rand Paul. You've got significant members of your party who simply can't say the election wasn't stolen.\nCHRIS CHRISTIE, FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR AND ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, listen, George, I don't think there's any question that what the whole country needs to -- needs to focus on, in terms of our elections, is making sure that we have some effective electoral reform.\nNobody wants to wait a week or two weeks or three weeks, which happened in some of the House races, to get election results. We need to work on that and make the system better for 2022.\nBut this election was not stolen. All of the facts point in that direction. And I'm a former prosecutor, George. I make decisions based upon evidence, not based upon feelings or partisanship or loyalty. You make those decisions based upon evidence.\nAnd the evidence here has shown right from the beginning that, while every election has some irregularities and I'm sure this one did, too, there were no type of irregularities that would have changed the result in any one state, let alone the four states that would need to have been changed for the result of the election to have been changed.\nAnd folks in my party who are doing that quite frankly are just trying to make political points with those people who the president and others lied to about this over the course of the 10 weeks after the election. And it's shameful that they're doing it.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And, Margaret Hoover, what does it mean for the Republican Party going forward?\nMARGARET HOOVER, PBS \"FIRING LINE\" HOST AND CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Look, the Republican Party, there's no question, it's fractured. And we -- a lot is going to depend on how Mitch McConnell, the leaders in Washington -- frankly, a real difference between the Republicans in the Senate and the Republicans in the House of Representatives -- navigate the next two to four weeks, and then what President Trump does out of office.\nYou know, there's -- he's rabble-rousing that he's going to start his own third party. I don't think he has a real sense of historic irony there. There is a history of conservative populist third parties in this country that don't have a lot of political success. I'm looking at the Know Nothings, the American Independence Party, the Dixiecrats.\nSo they can do that. But the Republicans, if they're going to be successful, are going to need to grow the party from the middle, build out with Latinos and black Americans. And Republicans know how to do this. If you look at Republican governors in blue states, Larry Hogan, Phil Scott, Charlie Baker, they need to take a page from those playbooks. That's how you grow the Republican Party into the future.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Matthew Dowd, let me finish this off with you. Can the Republican Party avoid this reckoning? Is it going to fracture?\nMATTHEW DOWD, ABC NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: No, it can't avoid the reckoning, because the problem is, is that they have a loyalty to a person or a party more so than they do the truth.\nThere are some Republicans like Chris Christie that have spoken the truth in this regards in the aftermath of the November election. But when you put the interest of a person and an autocracy over the interests of our democracy and our Constitution, this is the problem you get into.\nRight now, though, the fracture is going to only be a small part of people, of Republicans who are reasonable and who believe in the truth and a much larger part of the Republican Party who buys into conspiracy theories and only wants power for power's sake. And in the end of it -- and so if there is a fracture, it means a small part of the Republican Party, who probably ends up aligning with the Democrats in the short term, and is that small part, and then the larger 75 percent or 80 percent of the party, if you look at every poll, still supports the, sort of, autocratic moves that President Trump made before Election Day and spoke and made after Election Day.\nThat's the fundamental problem today with the Republican Party.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So -- so, Rahm Emanuel, what does this mean for President Biden's agenda going forward?\nYou see resistance to his -- to his COVID plans right off the bat. And you know that this impeachment trial is going to complicate his early days.\nRAHM EMANUEL, ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, George, I actually -- let me reframe the question, because I think, actually, impeachment for both parties, your question is, does it derail the president's agenda?\nAnd so far, he's shown nothing but concentration and capability around COVID and also about moving the country forward. I actually think, for the Republicans, rather than for Biden, it's about derail for them. It is about this division.\nWe just spent three answers about how bad Donald Trump still is for the Republican Party. And he's driving a Grand Canyon-like wedge in the Republican Party. You see what's going on in Arizona. The 10 Republicans in Congress all have primaries.\nAnd I would say to you that the impeachment is more of a threat of division within the Republican Party than it is about derailing Joe Biden's agenda. They're going to be able to show that they can move forward. And that's what the executive orders showed. And that's what the agenda has showed.\nAnd I do think one other thing. We shouldn't confuse unity that the president's calling for with consensus in Congress. Those are not the same thing, and collapse them into the same -- into some one meaning.\nUnity is actually having a White House that has best practices, rather than being a super-spreader event. Unity is around how to achieve 100 million doses of vaccination, vs. having bleach and Lysol recommended as health care events, so -- or health care medications.\nSo, to me, the country's responding to the president's notion COVID of concentration, capability and competence. And there is unity around that. And I think the country's responding to Joe Biden because it's calmed down, it's focused, and it's dealing with the number one threat to the country.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Chris -- Chris Christie, what's the best way for Republicans in Congress now in both the House and the Senate to approach that?\nCHRISTIE: Well, listen, I think they have to be smart about supporting a COVID package that makes sense.\nNow, what it's starting to look like to me is, it's becoming a Christmas tree where everybody gets to hang their favorite ornament on it. I don't know what a $15 minimum wage has to do with COVID relief at the moment. We're talking about immediate relief that we need to get to individuals, to small businesses, and to make sure that our vaccination program is as efficient and effective as possible.\nThat's what Republicans should be talking about. And I think that, again, this is going to be one of those battles we're going to see. And we're much better as a Republican Party when we're talking about issues that are going to matter to the American people.\nWe're going to need to get a COVID package done. We will get a COVID package done. But we shouldn't just give in on every one of those pieces. And that's what we should be focused on, is talking about it and challenging why certain things are in that package that, quite frankly, in my view, don't belong there.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So, Margaret Hoover, that is going to present a big challenge to Joe Biden. He is going to, in some ways, have to choose between size and speed.\nThe bigger the bigger the package is, the harder it's going to be to get Republican support quickly. The smaller it is, he can get it out quickly, and show tangible results for real Americans.\nHOOVER: That's exactly right.\nAnd I think, if anybody can negotiate that, navigate that, look at the 50/50 Senate. And Joe Biden is a pragmatist, and he knows how to negotiate. I think we're going to see a COVID package, and it won't be everything that Chuck Schumer and the progressives want, but it'll be a package that will probably be more targeted, frankly, to the real businesses that need the relief, rather than these blanket checks to everyone.\nLook, I have a lot of confidence in Joe Biden. He does get a little bit of a honeymoon period. And then we're going to be onto impeachment. I just have to say, reconciliation, with what happened in the Republican Party, is something that I suspect you're going to have Mitch McConnell and the Republicans go along and try to get a COVID deal done.\nBut I suspect that Mitch McConnell would like to see the climate created for a very fair and judicious impeachment project -- impeachment process that could lead to conviction of the president. And I think that's why you see him -- Chuck Schumer agreeing to his timeline.\nI think that's why you see them being very methodical about it, so they can't hang this out on a procedural vote, that they -- that it is fair. And if he is able to create the circumstances and the climate around a fair trial, they may just get 67 votes to convict.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: It seems like a hard climb right now, Matthew Dowd.\nIs it necessary for the Republican Party?\nDOWD: Well, to me, the impeachment vote, we have to separate the parts of the impeachment vote.\nI mean, other countries have gone through this before, Germany, Japan, South Africa. And the thing before you get to -- before you get to reconciliation and healing, you have to have some element of truth and accountability-ness.\nAnd even besides those foreign country examples, we have an example in our country during Reconstruction, in the aftermath of the Civil War, when we went through -- we were supposed to go through a process of truth and accountability and changing the nature of what went on.\nAnd when Abraham Lincoln was killed, and Andrew Johnson took over, reconciling, the idea of forming a thing and demanding truth was stopped.\nWhat did that result in, George? It resulted in this country of Jim Crow laws, it resulted in this country of the KKK, and it resulted in this country of 100 years more of a fight for justice and truth and equality in our country. And so, we have to get to a situation where, yes, let's have a discussion of what was the truth, what did Donald Trump do, what should be his accountability and the final stage of that should be, what should be his punishment.\nAnd to me, the only way to do that is to have a conversation in the trial in the Senate or facts and knowledge and data and information that’s presented in such a way that the American public can see exactly what went on, what was Donald Trump responsible for, what should he held accountable to, and then ultimately, what should his punishment be?\nBut we should not do what happened in reconstruction, when reconstruction was ended and we went through this huge, long, century-long process when justice finally prevailed in the end.\nWe have to have an insight into the truth before we get to reconciliation and healing.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Agree with that, Rahm Emanuel?\nEMANUEL: One hundred percent. Let me say this, George, when somebody's running around the capitol with t-shirts that say Camp Auschwitz, Confederate flags, 6 million wasn’t enough -- I’m sorry, there is not a statute of limitation when it comes to defending the constitution. And if you have a wounded body in politic, it must be disinfected to be cleaned.\nAnd this story is going to get worse as time goes on and that’s what Mitch McConnell knows. It is not going to get better in the next three, four weeks, information is not static here.\nAnd you're going to find out that the president of the United States was more than just encouraging from the sidelines, what happened here, and Republicans in Congress. And if we're going to move guard in some sense as a country, you must come to terms with a president of the United States who encouraged people who are walking around with t-shirts that said Camp Auschwitz, where one of the greatest horrors against humanity was committed. And I’m sorry, you can't have a process point which says, well, he's out of office.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: That's what I want to bring up --\n(CROSSTALK)\nEMANUEL: To Democrats, I would argue it's not just about the conviction. It's about focusing that he can never run again for office and that that is because of what he's done. And he has to both be morally judged and then politically and legally judged.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And that could be a resolution on the 14th Amendment.\nChris Christie, let me bring that question to you. It does seem like more and more Senate Republicans are coalescing around this argument, a process argument that it's not constitutional to try a former president. Is that enough of an exit ramp?\nCHRISTIE: Well, we're going to see, George, based upon what Rahm just said, depending upon on the facts. Again, I go back to let’s see what the facts are.\nBut we also need to remember here, too, and this is going to be the challenge for President Biden in terms of bringing the country together. All of the things that Rahm said were absolutely right, in terms of what happened up on Capitol Hill. It's inexcusable. I said that I though that it was impeachable, and that these things are just wrong.\nBut also, the violence that's happening in other parts of the country are wrong, too, George, and the president needs to speak out about both. You can’t just continue to talk about what happened on Capitol Hill which deserves to be spoken about, and all the facts need to come out and those responsible need to be held responsible criminally and politically.\nBut so does the violence that's happening in other parts of the country, George. We can't allow that to be two different standards.\nSo, one of the challenges for the president is going for him to speak clearly when there are other violent act that continue to go on in the country and to be able to say, that's wrong, too, peaceful protests is one thing. Violence that destroys lives, destroys property, and destroys the peaceful enjoyment of our country is also wrong, just as wrong as what happened on Capitol Hill on January because it affects those citizens who live on those places.\nAnd I know, Rahm, you've had plenty of time to talk this morning. Let me finish. If we want fairness and we want unity in the country, and let's have fairness and unity and have comments on everything that's happening in this country, not just that very awful incident which I think many Republicans have denounced including me.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Rahm?\nEMANUEL: What I would say here, first of all, the president has spoken that there's no place for violence, but what I will reject that somehow happened in Portland is morally equivalent to a Confederate flag and 6 million is not enough. One is defending the constitution and our country, the organizing principles and values of this country and also prosecuting people who committed property crimes. And if you draw moral equivalence, you're morally loss.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Margaret?\nCHRISTIE: You’re not morally loss, excuse me --\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Hold on.\nMARGARET HOOVER, HOST, PBS “FIRING LINE”: What I’m looking forward in the Biden administration, the cessation of the what-aboutism that we had we were so addicted to in the Trump era. Well, if they're doing this, what about this?\nYou know what? Let's not do what-abouts. Let's separate them.\nThere was an insurrection on the Capitol that the president of the United States actually encouraged and -- and -- and pointed his supporters to. We can deal with that in its own vessel and then separately deal with other act of violence. They are separate. There is no what about-ism here. And we can do that. We can do all of it.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Chris?\nHOOVER: And -- and what I will say about the impeachment is -- is just give it time to have a fair and -- and timely and open, transparent process. And the American people and the Senate may very well do exactly the right thing, which is truth and justice that can then lead to reconciliation.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Chris?\nCHRIS CHRISTIE, FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR AND ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, this is not about moral equivalence. And Rahm knows better than that.\nThe fact is, for the people in Portland, for the people in other places in this country who have seen their cities and their neighborhoods destroyed and disrupted, their constitutional rights are being violated as well. And so there are constitutional arguments to be made on both sides. And it's not about making the two of them equivalent. What I'm saying is that a president of the United States who says he wants to unite the country, has to talk about both of them and has to talk about them not just this broad sense of violence is bad --\nRAHM EMANUEL, FORMER CHICAGO MAYOR AND ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Agreed.\nCHRISTIE: But then squawk about -- speak about all of the rest of that. And I think that's what I'm talking about. And a real president who wants to unite the country will do that.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Matt?\nEMANUEL: George --\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Let Matt go and you talk.\nMATTHEW DOWD, ABC NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: So, I'll -- listen, I'm not saying this, that Chris is doing this, but that it is incredibly frustrating to listen to so many Republicans talk about, why isn't Biden talking about this, I mean why isn't Biden, and we need unity, and we need healing, and we need fiscal level of responsibility. I mean it is the triple crown, American Pharaoh level of hypocrisy and dishonesty after what we've witnessed the last four years in division, in polarization and no condemning of white supremacists and white nationalists throughout -- throughout many Republicans who enabled this. So just give me a break about calling Joe Biden out for any of this right now because of what happened over the last four years.\nEMANUEL: Yes, George, I would say, look --\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Rahm.\nEMANUEL: The impeachment, as I -- Margaret said, and I agree, let it happen. You're going to -- the facts are going to come out. And I think the American people are going to make a judgment. We will have its own political imperative.\nAnd, second, to -- a compliment to what I think President Biden's done, he is focusing -- he's concentrated. He's -- and he's showing capability around COVID. And that is where there is consensus in the sense of urgency that the country is -- got to be focused on. And the country's rallying behind Biden because they know if he succeeds in all this, their lives are going to get better.\nAnd that's why, in fact, it's more than just a honeymoon. It is a real turn of a page and contrast to a White House that was, at one time, a super spreader event and a White House that was literally hocking different kinds of crazy theories of medications that could help. And that is the return to normalcy that Biden presents and he is in perfect ways still actually debating Donald Trump and it's working.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Chris, is getting -- Chris, we have 30 seconds left.\nHOOVER: Rahm --\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Is getting something done beast for both sides on COVID?\nCHRISTIE: Yes, it is.\nHOOVER: Yes. Well, getting something done is good for both --\nEMANUEL: Yes.\nCHRISTIE: Getting something done (INAUDIBLE) both sides for COVID because -- because -- because, George, that's what the American people want. But what the American people also they want is to make sure they have a president who truly wants to unify the country and speaks to all of it. And that's not comparing it to before. That's Joe Biden trying to reach the goal he set out in his inaugural speech on Wednesday. And I hope he does it.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And that is all we have time for.\nHOOVER: Big idea for Joe (INAUDIBLE).\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: That's all for us today.

We’ve addressed this specifically in previous posts (we encourage you to check that out!), including the fact we are likely 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 COVID-19 deaths. However, another important factor to consider is that mortality is not the only consequence of COVID-19. Even amongst those that survive the illness, many are left with persistent and debilitating sequelae. Long-term effects of COVID-19 can affect anyone, even the young and otherwise healthy. They include ongoing fatigue, respiratory issues, headaches, anosmia, renal impairment, psychiatric disturbances, and cardiovascular issues. Lung damage has been well-characterized in both acute and convalescent COVID-19 patients. Chest X-rays of COVID-19 patients are often characterized by a combination of multifocal peripheral lung changes of ground glass opacity (GGO) and/or consolidation, which are most commonly bilateral, may be present. GGO is the most common finding in COVID-19 infections. Lung damage is being reported in 50-80% of COVID-19 patients, and many clinicians have attested to the fact that the lung damage that is observed is more substantial than people who have smoked for years. While we don’t yet know the extent of these sequelae and how long they may persist, many clinicians have reported this type of lung scarring is present far beyond the initial recovery from acute COVID-19. Many experts have voiced concerns that this type of damage may persist for years. More than that, even people who had relatively mild COVID-19 primary illness have been struck with these long-term consequences, indicating that severity of disease is not the only factor in whether symptoms persist. These findings underscore the fact that COVID-19 carries with it much more complexity than either death or survival. Even amongst those who recover, there are substantial and potentially permanent consequences. As such, it should not be taken lightly, even if you consider yourself low risk. The small risks of side effects from the vaccines we have available pale in comparison to the very real risks of COVID-19.\""}, {"claim": "The 'Act Of 1871'  Establish The United States As A Corporation That Owns Its Residents.", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Refuted", "justification": "Relates to infrastructure and services with no mention of residents.", "claim_date": "20-1-2021", "speaker": null, "original_claim_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210304071052/https://themarshallreport.wordpress.com/2021/01/20/trump-ode-to-the-corporation/", "fact_checking_article": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210304071052/https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2021/01/fact-check-act-of-1871-did-not-establish-the-united-states-as-a-corporation.html", "reporting_source": "The Marshall Report", "location_ISO_code": "US", "claim_types": ["Event/Property Claim"], "fact_checking_strategies": ["Written Evidence"], "questions": [{"question": "What parts of the United States does the act of 1871 refer to?", "answers": [{"answer": "that part of the territory of the United States included within the limits of the District of Columbia", "answer_type": "Extractive", "source_url": "https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/41st-congress/session-3/c41s3ch62.pdf", "source_medium": "PDF"}]}, {"question": "What does it mean when a city is incorporated?", "answers": [{"answer": "Incorporated towns and cities will have a government body with a mayor, city council, clerks and other positions – all integral decision makers for the corporation.", "answer_type": "Extractive", "source_url": "https://www.newbedfordguide.com/started-in-established-in-incorporated-in-why-are-some-towns-and-cities-unincorporated/2018/12/07", "source_medium": "Web text"}]}], "orig_claim": "The United States is a corporation formed in 1871 to strip residents of their rights.", "orig_verdict": "Not A Corp", "fulltext": "D.C. is fenced off and the President is never going back to the White House. But not for reasons you may be thinking.\nFear not, there will be a new capitol built and an end to income taxes paid to the tax collectors of the Corporation that is now in the hands of a new administration. They went to all the trouble to steal a corporation whose assets are in the process of being seized. Most did not see this coming for they did not even know their nation was a Corporation. But, it is indeed but now, no more are the states subject to it. Please read on to understand the nature of the battle we are in.\nIn 1871 a sedious act was performed by the Government. A coup was made to rewrite the constitution and put WE THE PEOPLE in all capitals, under a new corporate contract transferring the United States of America into the new Corporation of the United States of America which transferred the power of We The People and the constitution over to the new corporation. When they did that, it placed the citizens in the United States as property of the Corporation which was centered in Washington D.C.. This action made Washington D.C. a FOREIGN ENTITY on American soil of sovereign states. It was established through a loan from the Vatican when D.C. was transferred into a city-state, and this corporate entity then ruled over the people. Citizens rights were taken from them in this process. No one realized this.\nWhen they did the broker deal to get the loan from the Vatican, they did so via the Bank of London. At that time, they transferred all the property in D.C. Columbia over to the Corporate entity of D.C. a foreign corporation. (See BACK STORY below in this article).\nThe forming of this corporation in D.C. is of major importance to understand, for when President Trump signed an executive order in 2018 on Election Interference/Fraud for entities both foreign and domestic, it outlined how assetts would be seized. The President and the people knew and had the proof that a coup transpired out of the Corporation of the United States of America along with other foreign nations and was ignored by the Corporation in D.C.. They continued with their illegal steal, and the military is now in the process of seizing the assets of this foreign country known as THE CORPORATION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. It appears that President Trump’s executive order was actually directed at the Washington D.C. corporate swamp/cabal all along. D.C. is now walled in and filled with military guard.\nPresident Donald J. Trump has moved out permanently for he cannot be president over a Sovereign Nation in a Foreign land, which is what the White House and Capitol are. President Trump was voted in by We The People. Not the Corporation.\nAfter Donald J. Trump exits the White House, D.C. will be locked down because it will not be possible for a foreign ruler to rule over a sovereign country, therefore, the foreign ruler must be locked out. In this case, that would be this new administration.\nNow you see what is meant by Lin Wood’s shouts that we are in the second revolution.\nWe are literally watching the reclaiming of the United States of America. What this means for We The People is many things. One of them is no more IRS. Watch and see how this plays out. It is a genius move. God is in charge of this nation and is now leading his elect to restore this great nation called by his name.\nBACK STORY:\nThe City of London (that is the square mile within Greater London) is not technically part of Greater London or England, just as Vatican City is not part of Rome or Italy. Likewise, Washington DC is not part of the United States that it controls. These three entities have one goal and that is to do away with the old world order of sovereign nations and usher in a new global world order under one government rule under the iron fist of the cabal.\nThese sovereign, corporate entities have their own laws and their own identities.They also have their own flags. Seen below is the flag of Washington DC. Note the three stars, representing the trinity of these three city-states, also known as the Empire of the City. (There is also high esoteric significance to the number 3.)\nThe government of the United States, Canada and Britain are all subsidiaries of the crown, as is the Federal Reserve in the U.S.. The ruling Monarch in England is also subordinate to the Crown. The global financial and legal system is controlled from the City of London by the Crown.\nThe square mile making up the center of Greater London is the global seat of power, at least at the visible level.\nWashington DC was established as a city-state in 1871 with the passage of the Act of 1871, which officially established the United States as a corporation under the rule of Washington, which itself is subservient to the City of London.\nCorporations are run by presidents, which is why we call the person perceived to hold the highest seat of power in the land “the president.”\nThe fact is the president is nothing more than a figurehead for the central bankers and transnational corporations (both of which themselves are controlled by High Ecclesiastic Freemasonry) that really control this country and ultimately call the shots.\nWashington DC operates under a system of Roman Law and outside of the limitations established by the U.S. Constitution.The Unholy Trinity of Globalist Control: The Vatican, The City of London & Washington D.C. – (awakeandaware.ca)\nWashington D.C. Flag\nVatican Flag\nThe Papal States are the territories on the East Coast of the former United States under the sovereign direct rule of the pope, from the fall of the United States around the turn of the twentieth century to the present. The Papal States are one of the regional powers of the Chesapeake Bay, controlling the city of Washington, as well as much of the surrounding area. Several towns, baronies, and other holdings outside Washington are also held by the pope, creating an intricate network of holdings which pay tribute directly to the pope.\nThe Papal States were born out of the former United States, viewed by the modern world as an ancient empire and continent spawning government. Following a violent coup in Washington, the Papal States were established by Chester Hale Fitzgerald, built on the beliefs of a new religion, which would later become Unionism. The Pope claims however that his power originates from the American Empire, which supposedly granted the first pope complete power over the empire via the Donation of Lincoln, a forged American imperial decree. The document has since been used in support of claims of political authority by the papacy. Know your history…read more here: https://althistory.fandom.com/wiki/Papal_States_(Days_After_Chaos)\nFlag of the City of London\nSo how are these three cities ultimately connected? We must first go back to the Knights Templar and their initial 200-year reign of power. You see this in the flag of the City of London. Read about the flags of all Foreign entities here: https://awakeandaware.ca/the-unholy-trinity-of-globalist-control-the-vatican-the-city-of-london-washington-d-c/\nIn Conclusion: The Corporation called Washington D.C. is now a foreign entity on American soil of sovereign states. It was established through a loan from the Vatican when D.C. was transferred into a city state and this corporate entity. It is now under seige for interferring with the elections of We The People of the United States along with the Vatican and the other foreign nations who interfered, such as Germany, Italy, China, et al. They are now an enemy of the state and their assets shall be seized.

Go and look at the History of the IRS and whether they actually have the legal right to levy personal taxes. Corporate taxes – yes. I did see this many years ago and wondered why citizens in the USA still pay personal income tax. Other countries followed the idea of personal taxes and made it firm in their laws but I recall the US never actually did that step and thus you may not be obligated to pay. You are led to believe you must pay, but is that actually law?\nLikeLike\nAbsolutely Amazing!\nLikeLike\nI have heard all this but this is a good summary of all that is wrong in our land.

Understandably, the way a school student might memorize and deliver the famous line, “A government of the people, by the people and for the people shall not perish,” yields a passing grade. Presidents and even Hillsdale College radio ads have done nothing to reflect the conclusion of the study. I contacted Hillsdale and made several efforts to bring attention to national talk show hosts’ findings to no satisfactory avail. Without proof of the findings, here is what was reported by a brilliant speaker by the name of W Carl Ketcherside decades ago:\nSince hearing a statement only or reading it does not always satisfy our curiosity, an effort was made to trace the famous speech to someone who actually heard the Gettysburg Address. The conclusion was that Lincoln emphasized the word PEOPLE, clearly defining the PEOPLE as having power over government. That’s why in a political setting, when writing (as on Facebook), I always write the word in all capitals to reflect the conclusion of the study.\nThese comments were made possible after reading “Trump Ode to the Corporation.” I wish that Trump would be the first to quote Lincoln using the tonality said to be Lincoln’s. Anything less seems weak. If not, maybe “The Marshall Report” could do the honors to get the suggestion out en-mass. My website http://www.simplelifetruths.com lists Ketcherside’s website on the “Coming Soon” page as one of the best websites for a special study of the six major areas of life.\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nReblogged this on Hālau 'Aha Hūi Lanakila™.\nLikeLike"}, {"claim": "Arm Rash After Pfizer Vaccine is Harmless", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Supported", "justification": "The 1st Q&A pair point out that the claim is right about a rash after a pfizer covid shot, the 2nd Q&A pair states that the rash is harmless and also rare. thus agreeing with the claim.", "claim_date": "20-1-2021", "speaker": null, "original_claim_url": "https://alkhaleejonline.net/%D9%85%D8%AC%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B9/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B6-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%AE%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%85%D9%82%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%B9%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%B1%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AB%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9", "fact_checking_article": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210228062159/https://misbar.com/en/factcheck/2021/01/31/covid-arm-rash-after-moderna-vaccine-is-harmless", "reporting_source": "Gulf Online", "location_ISO_code": "US", "claim_types": ["Event/Property Claim"], "fact_checking_strategies": ["Written Evidence"], "questions": [{"question": "Is a rash on the arm a side effect of the Pfizer vaccine?", "answers": [{"answer": "Soreness and swelling at the injection site are common reactions to the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines.

الجرعتين من شركة \"فايزر\" أكد أن الثانية كانت أعراضها أقوى.\nهل الأعراض التي ظهرت بعد الجرعة الثانية خطيرة؟\nوفق تأكيدات طبية فهي غير خطيرة وتذهب بعد ساعات.\nبعد فترة وجيزة من حصول أطباء وكبار في السن بدول الخليج على التطعيم الخاص بفيروس كورونا بدأت تظهر أعراض جانبية للقاح، تفاوتت صعوبتها من دولة لأخرى ومن أشخاص لآخرين.\nوظهرت الأعراض الجانبية للتطعيم مع حصول الأطباء في دولة الكويت تحديداً على الجرعة الثانية من لقاح للقاح \"فايزر-بيونتيك\" الذي أجازته الجهات المختصة في بريطانيا، الشهر الماضي.\nوتعد دول مجلس التعاون الخليجي في طليعة دول العالم التي جلبت لقاحات كورونا وبدأت بحملات التطعيم الوطنية على مواطنيها وسكانها، وفق خطط ومحددات زمنية.\nوحصل زعماء ومسؤولو الصحة في دول الخليج على لقاحات كورونا كخطوة تشجيعية ومطمئنة للمواطنين والسكان من أجل الحصول على التطعيم.\nوكان أمير دولة قطر، الشيخ تميم بن حمد، والعاهل السعودي سلمان بن عبد العزيز، وولي عهده محمد بن سلمان، والعاهل البحريني حمد بن عيسى آل خليفة، والشيخ محمد بن راشد آل مكتوم، نائب رئيس الإمارات رئيس مجلس الوزراء حاكم دبي، أبرز قادة الخليج الذين حصلوا على اللقاح.\nواعتمدت غالبية دول الخليج لقاح شركتي \"فايزر\" و\"بايونتيك\" الألمانية والأمريكية في تطعيم مواطنيها وسكانها، حيث أظهرت البيانات ونتائج الدراسات أن الآثار الجانبية للقاح اقتصرت على آلام في مكان الحقنة، والتعب، وآلام في الرأس والعضلات والمفاصل.\nوصمم لقاح شركة \"فايزر- بيونتيك\" لتحفيز الجهاز المناعي للجسم لإنتاج الأجسام المضادة لفيروس \"كوفيد-19\" ومحاربته على نحو مأمون، وسيكون عبارة عن جرعتين يفصل بينهما 21 يوماً.\nظهور الأعراض\nرئيس لجنة الإشهاد التابعة لمنظمة الصحة العالمية بالكويت، الطبيب فهد العنزي، كان من الأطباء الذين حصلوا على جرعتين من لقاح \"فايزر-بايونتيك\"، ولكن بدأت تظهر أعراض عليه بعد الجرعة الثانية.\nوفي حديثه لـ\"الخليج أونلاين\" يؤكد العنزي أنه شعر بصعوبة في المشي بعد حصوله على الجرعة الثانية من اللقاح، وبألم في العضلات، وصداع.\nوفي عرضه لما حصل معه بعد حصوله على الجرعة الثانية يوضح العنزي أن عدداً كبيراً من الأطباء في الكويت من الذين حصلوا على الجرعة الثانية شعروا بأعراض، ومنهم من لم يتمكن من الذهاب إلى عمله.\nوكان يجب الحديث عن أعراض اللقاح، وفق العنزي، وذلك \"من باب الشفافية العالية، ووضع الناس في حقيقة ما يحدث، ولكن ذلك لا يعني ألا يتلقوا اللقاح؛ لكون أعراضه أخف من مشاكل فيروس كورونا نفسه\".\nويستدرك بالقول لـ\"الخليج أونلاين\": \"لا توجد أمانة كاملة للقاح، فحتى الماء حين يتم شربه قد يسبب مشاكل في الكلى، وكذلك اللقاحات، لذلك يجب على المرضى والناس أن تكون لديهم ثقة في لقاحات كورونا لكونها تعطيهم مناعة من المرض\".\nويستبعد رئيس لجنة الإشهاد التابعة لمنظمة الصحة العالمية بالكويت أن يتراجع الناس عن تلقي لقاحات كورونا بسبب الأعراض، خاصة بعد حصولهم على مناعة ضد المرض، وهو ما سيشجع الكثيرين على أخذ التطعيم.\nوإلى جانب ما كشفه العنزي، أكدت الدكتورة سهى البيات، مديرة قسم التطعيمات بوزارة الصحة القطرية، أن هناك آثاراً جانبية بسيطة لأشخاص حصلوا على لقاح كورونا.\nومن الأعراض التي تم التبليغ عنها في قطر، وفق حديث العنزي لإذاعة قطر، السبت 2 يناير، ارتفاع طفيف في درجة الحرارة، وألم خفيف بمكان الإبرة.\nوفي الإمارات تسببت اللقاحات التي حصل عليها سكان الدولة بظهور أعراض جانبية؛ كان منها صداع أو وهن عام، وفقاً لتصريح الباحثة الرئيسية للتجارب السريرية للقاحات، والمديرة الطبية التنفيذية في مدينة الشيخ خليفة الطبية، الدكتورة نوال الكعبي.\nوفي البحرين أيضاً ظهرت أعراض جانبية على الأشخاص الذين حصلوا على لقاح سينوفارم الصيني؛ وكان منها ألم في مكان الحقنة، والصداع، وارتفاع درجات الحرارة، والشعور بالتعب، حسب تأكيدات الدكتورة مريم الجلاهمة، الرئيسة التنفيذية للهيئة الوطنية لتنظيم المهن والخدمات الصحية عضوة الفريق الوطني الطبي للتصدي لفيروس كورونا في البحرين.\nووفق حديث الجلاهمة خلال مؤتمر صحفي لوزارة الصحة البحرينية، في نهاية ديسمبر الماضي، أكدت أن الأعراض استمرت ساعات أو 24 ساعة على الأكثر.\nوعلى عكس الكويت وقطر والإمارات والبحرين، لم تبلغ وزارت الصحة في السعودية أو سلطنة عُمان عن ظهور أعراض جانبية للأشخاص الذين تلقوا لقاحات ضد كورونا.\n\"فايزر\" توضح\nوأمام الأعراض الجانبية التي ظهرت في دول الخليج وغيرها بعد حصول سكانها على لقاحات كورونا المختلفة، خاصة الجرعة الثانية، أكدت شركة \"فايزر\" أن الأعراض الجانبية للجرعة الثانية طفيفة وعابرة.\nوحسب بيان للشركة فإن أعراض الجرعة الثانية تظهر غالباً بعد يوم أو اثنين من تلقي التطعيم، والأعراض الأكثر انتشاراً هي ألم في مكان التطعيم، وإرهاق، وصداع، وألم في العضلات، وقشعريرة، وألم مفاصل، وارتفاع حرارة الجسد أحياناً.\nمدير قسم الأمراض المعدية بمستشفى \"ساكو\" في مدينة ميلانيو الإيطالية، ماسيمو غاللي، توقَّع ظهور آثار جانبية للقاح المضاد لـ\"كوفيد-19\" خلال 10 سنوات.\nولا يوجد علاج أو لقاح، حسب حديث غاللي لوكالة \"آكي\" الإيطالية، لن يؤذي من يتناوله خلال 10 سنوات بعد الحصول عليه.\nوسيتناول غاللي لقاح كورونا -كما يؤكد- في حالة توافره، مع حديثه عن وجود بعض الآثار الجانبية له."}, {"claim": "Philippines Senator Panfilo

That really hurts,\" he said.\nHe added, there is also a possibility that it will infringe on the academic freedom of the premiere state university.\n\"We don’t know how they will implement the termination or how deep they will infiltrate the UP campuses all over the country.

While our veterans lay homeless on our streets and our corporations are being threatened with higher taxes, Democrats have decided to fund a known enemy to the US.\nThis is the very definition of treason. Not even bleeding heart Jimmy Carter sank so low in his dealings with Iran.\nThe jet, handpicked by Biden’s Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, is a Dassault Falcon 8X. While the Dassault made its name in the military and commercial aircraft space, the larger Falcon jets carved out a niche in the business space due to their impressive range (5,950 nautical miles), a digital flight control system, and an ability to customize the plane’s interiors into 30+ formats depending on usage priorities.\nWith the versatility to make both long-range and short-range trips courtesy of a tri-jet engine, the Falcon models offer speed, efficiency, and improved comfort. Sources tell us there will be a handwritten note from Biden on top of the cash that will simply say, “Enjoy the cash. Keep the Jet.”\nDue to its payload, this flight will take on a particular significance in aeronautic history. It will be the most valuable payload ever transported by aircraft. To bear this grave responsibility, Bilken enlisted retired US Airways pilot Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger, famed pilot depicted by the legendary Tom Hanks in the 2016 blockbuster hit “Sully”.\nSullenberger insisted his longtime personal flight steward Andres Esquer be along for the all-important flight. Esquer famously served an entire Boeing 777 full of rowdy Oasis fans two cocktails each from one single liter of vodka on an international flight from Heathrow to JFK in 1998, a feat that is still mentioned during pillow talk amongst flight attendants and pilots to this day.\nHe is certified in CPR and BJJ. He is also an amateur pilot, more than capable of manhandling the aircraft should anything unfortunate befall Sully.\nThe offer of cash as an apology only serves to lessen our standing in the world. The only silver lining here is that it is being delivered by the best America has to offer.\nBe the first to comment"}, {"claim": "Georgia County Meant to order 25 million voter applications after the 2020 election.", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Refuted", "justification": "The applications were sent in error", "claim_date": "18-1-2021", "speaker": "Jovan Hutton Pulitzer", "original_claim_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210223022357/https://twitter.com/JovanHPulitzer/status/1351190778387824640", "fact_checking_article": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210304062256/https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2021/01/fact-check-georgia-county-meant-to-order-250-thousand-individual-voter-applications-not-25-million.html", "reporting_source": "Twitter", "location_ISO_code": "US", "claim_types": ["Numerical Claim", "Event/Property Claim"], "fact_checking_strategies": ["Written Evidence"], "questions": [{"question": "Why Did Georgia County order 25 million voter applications?", "answers": [{"answer": "They were ordered in error.

The mRNA directs the synthesis of proteins, which occurs in the cytoplasm. mRNA formed in the nucleus is transported out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm where it attaches to the ribosomes. Proteins are assembled on the ribosomes using the mRNA nucleotide sequence as a guide. Thus mRNA carries a “message” from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

His largest holdings are in Louisiana (69,071 acres), Arkansas (47,927 acres) and Nebraska (20,588 acres). Additionally, he has a stake in 25,750 acres of transitional land on the west side of Phoenix, Arizona, which is being developed as a new suburb.\nAccording to The Land Report’s research, the land is held directly and through third-party entities by Cascade Investments, Gates’ personal investment vehicle. Cascade’s other investments include food-safety company Ecolab, used-car retailer Vroom and Canadian National Railway.\nWhile it may be surprising that a tech billionaire would also be the biggest farmland owner in the country, this is not Gates’ only foray into agriculture. In 2008, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced $306 million in grants to promote high-yield, sustainable agriculture among smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The foundation has further invested in the development and proliferation of “super crops” resistant to climate change and higher-yield dairy cows. Last year, the organization announced Gates Ag One, a nonprofit to advance those efforts.\nIt is not entirely clear how Gates’ farmland is being used, or whether any of the land is being set aside for conservation. (Cascade did not return Forbes’ request for comment.) However, there is some indication that the land could be used in a way that aligns with the foundation’s values. Cottonwood Ag Management, a subsidiary of Cascade, is a member of Leading Harvest, a nonprofit that promotes sustainable agriculture standards that prioritize protections of crops, soil and water resources.\nGates is not the only billionaire on The Land Report’s list of top private farmland owners. Wonderful Company cofounders Stewart and Lynda Resnick (net worth: $7.1 billion) ranked number three with 190,000 acres. Their farmland produces the goods for their brands including POM Wonderful, Wonderful Pistachios and Wonderful Halos mandarins.\nWhile Gates may be the country’s biggest farmland owner, he by no means is the largest individual landowner. In its list of 100 top American landowners, The Land Report gives the top spot to Liberty Media Chair John Malone, who owns 2.2 million acres of ranches and forests. CNN founder Ted Turner ranked number three with 2 million acres of ranch land across eight states. Even Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is investing in land on a large scale, landing the 25th spot with his ownership of 420,000 acres, mainly in west Texas.\nI am a wealth reporter at Forbes covering billionaires who made their money in media, tech and retail.

Berger late Monday night, and she beseeched him to commit 5,000 troops to help ensure a peaceful transition of power and to prevent a repeat of the Jan 6 siege of the Capitol. Gen. Berger, our source said, didn’t understand why Pelosi needed additional soldiers to augment an already impressive force assembled by federal and state officials. That force includes 15,000 National Guard from D.C., Delaware, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, and an undisclosed number of FBI and DHS agents who arrived in D.C. Sunday night.\nPelosi said she wanted “battle ready” reinforcements because “radicalized Trump supporters and kooky Qanon conspiracy people” were about to converge on D.C. She implored him to reconsider, arguing that it was the general’s patriotic duty to quell uprisings and guarantee Biden’s ascension to the Oval Office.\nHer statement made the general explode, our source said.\n“Don’t lecture me on patriotism, Madam Speaker. I’ve served this country with distinction for 40 years. I’ve spilled blood for our nation. What have you, a self-serving elected official, done for your country?” Gen. Berger said.\nPelosi further enraged him by saying he was answerable to Congress.\n“I answer only to the president, and as I understand it, Donald J. Trump is still president and commander-in-chief. I abide in the Constitution as it was written, not your interpretation of it,” Gen. Berger admonished Pelosi.\nQuoting our source, “When her intimidation tactic failed to sway Gen. Berger, Pelosi tried a different tactic: Begging and flattery.”\nPelosi claimed that the National Guard’s “weekend warriors” were ill-prepared to repel an army of “mad Trumpists.” Battle-hardened marines, however, were more capable of defeating “rabble rousers,” she said. “You have the best trained soldiers in the world, and America needs them.”\nGen. Berger was unmoved. The only way Marines would be deployed, he told her, was if President Trump himself issued that order.\n“If you want us to help combat his supporters, I suggest you get him on the phone and tell him that. If he orders me to, I will. Otherwise, I suggest you listen really hard to the words escaping your cracked, poisonous lips; they’re tantamount to treason. We don’t work for you,” Gen. Berger allegedly told her.\nPlease help support alternative media. We follow the truth, wherever it leads. We reject absolutely big-tech and the narrow, dogmatic views of MSM.

Not to mention, “What and INSULT to ALL the Troops that did come to protect the Capital Inauguration, to call them incompetent, weekend soldiers”! How despicable she REALLY is! As for Mike…G’s response, I can only say, “If you ever served in the Marine Corps, you would know this is True! I’m sure the General knows what will happen to all the REAL Leaders, now that the Socialist Regime is taking over!! History tells it like it is!\nI see you did not approve my comments because you got called out for lying. The General is not even wearing a purple heart so how was he wounded? If really had 40 years in he would have hot mandatory retirement age and Pelosi would not violate chain of command and beyond the chief of Staff….and having been an airborne infantry officer to make the statement that the marines are the best trained….no one would agree with you except marines.\nPelosi would never talk to the Commandant of the Marine Corps when she can talk to the Chair of the Joint Chiefs. This is as stupid as saying she called the commander of the 82nd Airborne directly. Also, if you idiots looked at your picture you posted of the General he does not have a Purple Heart. What idiots. Then you wonder why real veterans can suss out the bullshit.\nWhat a loser she is, all pumped up in her own little world,\nno self-control of her own ego\nA Marine Corps spokeswoman called the article “unequivocally false and inaccurate,” and Pelosi’s office said the claim about her is spurious.\nhttps://factcheck.afp.com/us-marine-corps-commandant-did-not-berate-nancy-pelosi-over-inauguration-security #factcheck #fakenews\nHaving known several generals throughout my life and I lived with General Schwarzkopf’s mother-in-law while attending university; I would not be surprised at all if that was said.\nDonald Trump is no longer our President. So I hope this Marine, if this article isn’t just made up (which the lack of a source strongly suggests), now accepts that they take orders from Joe Biden now. You say in a response to another comment that you stand by your sources, bur you provide no sources. It’s clickbait and intentionally divisive, and I’m calling you out on it.\nBut what else can be said on a site that said that “martial law is imminent” a few days ago (a link that is still live on this page) when no such thing happened?\nYou are an untrustworthy site, and “realrawnews dot com” is a site I will never click a link to again, because you are just looking to divide people with lies.\nI dont think he sees her as a person in authority to him. He already knows she is guilty of treason and is the enemy. She can’t do anything to him from her cell.\nI can believe it of pelosi, she is that stupid…..\nI love it!

Yes some Trump supporters were swept up by mob mentality, but it wasn’t Trump supporters who broke anything, the Trump supporters were the ones walking between the velvet ropes while entering, while the antifa BLM thugs went outside the ropes running around like hyenas.\nI love it.

A State’s national guard has a duel role that some people seem to get a bit confused about. But only two people have the authority to call out a guard unit. One is the Governor of the involved State for a State function. And the other is the Commander in Chief (President) for a federal function. Would need to know more about the procedures that were followed to activate these guard units but something does seem screwy about these guard units bein in DC. Whose authority are they acting on to start with? And who do they answer to? When guard units are augmenting local law enforcement they are suppose to be under the authority of local enforcement agency and answerable to that agency.\nI work for the Government & to me it sounded just like a marine (semper fi) General! And it is Treason!\nPelosi should be arrested and tried for this wicked crime against the USA !\nShould have shot her on spot.\nThank goodness that we have real men on our side. Bless you for knowing right from wrong.\nShe a comm6\nThe good general probably would not speak to the lady house speaker like that…..normally! But when you have some american hating, child trafficking, CCP cunt like Pelosi trying to sweat you, one has to give him props for the restraint he presented to this self serving cunt who used to be nothing but a fender lizard for a hot rod magazine!\nAre Americans really good at Biden as their next representative? Is the result of a mail ballot that you don’t know who issued it the intention of Americans?\nNo one can be trusted except our President.\nI would like to see the video or hear the audio if it’s at all possible ?\nWith 70 m american voter not happy and the fact of inpechment of their leader.

Thank you, Amen.\nI’m a US Navy veteran and I saw our Captain give the finger t the operator of a sailboat who cut him off on the way out of San Diego Harbor. Not quite the same level, but General Berger’s alleged remarks are definitely credible.\nDon’t refer to Marines as “soldiers.” They’re Marines (always capitalized); “Soldiers” are in the Army.\nPelosi’s is complete with misquoting the Bible.

She has committed many crimes in Gods eyes.\nThey tried to pull a coup with the election and she’s trying to pull one here !!!\nFake news. Mrs. Pelosi doesn’t need Togo asking every separate armed forces to send troops. She asked for troops to protect the inauguration ceremonies directly from the Pentagon, and the Pentagon responded in kind. The “news” that you report cannot be confirmed by any other news media.

Pro-Trump rioters rampaged in the US Capitol last Wednesday. Five people died as a result of the chaos, including a US Capitol Police officer. House Democrats want to impeach Trump, accusing him of “incitement of insurrection.”\n“Recently, I was offered the opportunity to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which I was flattered by out of respect for what the honor represents and admiration for prior recipients,” Belichick said in a statement. “Subsequently, the tragic events of last week occurred and the decision has been made not to move forward with the award. Above all, I am an American citizen with great reverence for our nation’s values, freedom and democracy.”\nA White House official told CNN the White House was made aware of the decision.\nBelichick has been the Patriots’ head coach since 2000 and has won six Super Bowls, a NFL record for a head coach.\nIn 2016, he wrote a letter of support to Trump. He told reporters after Trump gushed about the letter: “Our friendship goes back many years. Anybody who spends more than five minutes with me knows I’m not a political person. My comments are not politically motivated. I have a friendship with Donald.”\nStill, Belichick had faced repeated calls to decline the Presidential Medal of Freedom given the President’s response to the US Capitol breach.\nMassachusetts Rep. Jim McGovern told CNN earlier Monday that Belichick should “refuse it.”\n“This President has made a mockery of the Presidential Medal of Freedom,” he said. “Look at who he is giving it to in the last weeks – people like Devin Nunes and Jim Jordan – I mean, please. Bill Belichick should do the right thing and say: ‘No thanks.’”\nTrump has often used the Medal of Freedom to reward his allies, whether they be financial, political or just old friends. Representatives Nunes and Jordan were two of the President’s most vocal political allies who defended him throughout his impeachment.\nSeveral people close to Trump have noted that, as his time in office comes to an end, one of the things he’ll likely miss the most is not the work of the presidency but the trappings that come with it: the motorcades, rides on Marine One, tours of the Lincoln Bedroom given to dinner guests, a constant press corps at his side – but also Medal of Freedom ceremonies.\nTrump often delights in them and has done so for multiple friends, political donors and athletes over the last four years.\nBelichick concluded his statement Monday acknowledging, “I also represent my family and the New England Patriots team.”\n“One of the most rewarding things in my professional career took place in 2020 when, through the great leadership within our team, conversations about social justice, equality and human rights moved to the forefront and became actions,” he said.\n“Continuing those efforts while remaining true to the people, team and country I love outweigh the benefits of any individual award.”\nThis story has been updated with additional information Monday.\nCNN’s Jim Acosta, Paul LeBlanc, Kaitlan Collins, Maegan Vazquez and David Close contributed to this report."}, {"claim": "The big tech companies (Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft) can determine everything that exists on the web.", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Refuted", "justification": "Jevin West, Director of the Center for an Informed Public said its a general misconception by the public ", "claim_date": "12-1-2021", "speaker": "Nicole Arbour", "original_claim_url": "https://www.facebook.com/ForAmerica/photos/a.320952984629733/4073263652731962", "fact_checking_article": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417113541/https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2021/01/fact-check-big-tech-is-not-protecting-child-porn-which-operates-on-dark-web.html", "reporting_source": "Facebook", "location_ISO_code": "US", "claim_types": ["Event/Property Claim"], "fact_checking_strategies": ["Consultation"], "questions": [{"question": "Can big tech companies (Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft) determine everything that exists on the web?", "answers": [{"answer": "Jevin West, Director of the Center for an Informed Public, a University of Washington research unit that studies online disinformation and misinformation. \"Most people think they (companies like Amazon and Google) own the internet.

Biden also addressed the riot at the Capitol, calling participants “domestic terrorists.” Read the transcript of the press conference announcement here.\nTranscribe Your Own Content\nTry Rev and save time transcribing, captioning, and subtitling.\nJoe Biden: (00:01)\nYou’re all going to have a lot of questions, but I want to focus on the issue today, the judiciary, as well as we were talking about the Attorney General’s office. And so I’ll have plenty of time to ask the questions I know you desperately want to ask about everything from 25th Amendment on, but I’m not going to speak to that today. I want this to be the issue that we focus on because I think it’s so important. Yesterday, in my view, one of the darkest days in the history of our nation, an unprecedented assault on our democracy. An assault, literally, on the citadel of liberty, on the United States Capitol itself. An assault on the rule of law. An assault on the most sacred of American undertakings, ratifying the will of the people in choosing the leadership of their government. All of us here grieve the loss of life, grieve the desecration of the people’s house. What we witnessed yesterday was not dissent. It was not disorder. It was not protest. It was chaos. They weren’t protesters. Don’t dare call them protesters. They were a riotous mob. Insurrectionists. Domestic terrorists. It’s that basic. It’s that simple. And I wish we could say we couldn’t see it coming, but that isn’t true. We could see it coming.\nJoe Biden: (01:52)\nThe past four years, we’ve had a president who’s made his contempt for our democracy, our constitution, the rule of law, clear in everything he has done. He unleashed an all-out assault on our institutions of our democracy from the outset. And yesterday was but the culmination of that unrelenting attack. He’s attacked the free press who dared to question his power, repeatedly calling the free press the enemy of the people. Language, at the time he first used it, I and others said has long been used by autocrats and dictators all over the world to hold onto power. The enemy of the people. Language that is being used now by autocrats and dictators across the world, only this time with the imperator of an outgoing President of the United States of America.\nJoe Biden: (02:51)\nHe’s attacked our intelligence services, who dare tell the American people the truth about the effort of a foreign power to elect him four years ago, choosing instead to believe the word of Vladimir Putin over the word of those who’ve sworn their allegiance to this nation, many of whom had risked their lives in the service of this nation.\nJoe Biden: (03:18)\nHe deployed the United States military, tear gassing peaceful protestors in pursuit of a photo opportunity in the service of his reelection, even holding the Bible upside down. The action that led to an apology from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and an outspoken denunciation of the use of military for domestic political purposes, from scores, scores of former military leaders and Secretaries of Defense, led by Secretary Cheney. He thought he could stack the courts with friendly judges who would support him no matter what, they were Trump judges, his judges. He went so far as to say he needed nine Justices on the Supreme court because he thought the election would end up in the Supreme Court and they would hand him the election.\nJoe Biden: (04:20)\nHe was stunned, truly stunned, when the judges he appointed didn’t do his bidding and instead acted with integrity, following the constitution, upholding the rule of law, not just once or twice or three times, but over 60 times. Let me say it, over 60 times. In more than 60 cases, in state after state after state, and then at the Supreme Court judges, including people considered “his judges”, Trump judges, to use his words, looked at the allegations that Trump was making determined they were without any merit.\nJoe Biden: (05:05)\nNothing was judged to put this election in question or doubt by any of these judges. You want to understand the importance of democratic institutions in this country, take a look at the judiciary in this nation. Take a look at the pressure it was just subjected to by a sitting president of the United States of America. At every level, the judiciary rose in the moment during this election, did its job, acted with complete fairness and impartiality, with complete honor and integrity. When history looks back in this moment that we’ve just passed through, I believe it will say our democracy survived in no small part because of the men and women who represent an independent judiciary in this nation. We owe them a deep, deep debt of gratitude.\nJoe Biden: (06:02)\nAnd then there’s the attack on the Department of justice, treating the Attorney General as his personal lawyer and the department as his personal law firm. Through it all, we would hear the same thing from this president, my generals, my judges, my Attorney General. And then yesterday, a culmination of an attack on our institutions of democracy. This time, the Congress itself. Inciting a mob to attack the Capitol, to threaten the elected representatives of the people of this nation, and even the vice president, to stop the Congress from ratifying the will of the American people in a just, completed, free and fair election.\nJoe Biden: (06:51)\nTrying to use a mob to silence the voices of nearly 160 million Americans who summoned the courage in the face of pandemic that threatened their health and their lives to cast that sacred ballot. I made it clear from the moment I entered this race that what I believe was at stake. I said there was nothing less at stake than who we are as a nation, what we stand for, what we believe, what we will be. At the center of that belief is one of the oldest principles this nation has long held, where our government of laws, not of men, not of the people, of laws. I said it many times in the campaign, our democratic institutions is not relics of another age, they’re what sets this nation apart. They’re the guardrails of our democracy. That’s why there is no president who is a King. No Congress that’s a House of Lords. A judiciary doesn’t serve the will of the president or exist to protect him or her. We have three co-equal branches of government. Co-equal. Our president is not above the law. Justice serves the people. It doesn’t protect the powerful. Justice is blind. What we saw yesterday, in plain view, was another violation of the fundamental tenet of this nation. Not only did we see the failure to protect one of the three branches of our government, we also saw a clear failure to carry out equal justice.\nJoe Biden: (08:57)\n[inaudible 00:08:57] used to say in the Senate, excuse a point of personal privilege. Well, over an hour and a half after the chaos started, I got a text from my granddaughter Finnegan Biden, who is a senior in her last semester at University of Pennsylvania. She sent me a photo of military people in full military gear, scores of them lining the steps of the Lincoln Memorial because of protest by Black Lives Matter. She said, “Pop, this isn’t fair.” No one can tell me that if it had been a group of Black Lives Matter protesting yesterday, they wouldn’t have been treated very, very differently than the mob of thugs that storm the Capitol. We all know that’s true and it is unacceptable. Totally unacceptable. The American people saw it in plain view. I hope it’s sensitizing what we have to do.\nJoe Biden: (10:12)\nNot many people know it, when Justice Garland and I were talking, we talked about, I think he raised it. The reason for the Justice Department’s forming in the first place. It was back in 1870. We didn’t have a Justice Department before that cabinet. It was formed in 1870 to enforce the civil rights amendment that grew out of the Civil War. The 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments. To stand up to the Klan, to stand up to racism, to take on domestic terrorism. This original spirit must again guide and animate it’s work.\nJoe Biden: (10:58)\nSo as we stand here today, we do so in the wake of yesterday’s events, events that could not more have vividly demonstrated some of the most important work we have to do in this nation. Committing ourselves to the rule of law in this nation. Invigorating our domestic and democratic institutions. Carrying out equal justice under the law in America. There is no more important place for us to do this work than the Department of Justice that has been so politicized. There’s no more important people to carry out this work than the people I’m announcing today. More than anything, we need to restore the honor, the integrity, the independence of Department of Justice in this nation that has been so badly damaged. And so many former leaders of that department in both parties have so testified and stated that.\nJoe Biden: (12:05)\nI want to be clear to those who lead this department, who you will serve. You won’t work for me. You are not the president or the vice president’s lawyer. Your loyalty is not to me. It’s to the law, the Constitution, the people of this nation, to guarantee justice. For Attorney General of the United States, I nominated a man of impeccable integrity, Judge Merrick Garland, one the most respected jurists of our time. Brilliant, yet humble. Distinguished, yet modest. Full of character and decency. The Supreme Court clerk served in the Justice Department during the Carter, Bush 41, and Clinton administrations, where he embraced the department’s core values of independence and integrity. A Federal prosecutor who took on terrorism and corruption and violent crime, always with the utmost professionalism and the duty to the oath he swore.\nJoe Biden: (13:24)\nNominated by President Clinton to be a judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, considered the second most powerful court in America. Throughout such a long and distinguished career, Judge Garland has earned the praise and admiration of members of bench and bar, and politicians of both parties. And despite his busy schedule and prestigious positions, he still makes time to volunteer regularly, tutoring students in Northeast DC, as he’s done for 20 years. It’s about character. It’s about character.\nJoe Biden: (14:02)\n… it’s about character, it’s about character. It was no surprise why President Obama nominated him, Judge Garland, to the Supreme Court. As I said he embodies honor, decency, integrity, fidelity to the rule of law and judicial independence. To those same traits, he will now bring as Attorney General of the United States, not as a personal attorney to the president, but as the peoples’ lawyer. He’ll restore trust in the rule of law and equal justice under the law. And I fully expect, in the discussions I’ve had, that he will receive a fair hearing and a swift confirmation. And once he’s confirmed, I will move promptly to nominate his replacement on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. I expect that the distinguished nominee will receive a prompt and fair hearing as well. For Deputy Attorney General, I nominate one of the most selfless people I’ve worked with, one of the brightest I’ve worked with. I worked with her during the last administration. A 15 year veteran of the Justice Department, Lisa Monaco. Lisa knows the department inside and out. She is a definition of what a public servant should be; decent, trusting, honorable. And I might add I embarrassed her a moment ago with her other colleagues, and selfless. I offered her other positions that are of “greater consequence,” more prestige. But she wanted to work with you, Judge. She wanted to go back to the Justice Department. A top [flight 00:15:47] prosecutor, took on public corruption, corporate fraud and violent crime. Chief of Staff to the Director of the FBI. The first woman ever confirmed as Assistant Attorney General for National Security, where she elevated cyber security to a top priority. And where it’s even more consequential today, than it was then.\nJoe Biden: (16:13)\nAt the White House, she was the top Homeland Security and Counter Terrorism advisor to President Obama and me, at every one of the national security meetings. She coordinated our fight against Al-Qaeda and ISIL. She helped lead our response to the Ebola Crisis. When the bombs went off at the finish line on Patriot’s Day in Boston, her hometown, she coordinated the Federal Governments response with local and state law enforcement to get to the bottom of the horrible tragedy. Lisa, I know, I know you will help restore integrity and independence of the Department of Justice that you so revere.\nJoe Biden: (16:57)\nAs Associate Attorney General, the number three job at the department, I nominate Vanita Gupta. A woman I’ve known for sometime. One of the most respected Civil Rights lawyers in America. Started a career at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Then onto to ACLU, both organizations to which I belong. And then to the Justice Department during the Obama-Biden administration, where she led the Civil Rights Division. At every step, with every case, she fought for greater equity and the right to right the wrongs of a justice system, where they existed. And she’s done so by bringing people together, earning praise from across the [etiological 00:17:51] spectrum for her approach to solving some of the thorniest problems we face.\nJoe Biden: (17:57)\nDuring the Obama-Biden administration, Vanita was put in charge of investigating the abuse of power in police departments in Ferguson, Missouri and other communities torn apart by acts of violence and racial injustice. She helped institute a common sense police reforms to build greater equity, safety, and trust. She was commended for her work by both law enforcement and those advocating for changes in the criminal justice system. That’s a rare achievement. And it speaks volumes about her capacity to unite people in common purpose, which is what this is all about. Uniting the American people.\nJoe Biden: (18:43)\nBorn in Pennsylvania, a proud daughter of immigrants from India, that sound familiar?\nSpeaker 1: (18:53)\n[inaudible 00:18:53]-\nJoe Biden: (18:55)\nIf confirmed, Vanita will be the first woman of color to serve as Associate Attorney General. And I’m grateful, I’m grateful that Vanita is leaving her current job, leading one of the premier Civil Rights organizations in the world, as she answers the call to serve once again to ensure that our justice system is even more fair, and more equitable. Thank you.\nJoe Biden: (19:22)\nFor Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, I nominate Kristen Clarke who has spent her career advocating for greater equality and equity in our justice system. The daughter of Jamaican immigrants. Now don’t think this has been designed here. I’m still looking for an Irishman. All kidding aside, the daughter of Jamaican immigrants, Kristen is also one of the most distinguished Civil Rights Attorneys in America. A proud native of Brooklyn, New York, she began her legal career in the very same office she’s now nominated to lead. Her previous tenure with the Justice Department saw her take on some of the most complex Civil Rights cases, from voting rights, to redistricting challenges, to prosecuting hate crimes and human trafficking. She’s earned accolades throughout her career, including as the head of the Civil Rights Bureau for her home state of New York, where she’s led the charge to end the school to prison pipeline and root out discrimination in housing and in law enforcement. She currently leads one of the nations top Civil Rights organizations, where she promotes greater equity, and voting rights, in our education system, in our housing system, in our justice system, and so much more.\nJoe Biden: (20:51)\nNow, she’ll return full circle to pursue the vital work where her career began. The Civil Rights division represents the moral center of the Department of Justice. And the heart of that fundamental American ideal that we’re all created equal and all deserve to be treated equally. I’m honored you accepted the call to return to make real the promise for all Americans.\nJoe Biden: (21:23)\nTo each of you, I thank you for your service, and to your families. And to the American people, this is a team that will restore your trust and faith in our institutions democracy. I chaired the judiciary committee for many years. One of my goals in running in the first place, you may recall, I said when I saw those people coming out of the fields on Charlottesville shouting hate, a young woman killed. And when asked the president said they there are good people on both sides. That’s literally why I ran. There’s no more important and heartfelt effort on my part than restoring, restoring the independence and integrity of our justice department.\nJoe Biden: (22:26)\nSo may God bless you all. May God protect our troops and those who are sworn to protect the American people. Now I will turn it over to the team, starting with the next Attorney General of the United States, Judge Merrick Garland. Thank you.\nMerrick Garland: (23:06)\nThank you President Elect Biden, Vice President Elect Harris, for asking me to serve as the Attorney General of the United States. Thanks always to my wife, children, sisters, late parents, without who’s unstinting support I would not be standing here today. Thanks also to my grandparents who’s decision to undertake the difficult journey to America made all things possible for my family.\nMerrick Garland: (23:39)\nIf confirmed, I look forward to working with these wonderful DOJ veterans. Lisa Monaco, Vanita Gupta, and Kristen Clarke. Entering the Department of Justice will be a kind of homecoming for me. My very first job after serving as a judicial law clerk was to work as a special assistant to then Attorney General Ben Civiletti. Ed Levi, and Griffin Bell the first Attorneys General appointed after Watergate had enunciated the norms that would ensure the departments’ adherence to the rule of law. Attorney General Civiletti undertook to continue their work of crafting those norms into written policies.\nMerrick Garland: (24:25)\nThose policies included; guaranteeing the independence of the department from partisan influence and law enforcement investigations, regulating communications with the White House, establishing guidelines for FBI investigations, ensuring respect for the professionalism of DOJ’s lawyers and agents, and setting our principles to guide the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. Those policies became part of the DNA of every career lawyer and agent.\nMerrick Garland: (25:03)\nIf confirmed, my mission as Attorney General will be to reaffirm those policies as the principles upon which the department operates. As Ed Levi said at his own swearing in, “Nothing can more weaken the quality of life, or more imperil the realization of the goals we all hold dear, than our failure to make clear by words and deed that our law is not the instrument of partisan purpose.”\nMerrick Garland: (25:35)\nIn the decades that followed my first tour of duty at the department, I returned again and again in different roles. As a career line Assistant U.S. Attorney, as a Criminal Division Supervisor, and finally as a Senior Official in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General. In the latter role, I worked with every component of the department. On issues ranging from Civil Rights and antitrust, to domestic terrorism and national security. I also worked directly with line prosecutors and agents in offices from Oklahoma City to Billings, Montana. From Sacramento, California, to New York City.\nMerrick Garland: (26:20)\nAttorney General, later Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson famously said, “The citizens safety lies in the prosecutor who tempers zeal with human kindness, who seeks truth and not victims, who serves the law and not factional purposes, and who approaches his job with humility.” That was the kind of prosector I tried to be during my years of service at DOJ.\nMerrick Garland: (26:51)\nIn 1997, I left the department to serve the cause of justice in another role, as a judge. I have loved being a judge. But to serve as Attorney General at this critical time, to lead the more than 113,000 dedicated men and women who work at the department to ensure the role of law, is a calling I am honored and eager to answer.\nMerrick Garland: (27:24)\nAs everyone who watched yesterdays events in Washington now understands, if they did not understand before, the rule of law is not just some lawyers turn of phrase. It is the very foundation of our democracy. The essence of the rule of law is that like cases are treated alike. That there not be one rule for Democrats, and another for Republicans, one rule for friends, another for foes, one rule for the powerful, another for the powerless, one-\nMerrick Garland: (28:03)\n… for the powerful, another for the powerless. One rule for the rich and another for the poor, or different rules, depending upon one’s race or ethnicity. And the essence of its great corollary, equal justice under law is that all citizens are protected in the exercise of their civil rights. Those ideals have animated the department of justice since the very moment of its inception. As President-elect Biden, just recounted the department was founded in the midst of reconstruction, following the Civil War, with its first principle task to ensure compliance with the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments.\nMerrick Garland: (28:53)\nAs historian Ron Chernow wrote, “The new Justice Department would forge its identity in the battle to slay the first incarnation of the KU Klux Klan and its offshoots.” In that battle, the department successfully deployed its considerable resources to ensure civil rights, which were under militant attack. These principles, ensuring the rule of law and making the promise of equal justice under law real are the great principles upon which the department of justice was founded and for which it must always stand.\nMerrick Garland: (29:35)\nThey echo today in the priorities that lie before us. From ensuring racial equity in our justice system to meeting the evolving threat of violent extremism. If confirmed, those are the principles to which I will be devoted as attorney general. President-elect Biden understands this as he said today. And as he has publicly said before, “It’s not my Justice Department, it’s the people’s Justice Department.” He promised that the person he chose to lead the department would have the, “Independent capacity to decide who gets prosecuted and who doesn’t.” Vice-president elect Harris has also publicly stated, “Any decision coming out of the Justice Department should be based on facts, should be based on the law. It should not be based on politics period.” I could not agree more. And I would not have agreed to be considered for attorney general under any other conditions. So thank you both for giving me the opportunity to serve.\nKamala Harris: (31:25)\nMr. President-elect, madam vice-president elect, thank you for this opportunity to return to the Department of Justice and to work alongside this incredible team on behalf of the American people. I also want to thank my family for their love and support, and especially my parents for their lessons, large and small, in what it means to live one’s values. It’s fair to say that I grew up in the Justice Department. It was my privilege for 15 years to serve that institution and to learn so much from its extraordinary people. To learn what it means to be a lawyer in public service. And over the years, I have worn many hats. As a career prosecutor, as a senior official in the FBI and as a leader of the National Security Division. But it was as an assistant US attorney that I learned the Justice Department’s values.\nKamala Harris: (32:38)\nI worked directly with communities and victims of crime, and I felt the weight of a prosecutor’s responsibility to ensure not that cases are won, but that justice is done, and that each individual defendant’s rights are protected. These experiences forged in me, a reverence for the Department of Justice as an institution for its people, for its mission, for the enduring values that it represents. The protection of civil rights and civil liberties, safeguarding the public from threats of all kinds and upholding the rule of law. Merrick’s mention of former Attorney General Edward Levy calls to mind. One of my earliest memories as a DOJ lawyer. My first job in the department was as counsel to Janet Reno, the first woman attorney general, a mentor to me and a trailblazer. In the conference room outside her office, she hung a portrait of Ed Levy, a tribute to his role in reaffirming the integrity and independence of the institution after Watergate.\nKamala Harris: (33:58)\nAnd I think she hung that portrait as a testament of sorts to the fact that we are all temporary custodians of the institution. The story goes that when President Ford asked Levy what he thought the department needed most in those days of flagging faith in institutions, Levy responded, “A soul.” Well, the soul of the Justice Department lives in the integrity of its career professionals, in the independence of its investigations and prosecutions and in the principles it brings to bear as it stewards the ideal of justice in America. Today, we are at another inflection point. Some of the challenges we face are familiar. Racial inequality, the need for criminal justice reform, domestic terrorism and threats to public safety. Some of the tasks are enduring, like the importance of working closely with law enforcement to ensure public safety and to build trust in our communities. Some of the challenges are evolving, like mounting cyber threats.\nKamala Harris: (35:21)\nI’m confident that the Department of Justice is up to all of these challenges. But what is most critical I think in the days ahead is not actually a challenge at all, but an opportunity. For this team and for the career professionals who make up the Justice Department to reaffirm its norms and traditions. To do justice without fear or favor, to keep the American people safe and to do so always consistent with the rule of law. If confirmed, it will be my honor to once again, work alongside the women and men of the Justice Department as custodians of a remarkable and durable institution. Mr. president-elect, madam vice-president elect, thank you for the opportunity to return home to the Department of Justice.\nSpeaker 2: (36:39)\nMr. president-elect, madam vice president, thank you for the opportunity to serve this nation. I want to thank my family and my parents who taught me early on the values that have led me to civil rights work in public service. I am humbled and honored to return to the Department of Justice. It is an institution that I love so, so dearly. And to once again work alongside the exceptional women and men, who every day defend the constitution, enforce our federal laws and seek to create a more perfect do union with deep integrity and without political interference. There are many agencies in the federal government, but actually only one that bears the name of a value. By virtue of that name, that value of justice, we know the department carries a unique charge and North Star. At its best. It is the keeper of a sacred promise.\nSpeaker 2: (37:45)\nIt’s the promise of equal justice for all. That no one is above the law. And when this promise is pursued with vigor, it brings light to our nation and serves as a beacon to the world. But when abandoned, we degrade our democracy, and sew the division that we’ve come to know all too well. The first time I felt the absence of that promise was as a four year old child, one of my earliest memories. My parents were proud immigrants from India, an opportunity that was made possible by the civil rights movement and the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act. One day I was sitting in a McDonald’s restaurant with my sister, mother, and grandmother. And as we ate our meals, a group of skinheads at the next table began shouting ethnic slurs at us, throwing food at us until we had to leave the restaurant. It is an early memory, but one that is seared in my mind. That feeling never left me of what it means to be made to feel unsafe because of who you are.\nSpeaker 2: (38:52)\nI kept another feeling with me though, too. And that is one that has been ingrained in me by my parents and shared by my husband, whose family fled violence and war in Vietnam and sought refuge on these shores. They believed more than anything in the promise of America, and that loving this country brings with it the obligation to do the necessary work to make it better. Those two feelings for me, converge in the work ahead of us. Yesterday’s horrific events at the Capitol reminded us that our democracy cannot be taken for granted, that our nation has a long history of disinformation, white supremacist violence, mob violence. It also reminded us that our values and our constitution and our democracy, these do not protect themselves, it is people with courage who do that. And I am honored to return to a department that I will push every day for justice, accountability and equality under the law. It will not be enough to restore what has been undermined or lost. This moment demands bold leadership. The Department of Justice, as it has done throughout its storied history will have to uncover and reckon with hard truths, hold people, companies, and institutions accountable to our constitution and laws, drive change where there is injustice and heal a nation that is starving for leadership and decency and hope. Now is the time to ensure that our economic system works for everyone, that we can protect the health and safety of all of the American people, and that we will harness all of the Justice Department’s levers for civil rights, justice and police reform and climate justice and so much more.\nSpeaker 2: (40:49)\nAs the late Congressman John Lewis said, “Democracy is not a state, it is an act.” And I pledge to the American people that if confirmed, I will act for justice every day. I pledge that to you, president-elect, I pledge that to you, vice-president elect. I am honored, deeply honored for the chance to work together with activists for justice, with law enforcement, with this extraordinary team that I’m so humbled to serve, with the incredible women and men at the Justice Department to strengthen our democracy and to make equal justice under law a real promise for all. Thank you so much for this opportunity.\nSpeaker 3: (41:54)\nMr. President-elect, madam vice-president elect, it’s an honor, and a privilege to be nominated to return to the Department-\nSpeaker 3: (42:03)\n… honor and a privilege to be nominated to return to the Department of Justice and serve the American people at this critical moment in our democracy. I am humbled and exceedingly proud to join the remarkable team that you have put together to pursue the urgent timeless cause of equal justice under law. I stand here today deeply inspired by the example of the late Thurgood Marshall, Constance Baker Motley, and other public servants who dedicated their lives to advancing the cause of justice. We are at a crossroads. If I’m fortunate enough to be confirmed, we will turn the page on hate and closed the door on discrimination by enforcing our federal civil rights laws.\nSpeaker 3: (42:59)\nGrowing up in Brooklyn, New York, my parents instilled in me an unrelenting belief in the principles of hard work and respect for the dignity and humanity of all people. I am deeply thankful full for the trail that my parents blazed. And today, I’m thinking about the pride that I know my mother Pansy, my brother Troy, my sister Karen, and my partner Mustafa are feeling as I take on this challenging new opportunity. As a mom myself now, I see the future of America through the eyes of my son, and honestly, at times I am worried. Will he have full and equal access to the extraordinary opportunities of American life? Will he be able to embrace those opportunities in safety and dignity? Will all of America’s children? Every parent lays awake some nights asking these same questions. I know that my own parents did. I was fortunate to benefit from amazing educational opportunities and plenty of lucky breaks that opened doors for me.\nSpeaker 3: (44:18)\nBut I knew then as I know today that not everyone is blessed with the opportunities that I enjoyed and that awareness has animated my life’s work. It’s what brought me to the Department of Justice where I started my career and it’s what brings me back for this homecoming today. The Department, and especially the Civil Rights Division has always occupied a special place in my heart. The clarion call of equal justice under law is what binds us together as a nation. Now, it’s my honor to return to work alongside the dedicated career professionals who give of themselves every day to make that principle real in the lives of families like mine, in my son’s life, and in the lives of all of our sons and daughters. I know the passion and fearlessness that both the President-Elect and the Vice President-Elect bring to the work before us to restore justice, to heal our nation, and to move us closer to that ideal of equal justice. I’m humbled, honored, and eager to work with them and with this team. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to serve my country as a member of your administration.\nKamala Harris: (46:13)\nOne of the fundamental principles upon which America’s democracy rests, a principle as sacred as a civic value can be is fidelity to the rule of law. In times of stability, that principle can seem abstract, like something out of a legal textbook that isn’t relevant to our daily lives. But in times of upheaval, we come to realize, to appreciate just how vital the rule of law truly is. What we saw yesterday in our nation’s Capitol was, as the President-Elect has called it, an assault on the rule of law and it has no place in our democracy. So I believe we must ask ourselves two questions about what happened yesterday, what went wrong, and how do we make it right? And I believe the answers require us to recognize that the challenge we’re facing in our country is about more than the actions of the few we watched yesterday.\nKamala Harris: (47:32)\nIt’s about how to reform, how to transform a justice system that does not work equally for all, a justice system that is experienced differently, depending on whether you’re White or Black, a justice system that is experienced differently if you’re rich or poor, a justice system that’s different depending on whether your job requires you to take a shower before you go to work or requires you to take a shower when you come home after work. We witnessed two systems of justice when we saw one that let extremists storm the United States Capitol, and another that released tear gas on peaceful protesters last summer. The American people have expressed rightly outrage. We know this is unacceptable. We know we should be better than this. The promise of our country is that all people will be treated equally. That’s what the rule of law is supposed to be about. That’s what the ideal of equal justice under law is all about.\nKamala Harris: (49:09)\nLike everyone here, I’ve dedicated my career to helping uphold those principles, to attempting to uphold those principles, to helping build a more just and equal America, whether it was as San Francisco’s District Attorney or California’s Attorney General or a United States Senator. And that’s what I have pledged to the President- Elect that I will do as Vice President. The public servants we are announcing today have also dedicated themselves to building a more just and equal America and the roles they will assume are some of the most important in our country, and especially right now. They will be responsible for pursuing justice and ensuring that all Americans are treated equally. They will be the guardians of our justice system. They will have the power to enforce our laws in a more fair and more humane manner, while also holding those who violate the law accountable, whether they be ordinary citizens or law enforcement.\nKamala Harris: (50:21)\nThey will help protect the rights of every voter in our country no matter what their background or where they live and they will restore integrity and independence to the Department of Justice and rebuild the American people’s trust in that most sacred institution. And I know they will do this because these nominees have the experience, the judgment, and moral compass that these roles demand, as well as an abiding commitment to supporting and defending the constitution of the United States of America. For many centuries, the ideal of justice has been symbolized as a woman blindfolded with a scale in her hands. There is a reason the eyes of that lady justice are covered. It’s because our belief in what a system of justice is says that it should not depend, justice should not depend on how you look, on the color of your skin, on how much money you make.\nKamala Harris: (51:36)\nIt shouldn’t depend on where you were born or the language your grandmother speaks or what political party you belong to. Justice should be impartial. It should be fair. It should be applied equally. And President-Elect Biden and I, along with this incredible team, will help to make sure it is while restoring and strengthening the rule of law that has always been and always will be the bedrock of America’s democracy. Thank you, Mr. President-Elect.\nSpeaker 4: (52:16)\nShould Trump be prosecuted for inciting a riot?\nSpeaker 5: (52:19)\nHave you spoken to Mike Pence?\nSpeaker 6: (52:19)\nHe should be removed.\nSpeaker 7: (52:19)\nTechnical pool, travel pool, we need to load.

All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state.”\nHe later added: “So what are we going to do here, folks? I only need 11,000 votes. Fellas, I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break.”\nThe rambling and at times incoherent conversation offered a remarkable glimpse of how consumed and desperate the president remains about his loss, unwilling or unable to let the matter go and still asserting he can reverse the results in enough battleground states to remain in office.\n“There’s no way I lost Georgia,” Trump said, a phrase he repeated again and again on the call. “There’s no way. We won by hundreds of thousands of votes.”\nSeveral of his allies were on the line as he spoke, including White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and conservative lawyer Cleta Mitchell, a prominent GOP attorney whose involvement with Trump’s efforts had not been previously known.\nIn a statement, Mitchell said Raffensperger’s office “has made many statements over the past two months that are simply not correct and everyone involved with the efforts on behalf of the President’s election challenge has said the same thing: show us your records on which you rely to make these statements that our numbers are wrong.”\nThe White House, the Trump campaign and Meadows did not respond to a request for comment.\nRaffensperger’s office declined to comment.\nOn Sunday, Trump tweeted that he had spoken to Raffensperger, saying the secretary of state was “unwilling, or unable, to answer questions such as the ‘ballots under table’ scam, ballot destruction, out of state ‘voters’, dead voters, and more. He has no clue!”\nRaffensperger responded with his own tweet: “Respectfully, President Trump: What you’re saying is not true.”\nThe details of the call drew demands from top Democrats for criminal investigations. Campaigning in Georgia, Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris called Trump’s conversation a “baldfaced, bold abuse of power by the president of the United States.” Biden’s top campaign lawyer, Bob Bauer, said the recording “captures the whole, disgraceful story about Donald Trump’s assault on American democracy.”\nRepublicans, however, were largely silent. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), when asked about the call while campaigning in Georgia on Sunday for the two GOP senators who face a runoff Tuesday, dodged the question completely.\nTrump’s pressure campaign on Raffensperger is the latest example of his attempt to subvert the outcome of the Nov. 3 election through personal outreach to state Republican officials. He previously invited Michigan Republican state leaders to the White House, pressured Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) in a call to try to replace that state’s electors and asked the speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives to help reverse his loss in that state.\nHis call to Raffensperger came as scores of Republicans have pledged to challenge the electoral college’s vote for Biden when Congress convenes for a joint session on Wednesday. Republicans do not have the votes to successfully thwart Biden’s victory, but Trump has urged supporters to travel to Washington to protest the outcome, and state and federal officials are already bracing for clashes outside the Capitol.\nDuring their conversation, Trump issued a vague threat to both Raffensperger and Ryan Germany, the secretary of state’s general counsel, suggesting that if they don’t find that thousands of ballots in Fulton County have been illegally destroyed to block investigators — an allegation for which there is no evidence — they would be subject to criminal liability.\n“That’s a criminal offense,” he said. “And you can’t let that happen. That’s a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer.”\nTrump also told Raffensperger that failure to act by Tuesday would jeopardize the political fortunes of David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, Georgia’s two Republican senators whose fate in that day’s runoff elections will determine control of the U.S. Senate.\nTrump said he plans to talk about the alleged fraud Monday, when he is scheduled to lead an election eve rally in Dalton, Ga. — a message that could further muddle the efforts of Republicans to draw their voters out.\n“You have a big election coming up, and because of what you’ve done to the president — you know, the people of Georgia know that this was a scam,” Trump said. “Because of what you’ve done to the president, a lot of people aren’t going out to vote, and a lot of Republicans are going to vote negative because they hate what you did to the president. Okay? They hate it. And they’re going to vote. And you would be respected, really respected, if this can be straightened out before the election.”\nTrump’s conversation with Raffensperger echoed his effort to persuade the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden on a call that led to his impeachment, and once again put him in legally questionable territory, legal scholars said. By exhorting the secretary of state to “find” votes and to deploy investigators who “want to find answers,” the president appeared to be encouraging him to doctor the election outcome in Georgia, which could violate both state and federal law.\nAdditionally, Trump’s apparent threat of criminal consequences if Raffensperger failed to act could be seen as an attempt at extortion and a suggestion that he might deploy the Justice Department to launch an investigation, they said.\n“The president is either knowingly attempting to coerce state officials into corrupting the integrity of the election or is so deluded that he believes what he’s saying,” said Richard H. Pildes, a constitutional law professor at New York University, who noted that Trump’s actions may have violated several federal statutes.\nBut Pildes said Trump’s clearer transgression is a moral one, and he emphasized that focusing on whether he committed a crime could deflect attention from the “simple, stark, horrific fact that we have a president trying to use the powers of his office to pressure state officials into committing election fraud to keep him in office.”\nProsecutors would likely exercise discretion in considering a case against an outgoing president, experts said. Edward B. Foley, a law professor at Ohio State University, said the legal questions are murky, and it could be difficult to prove that Trump knew he was encouraging illegal behavior. But Foley also emphasized that the call was “inappropriate and contemptible” and should prompt outrage.\n“He was already tripping the emergency meter,” Foley said. “So we were at 12 on a scale of 1 to 10, and now we’re at 15.”\nThroughout the call, Trump detailed an exhaustive list of disinformation and conspiracy theories to support his position. He claimed without evidence that he had won Georgia by at least a half-million votes. He floated a barrage of assertions that have been investigated and disproved: that thousands of dead people voted; that an Atlanta election worker scanned 18,000 forged ballots three times each and “100 percent” were for Biden; that thousands more voters living out of state came back to Georgia illegally just to vote in the election.\n“So tell me, Brad, what are we going to do? We won the election, and it’s not fair to take it away from us like this,” Trump said. “And it’s going to be very costly in many ways. And I think you have to say that you’re going to reexamine it, and you can reexamine it, but reexamine it with people that want to find answers, not people who don’t want to find answers.”\nTrump did most of the talking. He was angry and impatient, calling Raffensperger a “child,” and said law enforcement officials were “either dishonest or incompetent” for not finding widespread ballot fraud in Atlanta. He twice called himself a “schmuck” for endorsing Kemp, whom Trump holds in particular contempt for not embracing his claims.\n“I can’t imagine he’s ever getting elected again, I’ll tell you that much right now,” he said of the governor.\nHe also took aim at Kemp’s 2018 opponent, Democrat Stacey Abrams, trying to shame Raffensperger with the idea that his refusal to embrace fraud has helped her and Democrats generally. “Stacey Abrams is laughing about you,” he said. “She’s going around saying, ‘These guys are dumber than a rock.’ What she’s done to this party is unbelievable, I tell you.”\nThe secretary of state repeatedly sought to correct Trump, saying at one point, “Mr. President, the problem you have with social media, they — people can say anything.”\n“Oh this isn’t social media,” Trump retorted. “This is Trump media. It’s not social media. It’s really not. It’s not social media. I don’t care about social media. I couldn’t care less.”\nAt another point, Trump claimed that votes were scanned three times: “Brad, why did they put the votes in three times? You know, they put ’em in three times.”\nRaffensperger responded: “Mr. President, they did not. We did an audit of that, and we proved conclusively that they were not scanned three times.”\nTrump sounded at turns confused and meandering. At one point, he referred to Kemp as “George.” He tossed out several different figures for Biden’s margin of victory in Georgia and referred to the Senate runoff, which is Tuesday, as happening “tomorrow” and “Monday.”\nHis desperation was perhaps most pronounced during an exchange with Germany, Raffensperger’s general counsel, in which he openly begged for validation.\nTrump: “Do you think it’s possible that they shredded ballots in Fulton County? Because that’s what the rumor is. And also that Dominion took out machines. That Dominion is really moving fast to get rid of their, uh, machinery. Do you know anything about that? Because that’s illegal, right?”\nGermany responded: “No, Dominion has not moved any machinery out of Fulton County.”\nTrump: “But have they moved the inner parts of the machines and replaced them with other parts?”\nGermany: “No.”\nTrump: “Are you sure, Ryan?”\nGermany: “I’m sure. I’m sure, Mr. President.”\nDespite Trump’s intense hunt for voter fraud, officials in key states have so far identified just a small number of possible cases\nIt was clear from the call that Trump has surrounded himself with aides who have fed his false perceptions that the election was stolen. When he claimed that more than 5,000 ballots were cast in Georgia in the name of dead people, Raffensperger responded forcefully: “The actual number was two. Two. Two people that were dead that voted.”\nBut later, Meadows said, “I can promise you there are more than that.”\nAnother Trump lawyer on the call, Kurt Hilbert, accused Raffensperger’s office of refusing to turn over data to assess evidence of fraud, and he claimed awareness of at least 24,000 illegally cast ballots that would flip the result to Trump.\n“It stands to reason that if the information is not forthcoming, there’s something to hide,” Hilbert said. “That’s the problem that we have.”\nReached by phone Sunday, Hilbert declined to comment.\nFor her part, Mitchell contradicted Trump on several occasions on the call, saying, “Well, I don’t know about that,” when the president alleged that a Fulton County election worker had triple-counted 18,000 ballots for Biden. She claimed that the extent of the fraud is unclear because Raffensperger’s office has not shared all the data Trump’s lawyers have sought.\n“We never had the records that you have,” she said. Germany noted that the office is barred under law from sharing certain voter information.\nIn the end, Trump asked Germany to sit down with one of his attorneys to go over the allegations. Germany agreed.\nYet Trump also recognized that he was failing to persuade Raffensperger or Germany of anything, saying toward the end, “I know this phone call is going nowhere.”\n“Why don’t you want to find this, Ryan?” he asked of Germany. “What’s wrong with you? I heard your lawyer is very difficult, actually, but I’m sure you’re a good lawyer. You have a nice last name.”\nBut he continued to make his case in repetitive fashion, until finally, after roughly an hour, Raffensperger put an end to the conversation: “Thank you, President Trump, for your time.”\nAlice Crites contributed to this report.\nComplete coverage: The Trump-Raffensperger call\nStory: In extraordinary hour-long call, Trump pressures Georgia secretary of state to recalculate the vote in his favor\nHere’s the full transcript and audio of the call between Trump and Raffensperger\nFact-checking Trump’s call to the Georgia secretary of state\nUpdate: Lawyer Cleta Mitchell, who advised Trump on Saturday phone call, resigns from law firm\nReaction: The Trump-Raffensperger call was big news — unless you were following conservative media\nElection results under attack: Here are the facts"}, {"claim": "The US Congress has one job on January 6th 2021: to count electoral votes that have been cast by any state.", "required_reannotation": true, "label": "Supported", "justification": "The congresses job following an election is to count electoral votes.

Mike Gallagher (R-WI), Kelly Armstrong (R-ND), Ken Buck (R-CO), Thomas Massie (R-KY), Tom McClintock (R-CA), Chip Roy (R-TX), and Nancy Mace (R-SC) released the following statement concerning concerning the January 6 vote to certify electoral votes.\n\"We, like most Americans, are outraged at the significant abuses in our election system resulting from the reckless adoption of mail-in ballots and the lack of safeguards maintained to guarantee that only legitimate votes are cast and counted. It is shameful that between both chambers of the U.S. Congress, we have held precisely one hearing on election integrity since Election Day.\n\"The people cannot trust a system that refuses to guarantee that only legal votes are cast to select its leaders. The elections held in at least six battleground states raise profound questions, and it is a legal, constitutional, and moral imperative that they be answered.\n\"But only the states have authority to appoint electors, in accordance with state law. Congress has only a narrow role in the presidential election process. Its job is to count the electors submitted by the states, not to determine which electors the states should have sent.\n\"The text of the United States Constitution, and the Twelfth Amendment in particular, is clear. With respect to presidential elections, there is no authority for Congress to make value judgments in the abstract regarding any state's election laws or the manner in which they have been implemented. Nor does Congress have discretion to disqualify electors based on its own finding that fraud occurred in that state's election. Congress has one job here: to count electoral votes that have in fact been cast by any state, as designated by those authorized to do so under state law.\n\"As of this moment, not a single state has submitted multiple conflicting slates of electoral votes. In other words, every state has sent either (a) Biden electors, or (b) Trump electors. Of the six states as to which questions have been raised, five have legislatures that are controlled by Republicans, and they all have the power to send a new slate of electoral votes to Congress if they deem such action appropriate under state law. Unless that happens between now and January 6, 2021, Congress will have no authority to influence the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.\n\"To take action otherwise – that is, to unconstitutionally insert Congress into the center of the presidential election process – would amount to stealing power from the people and the states. It would, in effect, replace the electoral college with Congress, and in so doing strengthen the efforts of those on the left who are determined to eliminate it or render it irrelevant.\n\"From a purely partisan perspective, Republican presidential candidates have won the national popular vote only once in the last 32 years. They have therefore depended on the electoral college for nearly all presidential victories in the last generation. If we perpetuate the notion that Congress may disregard certified electoral votes—based solely on its own assessment that one or more states mishandled the presidential election—we will be delegitimizing the very system that led Donald Trump to victory in 2016, and that could provide the only path to victory in 2024.\n\"There is one and only one path to victory for President Trump on January 6, 2021, and it depends on state legislatures certifying Trump electors in the states at issue, pursuant to state law and the U.S. Constitution, and based on a finding that votes lawfully cast in November were sufficient to produce a Trump victory. If they believe there was fraud—and if they believe that such fraud affected the outcome of the election—they must, as a body, convene immediately and send us that information, along with certified electoral votes cast by a Trump slate of electors. Absent such action, there is not a constitutional role for Congress to change the outcome of any state's vote.\n\"The text of the Constitution is clear. States select electors. Congress does not. Accordingly, our path forward is also clear. We must respect the states' authority here. Though doing so may frustrate our immediate political objectives, we have sworn an oath to promote the Constitution above our policy goals. We must count the electoral votes submitted by the states.\"\nIssues:Congress"}, {"claim": "Lord Subrahmanyeswara Swamy's idol has been vandalized in Vigneswara Temple at Rajahmundry", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Supported", "justification": "Lord Subrahmanyeswara Swamy's idol has been vandalized in Vigneswara Temple at Rajahmundry", "claim_date": "1-1-2021", "speaker": "@missionkaali", "original_claim_url": "https://twitter.com/missionkaali/status/1345044865428705281", "fact_checking_article": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210121235651/https://newsmeter.in/fact-check/lord-subrahmanyeswara-swamys-idol-has-been-vandalized-in-vigneswara-temple-at-rajahmundry-672435", "reporting_source": "twitter", "location_ISO_code": "IN", "claim_types": ["Event/Property Claim"], "fact_checking_strategies": ["Written Evidence"], "questions": [{"question": "Which temple was desecrated on the intervening night of 31st December and 1st January", "answers": [{"answer": "Lord Vigneshwara temple of Rajahmundry district", "answer_type": "Extractive", "source_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210117222158/https://www.republicworld.com/india-news/general-news/after-lord-rama-another-deitys-idol-desecrated-in-andhra-pradesh-2nd-incident-in-a-week.html", "source_medium": "Web text"}]}, {"question": "In the temple that was desecrated which idol was tampered with", "answers": [{"answer": "Lord Subrahmanya Swamy's idol", "answer_type": "Extractive", "source_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210117222158/https://www.republicworld.com/india-news/general-news/after-lord-rama-another-deitys-idol-desecrated-in-andhra-pradesh-2nd-incident-in-a-week.html", "source_medium": "Web text"}]}, {"question": "How was Lord Subrahmanyeswara Swamy's idol desecrated", "answers": [{"answer": "On Friday morning, priests of Vigneshwara temple in Sriramnagar in Rajahmundry found the two arms of Lord Subrahmanya's rock figurine severed", "answer_type": "Extractive", "source_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210102062923/https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/yet-another-hindu-temple-idol-desecrated-in-andhra-pradesh-934108.html", "source_medium": "Web text"}]}], "orig_claim": "Lord Subrahmanyeswara Swamy’s idol has been vandalized in Vigneswara Temple at Rajahmundry", "orig_verdict": "True", "fulltext": "Another Mandir vandalized in Rajamandhry, Andhra Pradesh.

You have tweeted that, as long as Republicans have “courage,” they can overturn the results and give you four more years in office.\nIn other words, you’re cheering for an undemocratic coup.\nYou had every right to investigate the election. But let’s be clear: Those efforts have found nothing. To take just two examples: Your campaign paid $3 million for a recount in two Wisconsin counties, and you lost by 87 more votes. Georgia did two recounts of the state, each time affirming Biden’s win. These ballots were counted by hand, which alone debunks the claims of a Venezuelan vote-manipulating Kraken conspiracy.\nSidney Powell is a crazy person. Michael Flynn suggesting martial law is tantamount to treason. It is shameful.\nWe understand, Mr. President, that you’re angry that you lost. But to continue down this road is ruinous. We offer this as a newspaper that endorsed you, that supported you: If you want to cement your influence, even set the stage for a future return, you must channel your fury into something more productive.\nStop thinking about Jan. 6. Start thinking about Jan. 5.\nIf Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler win, they will prevent Biden from rolling back what you have accomplished. A Republican Senate can pressure Biden against returning to the old, failed Iran deal, can stop him from throwing open our southern border, will prevent him from packing the Supreme Court.\nNow imagine a government controlled by your nemeses — Nancy Pelosi in the House, Chuck Schumer in the Senate, Biden in the White House. How high will taxes go? How many of your initiatives will be strangled? And, on a personal note, do you think they won’t spend the next four years torturing you with baseless hearings and investigations?\nConsider this. You came out of nowhere to win the presidency. Not an elected official, not a lawyer, not beholden to any particular faction of the swamp. You took on the elites and the media who had long lost touch with average working people. You changed politics, which is something few in American history can say.\nIf Georgia falls, all that is threatened. You will leave your party out of power, less likely to listen to what you have to say or to capitalize on your successes, such as expanding the Hispanic voting bloc for the GOP.\nDemocrats will try to write you off as a one-term aberration and, frankly, you’re helping them do it. The King Lear of Mar-a-Lago, ranting about the corruption of the world.\nSecuring the Senate means securing your legacy. You should use your considerable charm and influence to support the Georgia candidates, mobilizing your voters for them. Focus on their success, not your own grievances, as we head into the final week.\nIf you insist on spending your final days in office threatening to burn it all down, that will be how you are remembered.

Por ser uma região distante e de difícil acesso, que poucas pessoas de fato conheciam, muitas acabaram aceitando essas verdades criadas por especialistas de suas vontades, plantadas como “boas sementes” e cuidadosamente regadas até criarem raízes.\nNo lugar de árvores, as verdades plantadas germinaram ervas daninhas, que, como é da natureza da espécie, se alastraram rapidamente, trazendo danos incalculáveis, que impediram o desenvolvimento sustentável da Amazônia e de seu povo, enclausurando-os em estufas isoladas do resto do Brasil, com infraestrutura e serviços públicos insuficientes e acesso mínimo a avanços econômicos, tecnológicos e científicos, como os providos à Região Centro-Sul, agregando à distância geográfica o distanciamento econômico e social entre essas regiões. Pouco pela Amazônia...\nReconhecendo a necessidade de coordenação de esforços e maior presença do Estado em prol de preservação, proteção e desenvolvimento sustentável da Amazônia, o presidente Bolsonaro recriou, em 11/2/2020, o Conselho Nacional da Amazônia Legal (Cnal), delegando-me a tarefa de conduzi-lo. A gestão efetiva da porção brasileira da Amazônia constitui enorme desafio, só comparável à dimensão da maior floresta tropical do planeta, que ocupa cerca de 60% do território nacional. Desde então, trabalhamos incessantemente, buscando integração e prioridade dos diversos projetos, ações e políticas relacionados àquela área.\nTambém nos dedicamos a ouvir, unir esforços e estabelecer diálogo com líderes políticos, estaduais, empresariais, sociais, estrangeiros, formadores de opinião, instituições científicas, academias e comunidades locais, em prol da melhoria dos índices de sustentabilidade e desenvolvimento humano, enxergando a Amazônia como um todo – fauna, flora, riquezas minerais, hídricas e pessoas, num quadro de desafios, mas também de muitas oportunidades.\nConduzi três reuniões com os ministérios que compõem o Cnal. Articulei com Estados e municípios a cooperação e gestão integrada e compartilhada de políticas públicas entre as três esferas de governo. Com exceção do Tocantins, visitei todos os Estados da Amazônia Legal para conhecer suas realidades, ouvir as preocupações e demandas de governadores e sociedade e alinhar ações. Apresentei a embaixadores estrangeiros os verdadeiros índices brasileiros de preservação ambiental (84% da vegetação nativa na Amazônia e 66% em todo o território nacional) e os levei para verificar in loco a complexidade, os desafios, oportunidades e projetos da região. Articulei parcerias público-privadas. Ouvi os anseios de grupos representativos da sociedade civil e comunidades locais, considerando suas percepções e necessidades no desenvolvimento dos trabalhos e planejamento de ações futuras. Contribuímos para o Comitê Interministerial sobre Mudança do Clima. Criamos a Comissão Brasileira da Organização do Tratado de Cooperação Amazônica, permanente do Cnal. Buscamos a retomada do Fundo Amazônia e novas fontes de financiamento, entre outras iniciativas.\nEstruturamos diversos instrumentos norteadores para a região e os trabalhos do conselho, como Mapa Estratégico e Plano de Comunicação do Cnal, Iniciativas Estratégicas Prioritárias, Plano de Ações Imediatas e, em finalização, o Plano de Coordenação e Integração de Políticas Públicas e o Plano Estratégico 2020-2030, documento orientador para as ações dos ministérios que integram o Cnal, representando um pacto a favor da Amazônia e compromisso com o fortalecimento das ações governamentais na região.\nCom atuação no campo da Operação Verde Brasil 2, com as Forças Armadas em apoio aos órgãos de segurança e fiscalização estaduais e federais, avançamos no combate a crimes ambientais e outros ilícitos, obtendo resultados expressivos, como na apreensão de madeira ilegal (187,147 m3), embarcações (1.518), minerais (154.050.045 kg), drogas (392 kg), tratores (261); e nos índices de desmatamento, que estão em queda desde junho, na faixa de 20% a 30%, com exceção de outubro, que teve um pico, mas voltando a cair 44% em novembro em relação ao mesmo período de 2019.\nEm 2021 continuaremos atuantes, aperfeiçoando nossos esforços em benefício da Amazônia e das gerações presentes e futuras, tendo como prioridades o monitoramento e o combate a crimes ambientais e fundiários, fortalecimento das agências ambientais, incremento de fontes de financiamento, regularização fundiária e ordenamento territorial e estímulo à inovação e à bioeconomia.\nA sociedade brasileira confiou no governo Bolsonaro e nós daremos a resposta que ela espera: tudo pela Amazônia, enxergando a Amazônia como um todo!\nVICE-PRESIDENTE DA REPÚBLICA"}, {"claim": "The UK was able to approve the use of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine more quickly because of Brexit.", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Refuted", "justification": "Q&As establish the timestamps before presenting a source that refutes the claim.", "claim_date": "20-12-2020", "speaker": "UK health secretary Matt Hancock ", "original_claim_url": "https://twitter.com/TimesRadio/status/1334067497700560897?s=20", "fact_checking_article": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210513222242/https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-vaccine-brexit/", "reporting_source": "Twitter - interview on Times Radio", "location_ISO_code": "GB", "claim_types": ["Causal Claim", "Event/Property Claim"], "fact_checking_strategies": ["Written Evidence", "Fact-checker Reference"], "questions": [{"question": "On what date did the UK approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine?", "answers": [{"answer": "2 December 2020.", "answer_type": "Extractive", "source_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210515171618/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-medicines-regulator-gives-approval-for-first-uk-covid-19-vaccine", "source_medium": "Web text"}]}, {"question": "On what date did the EU approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine?", "answers": [{"answer": "At time of writing its not approved, The EUs medicine agency the EMA is said to have plans to conclude its decision whether to approve the vaccine during an extraordinary meeting scheduled for 29 December 2020 at the latest.", "answer_type": "Abstractive", "source_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210512003125/https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ema-receives-application-conditional-marketing-authorisation-covid-19-mrna-vaccine-bnt162b2", "source_medium": "Web text"}]}, {"question": "Why has the EU not yet approved the Pfizer Vaccine?", "answers": [{"answer": "The EU have chosen to adopt a common strategy between member states and will work together with their approach to dealing with the pandemic.", "answer_type": "Abstractive", "source_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210513135442/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/coronavirus/", "source_medium": "Web text"}, {"answer": "The medical agency for the EU the EMA wanted to look at the data from the trials for longer before approving the vaccine.", "answer_type": "Abstractive", "source_url": "https://time.com/5917109/u-k-covid-vaccine-approved/", "source_medium": "Web text"}]}, {"question": "If the UK was in the EU would it have had to follow the \"common strategy\" that other EU nations are in terms of approving the Pfizer vaccine?", "answers": [{"answer": "No", "answer_type": "Boolean", "source_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210404153725/https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/covid-vaccine-decisions-brexit", "source_medium": "Web text", "boolean_explanation": "Theres no obligation for countries within the EU to follow the \"common strategy\" so the UK could have still approved the vaccine earlier even if still members of the EU."}]}], "orig_claim": "The UK was able to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine more quickly because of Brexit.", "orig_verdict": "This is not correct.

Chauvin had been jailed in segregation at the maximum security Oak Park Heights, Minnesota prison awaiting a March 8 trial in the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. A Minnesota Department of Corrections spokesperson confirmed Chauvin was no longer being held at the prison on Wednesday, and state court records show he posted a non-cash $1 million bond on Oct. 7, signed by A-Affordable Bail Bonds of Brainerd, Minnesota. A notice of release was posted at 10:34 a.m. on Oct. 7.

Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell previously told FOX 9 such transfers of high-profile subjects from a county jail to state prison are \"not uncommon.” Oak Park Heights is the same prison where former Minneapolis officer Mohamed Noor was moved after being arrested for murder in the death of Justine Ruszczyk. Sources confirm he was processed out of Hennepin County Jail once the bail was accepted.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz has activated the National Guard to assist local law enforcement in the Twin Cities following Chauvin's release. The governor said that move was made \"out of an abundance of caution.\"\n\nChauvin was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter just four days after the Memorial Day death of George Floyd at the intersection of E. 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis.The charge was later upgraded to second-degree murder at the same time Attorney General Keith Ellison announced charges against the other three officers involved in Floyd's death.\n\nChauvin, the officer seen kneeling on Floyd's neck in a bystander video, is charged with se", "answer_type": "Extractive", "source_url": "https://www.fox9.com/news/derek-chauvin-released-from-jail-on-1-million-bond", "source_medium": "Web text"}]}], "orig_claim": "former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was killed in prison", "orig_verdict": "False", "fulltext": "Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer who murdered George Floyd, has been found dead in the jail where he’s been held since May 2020. He was apparently killed by fellow inmates.\nEven more shocking than his death at the hands of fellow prisoners is the fact that his will leaves half of his estate to the reelection campaign for impeached President Donald J. Trump. He was so excited about Trump’s win that he updated his will right after Trump’s election in 2016 to include that bequest.\nWhat’s *not* unexpected? That estate amounts to $34 and a George Foremangrill leftover from Chauvin’s days as a vain gym rat who tried to eat well — if by “eat well” you mean that donuts were limited to breakfast, lunch, and afternoon pre-nap snack. It remains to be seen how much the grill will fetch on the resale market for worn-out countertop appliances owned by disgusting, murderous racist pieces of sh*t.\nThe Trump campaign has already graciously accepted its $17 portion of the racist turd’s “estate.” Chauvin’s widow said she really could have used the money, but Trump is a greedy bastard and he also knows that being associated with a racist killer will be a positive for his campaign.\nPrison warden Sandy Batt announced the racist, murderous cop’s death with the following statement:\n“I won’t say this murderer’s name. He’s dead, and even though many of my guards had heard rumors that he was going to be offed, we all agreed that if anyone had it coming, this guy had it coming. Good riddance to racist trash.”\nThe state’s Commissioner of Prisons and Incarceration Dungeons, Joe Barron, commented: “It’s a damn shame this poor, persecuted law enforcement officer was killed by his fellow inmates. Their decision to kneel on his neck for 8 1/2 minutes was quite unfortunate. It’s almost like kneeling on someone’s neck — regardless of the reason — is always a bad thing to do.”\nWell, almost always.\nLeave a Reply"}, {"claim": "In support of the farmers’ movement, 25 thousand jawans returned their Shaurya Chakra awards.", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Refuted", "justification": "The source of the answer provides good information but the answer itself is vague.

Governor Evers or his staff must be involved in the task force in order to get the Governor’s support the legislation.\nWe do not have to travel down that well-worn road where the Legislature passes bills without any input from the minority party or the Governor and it then gets vetoed. It is worthless to keep trying the same thing over and over and expect a different outcome.\nAfter the past few elections, several issues have been raised about what needs to be discussed regarding our election laws. The record breaking number of people voting by absentee ballot will continue to rise given it is a popular option for many voters. Absentee balloting gives people the flexibility to choose how and when they want to vote. Increased voter participation in our elections is a good thing and we ought to promote it whenever we can.\nI would like to lessen the burden on our election workers and clerks by examining how we might allow for immediate tabulation of early in-person votes and absentee ballots. As you both know, many states have procedures in place to deal with this topic. As we have witnessed, Wisconsin’s laws are not equipped to deal with the situation we experienced and it has led to a pronounced number of conspiracy theories that have no merit. If we can address this problem, it would do a great deal of good.\nSimply allowing absentee ballots to be tabulated by at least the Monday before Election Day would give our overworked poll workers more time to efficiently process absentee ballots. Wisconsin is one of the few states that doesn’t allow absentee ballots to be processed before Election Day. Allowing this simple change would stop the false accusation that tens of thousands of ballots are secretly being dumped after midnight changing the outcome of the election. We all know our current process and know that is not\ntrue. It is just a matter our laws requiring workers to wait until 7:00 AM on Election Day to begin tabulating.\nMore and more people have demonstrated they want to vote by absentee ballot. Clarifying the requirements on how to properly fill out an absentee ballot needs to be another issue that is addressed so thousands of voter’s ballots are not invalidated because of a simple mistake. All citizens have a right to vote and that should be honored, not questioned and then disenfranchised.\nPeople voting by absentee ballot in elections during the COVID-19 pandemic were essentially forced to have to make a choice between staying safe at home or exercising their right to vote. Addressing issues related to holding elections during extraordinary circumstances such as we are experiencing due to the COVID-19 pandemic should also be discussed.\nMany people are looking for the State Legislature to work in a bipartisan manner to pass legislation to improve how our elections are run. I firmly believe creating a bipartisan task force on elections would help prevent the partisan gridlock the Legislature continues to demonstrate on so many issues. Instead, we could work to see how the election processes in Wisconsin can be improved in order to avoid the issues which have now consumed so many people’s opinion of the election’s results. Those opinions were only formed after this election. There was no problem with our processes when President Trump won here in 2016. It is only because of dubious accusations now that our processes are questioned.\nAfter all the drama has subsided, we have work to do to protect the voting interests of our constituents. What do we do if there is another pandemic?\nHow do we deal with voters in nursing homes that have demonstrated signs of dementia: who helps them vote? Does the careworker? Does the son or daughter or spouse? Who determines whether or not that voter’s intent was influenced by either caregivers or family?\nWhat do we do if this current pandemic persists into the next election cycle?\nCan we make it less of a hardship on our clerks and elections workers by altering our laws regarding the tabulation of early and absentee votes?\nCan we restore trust in our elections so we do not have another situation such as this?\nThese are issues we really need to address and it is my hope we can form a Bipartisan Blue Ribbon Task Force to begin addressing these topics. Again, the committee should be bipartisan with an equal number of Republicans and Democrats.\nWe owe it to Wisconsin voters to do the best we can to ensure that elections in our state are legitimate, fool-proof and verified. We also owe it to our election officials and clerks to have a system in place upon which there is total agreement. I look forward to hearing from either of you on your thoughts and ideas.\nSincerely,\nTIM CARPENTER\nState Senator\n3rd Senate District"}, {"claim": "On 9th December 2020, 50,000 Chinese soldiers were bombed and killed in Maine and the event listed as an earthquake.", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Refuted", "justification": "No evidence to support.", "claim_date": "10-12-2020", "speaker": null, "original_claim_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201216224743/https://darkoutpost.com/news/50000-chinese-soldiers-were-bombed-and-killed-in-maine-which-was-listed-as-an-earthquake/", "fact_checking_article": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201222041743/https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2020/12/fact-check-50000-chinese-soldiers-were-not-bombed-and-killed-in-maine.html", "reporting_source": "Dark Outpost", "location_ISO_code": "US", "claim_types": ["Event/Property Claim"], "fact_checking_strategies": ["Written Evidence", "Consultation"], "questions": [{"question": "Was there an earthquake in Maine on December 9, 2020?", "answers": [{"answer": "Yes", "answer_type": "Boolean", "source_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201221205449/https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/12/09/metro/small-earthquake-detected-maine-near-canadian-border/", "source_medium": "Web text", "boolean_explanation": "A minor earthquake was detected in Maine on December 9th, 2020."}]}, {"question": "Were 50,000 Chinese soldiers killed in Maine on December 9, 2020?", "answers": [{"answer": "No", "answer_type": "Boolean", "source_url": "Metadata", "source_medium": "Metadata", "boolean_explanation": "There is nothing to substantiate that 50,000 Chinese soldiers landed in Maine."}]}, {"question": "Was a bomb dropped on Maine on December 9, 2020?", "answers": [{"answer": "\"There is no evidence of a bomb being dropped,\" Ken Clark, chief of Calais Fire and Emerging Medical Services in Maine", "answer_type": "Extractive", "source_url": "Metadata", "source_medium": "Metadata"}]}], "orig_claim": "50,000 Chinese Soldiers Were Bombed And Killed In Maine Which Was Listed As An Earthquake", "orig_verdict": "Not A Bomb", "fulltext": "Hal Turner Radio Show has just Reported, “50,000 Chinese Soldiers were Bombed and Killed in Maine which was listed as an Earthquake.” Then an F16 was taken down in Michigan. 3 Aircraft Carrier Battle Groups Deployed on the West Coast and 2 Aircraft Carrier Battle Groups Deployed on the East Coast “POSITION TO SHOOT DOWN INCOMING NUCLEAR MISSILES.” The Chinese and Russian Navy are now Positioned for a Quick Move to Position “FROM WHICH THEY COULD QUICKLY ATTACK THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!”\n“THE GOVERNMENT CUT HAL’S SHOW ON COMPUTERS AND TELEPHONE RADIO LISTEN BECAUSE THE INFORMATION IS TOO DANGEROUS!” Only the Back Up Channel Works at this moment…\n“THE FIRST SHOTS OF WORLD WAR 3 HAVE BEEN FIRED!”\nOver the past four days, there have been MASSIVE movements of troops, equipment and supplies WITHIN the continental United States (CONUS). Today (Tue.), the US Navy is positioning Aircraft carriers and their strike groups off both the US east and west coasts. It appears we are preparing to defend ourselves from an invasion. China?\nLate Saturday, no fewer than 25 C-17 aircraft were in the skies over the USA, carrying troops and equipment from around the nation . . . ALL going to Nellis Air Force Base. (Story Here).\nAlso late Saturday, no fewer than 12 C-130 aircraft were also on the move, ALSO ALL heading into Nellis.\nMAP\nOn Sunday, locals on and around Nellis reported the base was “swarming” with soldiers and Marines. They also reported seeing a vast array of land fighting vehicles coming out of cargo aircraft.\nNAVAL DEPLOYMENTS\nThis morning, according the the US Naval Institute, the Navy has deployed THREE (3) Aircraft Carriers, plus a Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) off the US West Coast, and TWO (2) Aircraft carriers and their Strike Groups plus another LHD off the US East Coast.\nOff the West Coast is the USS Carl Vinson in the Pacific (NOT AT PORT) along the Oregon/Washington Border, the USS Essex (LHD) off the coast of San Francisco, and the USS Theodore Roosevelt and its Strike Group off the coast of Los Angeles . . .\nOff the East Coast are the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower off the Coast of Connecticut, the USS Gerald R. Ford off the coast of New Jersey, and the USS Iwo Jima off the coast of South Carolina . . .\nThe map below lays out the approximate location of the vessels:\nGiven these new naval deployments, and the very large, sudden, movement of troops into Nellis AFB, one gets the impression that the United States is preparing to defend its homeland from actual invasion.\nHint: That may actually be the case.\nWord in Intelligence circles says that if the Supreme Court voids any or all of the November 3 election due to the massive fraud and violations of the US Constitution with changes to election laws, the lawless extension of voting for weeks, in violation of 3 USC 1 & 2, the Democrats are planning on asking the United Nations to INVADE to depose Trump as a “Dictator.” There is also word within Intelligence circles that the states of California, Oregon, and Washington, plus New York, might actually try to secede from the Union if Trump gets four more years, and may need to be forcibly brought back under US control, the same way renegade southern states were handled back in the 1860’s Civil War.” (HT Note: It would gladden my heart to see the US military bombing egomaniac Governor Andrew Cuomo and filthy Commie NYC Mayor Bill DeBlasio back into the Union . . . or to Kingdom come . . .)\nChina and Russia are deploying their naval assets in such a way that transit to the US would not take long!\nChina is positioning out in the Pacific.\nJust this morning, the British revealed they have been tracking “the entire Russian Northern Fleet” off the British Coast this month, as the Russians head out into the North Atlantic for . . . . something. (Story HERE)\nOne possibility is they are heading toward the Mediterranean to deal with Syria and perhaps Turkey. But what if they’re **NOT** going into the Mediterranean? What if they’re positioning out in the Atlantic to arrive as “requested” along the US East Coast?\nIt sounds corny, but we won’t know until we know and that will be a few days.\nStay tuned folks. We’re seeing history unfolding.\nAs a precaution, we remind you that your firearms need cleaning and oiling; especially if you haven’t used them in awhile. They collect dust, develop surface rust in the barrel. Now might be a good time to take them out, clean them, oil them, and make sure they are in pristine condition. Don’t want any jamming or misfires if we suddenly find ourselves having to shoot and kill invading foreign troops, invited here by Traitors . . . who would also have to be shot and killed.\nUPDATE 12:03 AM EST WEDNESDAY, 9 DECEMBER —\nAttorney Lin Wood, who is known to be working closely with President Trump concerning the theft of the November 3 Election by crooked Democrats, posted __this__ interesting item on his Twitter feed.

Be vigilant and be safe !!!\nAny earthquakes in your area noted?\nOnly google search after reading this today was a reported 3.0 earthquake o miles from Calais Dec 9th at 7:31. I don’t have cable so didn’t hear about anything. No news feeds on fb from local news either. Hmmm\n😂😂😂\nI searched using duck duck 🦆 go; USA Today, Reuters and the AP had articles RE: Maine earthquake and the crash of an F-16 in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan last Tuesday’s…\n#PRAY✝️🇺🇸✝️🇺🇸✝️👍🏻\nIt was on Google maps\nYes, the cover story is easily found. And they say 2 small quakes happened on the border of Canada and Maine. Which is exactly where they are claiming this happened\nNever had happen with earthquake cause I live in maine. No earthquake happened here\nSame here in pittsfield\nI doan noe. Is it ???\nI’m loading 30 round clips and cleaning long guns now, mounting night vision. Don’t come into my neck of the woods…\nFolks, stop the deciduous stories. How is China going to invade or even sustain an invasion with no carriers. They have one functional carrier. One is in dry dock & another just started being built. You need air assets to sustain any invasion. Even their long range bombers would get plucked from the sky before hitting their rendezvous points. Their navy consists of transports & gun wagons. They would get decimated in any open “blue” water run out at deep sea. Troops in Canada? Maybe, but again w/o support they’d get slaughtered. “Well, what if they’re SOF troops muh?” Well, if so they lost their greatest weapon. Surprise because apparently we know they’re there.\nTheir submarines are what we should be worried about with nuke & EMP payloads. They have cranked out subs like sausages over the past several decades.Good Lord, think people before making wild ass guesses & not even knowing basic mil strategy!\nAre you kidding.. Trudeau let them in under the cover..To Practice in Cold Weather.. there’s info in lots of places, however, msm is suppressing alot of it.\nThe chynese army is training here in Canada! They are already on this continent!\nMadam, if it is true that 50,000 Chinese troops were killed in Maine, you would have to consider they came across Canada’s border with us. Plus if no A/C were heard, they could have been taken out with Cruise Missiles and other devices. It has been reported by several Patriots in Canada that China has already moved many Chinese troops inside their border, not to mention the thousands of deep operatives both in Canada and The US. The best advice I can give is to believe what you want, but make sure you and your family are right with JESUS CHRIST and make sure your weapons and ammo are handy! I hope if all is well I would like to wish you and your family a very Merry CHRISTmas and a safe and wonderful New Year! Take care and GOD bless!\nDid you know in Texas the Chinese have a hugh land that they bought up with armed guards stationed at electrical gate, fencing all around the property and massive buildings on property like to hold a whole army so they may already be here in the States\nTotally etc response..Am really isolated here in Calgary..it sux to be injured..am recuperating slowly..been in love with Q& America since forever..all I can add is..the Chinese I know. here are#1-in awe of Mao etc..OR BETTER yet..#2-GLAD to be free of Mao’s communism.\nI heard a few years back they were already staging in Mexico too.\nOh hush, making sense isn’t any fun. Logical thought has no part in this.😁\nMaybe that’s why they need the Russian fleet, which can easily match what the US has. Chinese men(cannon fodder) and Russian equipment…..scary thought, making me hope I’m dead wrong….\neasily matched?!?! USA has an insane army. Correct me if im wrong but USA has like 70% of the worlds militairy budget. Next to that like 100 million civilians with arms from which a lot are veterans. The most advanced weapons and xperience. What wars has China been fighting?\nNext to that USA is Energy independant and still has the reserve currency. And what do you think EU will do being so anti Russia? 50.000 soldiers blown up what a bullshit story, did they line up like in these parades pfffffffffff. It is interesting to see troop movements and ships in position. But seeing the fraud and outside interference not so strange.\nIn WW2, several of the tanks that China used were supplied by Russia.\nRed Dawn 1 and 2 combined, yep, only way they can do it, but, they hate each other.\nBecause they were going to get assistance from the Russians, dumbass.\nThey have 2 carriers\nWas the Virus Military Strategy? They started invading America about 20 yrs ago, with basic Military strategy. America was asleep\nYup\nAgreed\nThey started invading the wombs of Western Women 50 years ago, they don’t need to fight with military, they only need to wipe out your DNA using your own women against you.\nChineese Troops are reported as being already report massed in Mexico and Canada both in preparation of an imminent invasion.\nThey have alligned with the cartels in Mexico, our boarder agents have caught shipments of ChiCom grenade launchers, along with Drop in mechanisims to convert AK47 and AR15 to full automatic. This is in California Sheriffs Dept and prosecuters are trying to stop new district Attorney from releasing convicted felons charged with attempted Murder and convictions for Murder. From prisons throughout California. They say because of COVID-19, We say give them vacine keep them in prison. When things don’t seem right they usually are not.\nIt would take weeks for an invasion force big enough to invade . Plus 5,000 miles accross the Pacific to sustain it.\nNot realistic. A force of 1 million minimum would be required with another 500,000 in reserve.\nMaybe so. But don’t miscalculate Canada. The shitty PM has had Chinese army training on Canadian soil. Story broke headlines around the world a few days ago\nThey come via underground tunnels- which connect tap the dumbs.\nThey have been allowed in to Canada for years using Cargo ships into Vancouver. This has been happening since 2015 and has gotten worse since\nActually One EMP would take out all electronics in the Northern Hemisphere ! We would not be able to communicate with each other and there would be kaios everywhere ! We’d be killing ourselves faster than invading armies from both countries (China or Russia) ! They could invade from all sides and take over easily ! Texas will hold its ground and be the last taken !\nAS SOON AS ANY ACTION AGAINST US WAS TAKEN, CHINA AND RUSSIA WOULD DISAPEAR. KNOCK OFF THE BULL SHIT !!!!!\nwell China was doing war games in and with Canada so you tell me\nCould they be using our unused D.U.M.B.S. to travel and recieve mission plans above?\nEMP WOULD KNOCK OUT ALL MILITARY ELECTRONICS LEAVING US DEFENSELESS. I HAVE HEARD PROPHESIES ABOUT EXACTLY THAT.\nThe Prophesies state that Russia would be the country to hit us with an EMP\nSeem to know a lot about this.. what’s your background?\nOne it is called prepositioned equipment, two if are in a treaty with Russia you do not need your AC you ask your alley for the help, third have friends who would be willing to sell out their country.\nKristen is on point:\nThey have one soviet era tanker which was converted to carry aircraft- it is actually a diesel ……. their first nuclear isn’t due until 2024……..\nThere will never be a successful invasion as Americans have 2A- and a shit ton of ammo- Seattle, Portland, SF, Boston……. maybe …… but hell they could just fly in on Unitied and buy a couple of buildings…..\nThey don’t have to be here long enough for a sustained engagement. It can be enough to disable communications or destroy energy supply platforms. Steal information on assets, kidnap officials or military personnel and then slip back to Canada. Remember he who dares wins!!! All warfare is deception. Build the largest NAVY in the world and then attack by land. Don’t think for a second it can’t happen.\nExactly, this story has been put out by ultra right extremists to drive up action against the left. While I am a Trump supporter and a long time conservative, gun owner, Constitutionalist, I don’t condone nor fall for such outlandish stories. Vancouver BC has Stanley Park where there were supposedly Chinese troops housed (also false). China couldn’t afford a war, they are positioning themselves to take Taiwan with the go-ahead from Biden who will invade N. Korea. And while this may seem like a conspiracy, Trudeau (Fidel the younger) is going for a gun grab by Christmas with the aide of an event to shock and outrage Canadians who will shout for a gun confiscation.\nIn my humble opinion; as an ex-military, I’ve been following this military operation, and couldn’t help but remember how the CCP has no regards for human life. They want all the land that they can steal and invade, so they can grow food, extract resources etc… That’s all I have to say.\nThere are Chinese troops in Canada. And there have been for years. Go look on the CBC website.\nSpell much?\nAgree patriot Also the Russians? Really? They hate China as much as we do–and would not team up with them against us. Anyone check for dumbs in the area wit the “quake?”\nEMP is what we should worry about especially from the satellites. But we have already been under attack for a long time in Spies and Cyber attacks. Our company was invaded before I retired. We had to hire a special team of IT experts to route out and change our security to avoid further attacks. I am positive our government and military have also been Cyber invaded. Anything connected to the Net is vulnerable. Even closed links with USB or other transfer methods, because there are so many Chinese spies deployed and embedded.\nhttps://youtu.be/-Mw58r0FkNo\nAnd you ma’am should do your homework! The fact that china has had troops down south working with the cartels for a decade or so. And and that china now has THE LARGEST MILITARY ON THE PLANT,and the fact that they have almost half the world’s population in one country…and so on. You are in fact the very reason WE THE PEOPLE are in this position KAREN. WAKE UP SHEEPLE ITS HAPPENING.\nActually I’ve heard several stories well before this one that there are upwards of 75k Chinese troops in Canada and 10s of thousands in Mexico. They’ve been lying in wait for some time.\nAs you stated, the subs can be nuclear equipped and launch EMP attacks that are impossible to stop given their closeness to the US border. With the EMP wiping out the US electrical grid, and any tools, machines, vehicles etc that rely on computers to function (ie ALL mechanized tools these days) it would be a far different story should the Chinese invade. Or, the EMP attack on the USA could be a deterrent to the USA coming to the aid of Taiwan as the Communists try to re-unite the island to their dictatorship. Just look how brazenly they have subjugated Hong Kong!\nJust very odd , just heard on uk sky news , that UK vessels were deployed to their coast to protect their fishing vessels , incase of trouble after the Brexit talk failures , very fishy story indeed , not to mention Russian navy just sailed through the english channel within the week .\nyup they were escorted through channel, but more alarminly is the amount of airspace incursions and dry runs the Russians are increasingly invading western airspace just to see what our scrambling times are and protocols to check for any weaknesses, but we have been doing the same to them for years in Russian border satellite states, bio warfare is the real scary one if they get GRU members to detonate novichok bio weapons in strategic places\nOnce you are done in the US and gotten rid of big media, deep state, big tech and all those spies for the ccp of China please ask Trump to send 100 marines, offshore fire power, some drones and the necessary military intel to Holland where I’ll take over the country in the name of God, next Germany and then the rest of Europe.. Praise The Lord!\nThis shit is hilarious. Love it! My aunt sent me a text of this story freaking out asking if I “heard” about this hahaha. I was like…you’ve got to be kidding me. Lol. This reminds me of that website the Onion.\nHey Brian…. would you suggest watching the suppressive main stream media?\nSo what is so hilarious? I don’t get it!\nJust because you’re dumb doesn’t mean the rest of us have to be.\nExcept that the Onion was well-written and funny.\nYup. Thank you. Numb it’s that don’t even know basic military or operational strategy.\nApparently, you don’t know basic military strategy eithet.\nSo why did we just deploy 5 Carrier Strike groups off of both coasts and moving all of these troops around?\n“Betcha dem UFO’s attackin too. Dey showed dem Chinee souljers how to bee invisable.\nJames you’re actually correct!!\nThe aliens will be in the mix also!\nAaaaaahhhhhh….!!!!! Phuck that scheiss!\nLOTS OF NUTS OUT THERE NEVER HERD SO MUCH BULLSHIT\nIt’s true\nHe who mocks eats fortune cookie last. -—Chinese proverb\nFirst step should be to embargo China. See if they can turn rice into diesel, gasoline and motor oil.\nHahaha this is all bs a bunker buster bomb really guy where is the crater ? I live in maine if there was 50k troops making land fall mang would have been deployed quick the fuck is wrong with you spreading shit like this\nDid you not see where there was one military plane shot down.. in Michigan, they can’t find the pilot.. another in Maine. They’re hiding in Canada where Trudeau invited them under the guise of “To Help Train In Cold Weather.”\nYes, the cover story is easily found. And they say 2 small quakes happened on the border of Canada and Maine. Which is exactly where they are claiming this happened\nDid you not feel the ground shudder in Maine ?\nOthers there have said they thought it was an earthquake of about a 3.2 on the scale !\nThat was supposed to have been the Chinese bunker blast !\nGeeeesssshhhhh! Don’t you know how to read! The bunker was waaaayyyyy deep under ground. Stephen King showed them the way through the sewers of Derry\nTaken with a grain of salt.\nWWIii? Is this information confirmed? OMG!\nMay God bless the United States of America\nСмешные, вы, американцы. Нахрен вы России не нужны.\nRussian translated: Funny, you Americans. Fxxk Russia doesn’t need you\nВсем нужна Америка\nЗабавно, ты мудак. Никто не хочет, чтобы ты\ncrazy Iven reply in English please if you can\nЯ не думаю, что Путин или русские хотят быть захваченными глобалистами больше, чем мы, американцы. а глобалисты хотят одного мирового правительства. так что посмотрим.\nMay God bless the United States of America and Donald Trump\nYes AMEN and he is this is ALL UNFOLDING and if its not all exact it should put us back in GOD’S GRACE. I PLEAD THE PRECIOUS BLOOD ON ALL WHO BELIEVES IN HIM.\nI live on the Maine – New Brunswick border.\nThis is BS.\nEarthquakes happen all of the time here.\nWhich side? I’m about an hour from the Maine/NB border on the\nCA side.\nAnd how many eq a year do you get?\nI was trying to figure out where they would put 50K troops with out the eagle eyed citizens Maine not seeing them… that’s way more than would fit in the corner laundromat. I’ve seen 10K troops – that is a butt load of people and machines. Besides, wouldn’t you guys just sick Stephen King on them and drive them insane (or translate some of his scariest stuff and freak them out? )\nThey were in underground bunkers.. there’s a radio show where an ex cia guy that still has connections was telling about it. It’s all over the internet..\nSurely you’ve heard of DUMBs….hundreds of thousands of miles of them (Deep Underground Military Bases) that tax payers in Canada and USA have been paying for for years. UN has its own force, also paid for by Canada and USA.\nIt would be a great discussion if people did a little research first, to bring them up to speed on the facts.\nThe were in a D.U.M.B. deep underground military base. They supposedly knew where they were and retaliated for the plane loss with a bunker buster bomb in the DUMB\nDUMB—Deep Underground Military Base\nYou ever heard of DUMBS????? Do your research & WTFU!\nYes it has been the military rescuing the trafficked children & blowing the tunnels up when cleared. Worldwide! 2 million saved sincr Covid started. It was never a disease but a commin cold. Pandemic set up by Dems. So Trymo started raiding the 250 tunnels in US & hundreds abroad. How do you think drigs, arms & humans are trafficked? In the tunnels. There are cities below our feet all hidden from us for decades.\nMilitary has been training D.U.M.Bs warfare.\nDeep Underground Military Base\nSupposedly the bunker buster was dropped on one.\nExactly. Can you imagine 50,000 extra people suddenly in Washington County, where there are only 20,000 folks, and no one notices? I know the area, too–any boat bigger than a lobster boat gets attention, because there’s nothing else going on and people are curious.\nAbsurd.\nThis is the best one in years.Problem is you have to feed 50,000 people the flaw in plan is not enough Chinese resturaunts localy with basements to hide and feed them.\nThis also reminds me of a UK Russian vodka advert, 30 years ago where lots of Russian spies dressed as Englishmen in city suits and bowler hats carrying umbrellas were asking people which way to English factory making better vodka. Might be noticeable in small village, as Chinese in full battle dress. Same principal.\nNot if they’re traveling through underground bunkers.. like he said.\nIf the fight was underground, why would you see troops above??\nThere are tunnels throughout the country that have been used for transporting illegal trafficking, but are now being seized by the military.\nUnderground is where thw military have been training for years now.\nThey are not operating above ground…they are in DUMBs (Deep Underground Military Bases) Please, for your own sake, do your research.\nIf this is true; wouldn’t the president have a call to arms to all the militias, patriots and the veterans ? I’d would love to receive your emails on truthful news.\nit is coming\nWhat do you consider truthful news?\nThe Supreme Court has blindfolds on and does not see anything other than the law. If they let this influence them and do nothing we get China anyway. So it is time for a showdown and call the bluff. Also, the best defense is an offense. Knock out all China’s dams and water storage facilities and move to place large holes on major runways. All this can be done from a distance.\nI totally agree. Not sure what country we are living with all of this corruption which has infiltrated the core of our society. If Biden and Harris get in, we are screwed. Our only shining light is the one Trump is shining.\nNope, the ONLY light we can depend on is that from JESUS CHRIST. Never put your faith and trust in a man, but rather put your faith and trust in the Lord God Almighty.\nTotally agree!!! Jesus is the only answer!! To Him be the glory! But I still get caught up in the worldly crapolla!!! I find myself leaning in this conservative craze and following the maniacs. God forgive me!\nTrump isn’t going anywhere unless they kill him. He’s got this!\nMilitary Intelligence Just wait —\nWhat a bunch of garbage. Sadly there’s people that will actually believe this. What a joke\nI’m glad our fate as a country aren’t in people like you! If you think these threats aren’t real i’d suggest pulling your head out of you rectum.\nYup this is true! People are not goimg to be expecting this. Completely take people by surprise. Not even Q anon followers will know the magnitude.. Its going to get hot\nCommunists haven’t spend a century infiltrating to take us from within to at the last moment have their own countries turned into a smoldering wasteland. They know the president would deploy our nuclear deterrent if an actual attack on the homeland were at hand.\nThe tunnels are so deep and wide. Military has been training to fight underground for several years . This is open news. Yes there has been abundance of military activity. Yes trafficking is one part of underground tunnels. I didn’t believe clones existed but CIA involved. Notice all the changes Trump has made with military and Intel briefings. Whatever is happening, like the confiscation of servers in Germany from CIA, military folks saying we’re at war. There are maps of the tunnels. Globalists Marxism and Central Banks and technocrats. France and China announced their transhuman military. We’ll wait and see.\nThey have alligned with the cartels in Mexico, our boarder agents have caught shipments of ChiCom grenade launchers, along with Drop in mechanisims to convert AK47 and AR15 to full automatic. This is in California Sheriffs Dept and prosecuters are trying to stop new district Attorney from releasing convicted felons charged with attempted Murder and convictions for Murder. From prisons throughout California. They say because of COVID-19, We say give them vacine keep them in prison. When things don’t seem right they usually are not.\nNot if he’s out of office… Biden is a Chinese asset. He won’t do anything to China. He’ll hand the US over on a silver platter. Why do you think he and Harris had to win at all costs?\n50/50 chance. What if it is true? You’ll feel pretty stupid, won’tcha?\nNo real chance at all. Won’t you feel stupid when Biden takes office and Nothing serious (except, hopefully, the arrest of DJT and family) happens.\nYouare a retard …… joe jr lmfao old perv joe isnt going anywhere except his basement prison with his sister jill gtfoh idiot\nsounds like you have a bad case of tds\nYou really think that is this was true Trump would be sitting at the football game today?China’s sending troops over the border and Russia China navy close to US coast. Yeah lets go to a football game.\nLike Bush was deliberately in Florida when the twin towers were taken down? Plausible deniability of any action.\nYou should look up USNI before you talk shit\nIf it were in times of Pearl Harbor you would be saying the same ………..maybe just maybe it is the perfect excuse for Marital law.\nAnd then forced vaccinations.\nno vaccines, POTUS said it is 95% defective.unsafe, this is another sting to take down evil big pharma.\nIt is coming …..\nYes and no. I’d it true to the core. I don’t know every story has some elaboration to it but this is what I do know , Canada’s prime minister is totally in sync with the Chinese regime.. that is no secret that this PM admires the Chinese dictatorship and it is well known that he does not like the US with Canada already allowing so much infiltration honestly it doesn’t seem to far fetched anymore. #fellowcanadian #livingunderdictatorship\nYou know what strikes me now. I was 10 years old when JFKennedy was murdered. I had no political knowhow at all, my parents didn’t tell me anything ( it was the early sixties) they had no idea either. The night after the murder I woke-up after a very disturbing dream. I felt very sad because I knew a very important person had died ( I never heard from JFK before) and I had seen that we should fear China. They would come to take the world. I felt very upset that day and I never forgot how I felt. Now I think I had a preview of these days,\nI had a dream about two years ago where I saw Chinese troops on US soil. I woke up terrified.\nWell youre correct!!\nHonestly this has been planned for.\nAlot will go down but weve also got alot of protection. Amazing weaponry and a surprise at the end..\nYou’re a sensitive. You should try meditation. It can help bring your visions clearer.\nOh wow how prophetic. It was a vision of how these times could be. I still don’t think my friends who voted how the did,understand what they’ve done\nSure, turn on CNN, they’ll inform you as always…lol\n😮 Good memory Tamarinde, had a similar when going thru that period in history, thanks for reminding me\nIts ironic you mentioned your dream..I had a dream in 2007 that Chinese military were marching in TX. I dreamt that the streets, malls and highways looked desolate and nobody was driving cars or out. Only saw Chinese marching together and they saw a big church by freeway with a huge supernatural light on top of it..and they marched away from it. I always wondered about that dream and now Im reading that CCP owns some of our government ppl and China also purchased 130k acres in China. They also have a Toyota plant in TX. Something is up.\nYes, I had the same Kennedy/Cuba/China experience growing up. We were told to never trust China.\nI don’t believe this. If true some news outlet somewhere would be reporting.\nNo they won’t be reporting this, MSM is owned and operated by the far-left.. PERIOD…. they want you asleep at the wheel..unprepared! PREPARE AMERICA….. Better to be safe than sorry!\nMSM is all comparatively right wing. It’s only leftist in the fever dreams of RWNJs and white evangelical Christians. They call it leftwing because MSM isn’t racist right-wing enough for their taste.\nWho do you think you’re fooling? your pet tarantula? Inverting all values into their opposites up to reality itself is the MO of Communist propaganda (and the Satanism underlying it). It works if it disorients the weak-minded, but it also works on those who see through you, if your chortling, brazen lie as exact opposite of the truth maddens them to fury.\nMay the Ancient of Days say to you at the Judgment: “Depart from me, ye cursed, into eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels.”\nThe best disinfectant of vermin like you in this life is not anger but reality.\nThe MSM is right-wing compared to what? Even billionaire-funded Lenin and Trotsky weren’t to the left of your ilk on billionaire teevee. You evaded committing yourself to anyone specific because the inversion of reality can’t co-exist with the slightest whiff of reality itself. If you breathe a word of truth that your lies might be compared to, the spell is broken in that instant.\nYour racist hatred of whites disqualifies you to complain about anyone’s racism, even if white evangelicals WERE racist, which all can plainly see they are not. It doesn’t matter if you are white. Quisling was a Norwegian who helped Hitler invade Norway, and his name is now synonymous with treason. He was an honorable man comapred to YOU. You slime have been around since the world began.\nDon’t you dare accuse innocent people of everything you’re guilty of. The Satanic inversion has already been exposed. It maybe worked for a season years ago, but the Availing Time has come to an abrupt end. You and your fallen Father have great wrath indeed because you both know you’re time is short.\nYou’re an ignorant snowflake\nThe MSM believe they will be treated so kindly when and if an invasion takes place. Not that I see the future, but I’m pretty sure the communists have no need for American media – of any type, and will line up and execute them after they have conquered us.\nExactly…all those that think they are working towards a “greater future” with communism will be the first ones purged. Including all the lefty university professors waxing nostalgic for Mao and Uncle Joe Stalin.\nman if you don’t know by now the news media lies to you every day there really is no hope for you\nThere are none.\nafter reading this there was a video coming up with the blaze… it was blocked\nTell us which “news outlet” you think we can trust to tell us anything true? Dope.\nNewsmax\nOur fake news? How long has Hunter Biden’s lap top been hidden?\nI hope this is not true either. Unfortunately, our mass media is extremely bias and hasn’t been reporting the truth for a very long time.\njust like they reported on hunter’s laptop that the fbi has???\nOh yeah cause the fake News is so damn trustworthy! Are you kidding me?\nDid you know in Texas the Chinese have a hugh land that they bought up with armed guards stationed at electrical gate, fencing all around the property and massive buildings on property like to hold a whole army so they may already be here in the States\nYes, in Del Rio. They named it Morning Star , it’s supposed to be a wind farm.\nSure, turn on CNN, they’ll inform you as always…lol\nWhy would China … err I mean some “news outlet” warn you?\nIt appears SOME NEWS OUTLET is reporting, just not mainstream media who also have failed to report a lot of very relevant issues of late, every one of which could have been damaging to key Democrats, or vindicating of allegations against Republicans. Some news outlets have reported, with evidence of voter fraud,, but never in mainstream media. I go in with an open mind awaiting irrefutable confirmation, however I would now NEVER believe main stream media reporting.\nWe need to take out Obama, the clintons and Biden. The democrats are destroying everything. Its time to clean this shit up. Let’s not forget about the witch (Pelosi) and her nephew (Newsome). The fucking democrats are sore losers and this is how they respond?!!!!!! What a bunch of pussies!!!!!!. They are stealing this election because they knew they were going to lose and this covid 19 which we know isn’t a threat anymore but the democrats want is to believe that its picking back up so they can control us. Many of us who served to have our freedom including me will not bend to this bullshit. What has happened to this world and what have we created for our kids and families have these human beings lost their minds to think they are doing good ?????!!!!!!!!! Fuck these people for trying to take my freedom away.\nAs a Veteran and Father, I’m with you! Over my dead fucking body will I let a bunch of communist take this from us! Locked & Loaded in Michigan!\nYes Don be ready!\nPlease have food and water stored for friends and family.\nYou are absolutely right! I know for damn sure I won’t bend a knee for anyone, but the Lord my God! I am beyond sick of the incompetent DEMOCRAT’s/RINO’S trying to destroy our nation! There are millions upon millions ready to take up this fight against Tyranny and I say we start cleaning out the SWAMP because These rates are multiplying like cockroaches and we just need to turn on the lights and start stomping until none are left standing.\nAmen Mark! We agree thousand percent with you and your post. My husband and you sound exactly the same! Newscum destroying Commiefornia.\nAmen Mark! We agree thousand percent with you and your post. My husband and you sound exactly the same! Newscum destroying Commiefornia.\nYes thats right Gina!\nCalifornia is screwed. Nobody has guns or artiliary. Were gonna sink quick\nNow this is true….\nNot the MSM they are crap. I called my local News station out here in Seattle/Tacoma.Then I asked them why they dont say anything positive about our POTUS and the voter fraud. They BLEW ME OFF and HUNG UP\nI totally agree.\nI agree with you 100 percent. The DEMONCRATS are purposely destroying America with every avenue of attack they have at their disposal including our own allies and foreign enemies. We must turn our energies as patriotic citizens to fight for the sovereignty and freedom that we currently have as American citizens. Anyone not on our side should be removed from American soil\nThumbs up!!!! Yesssss\nyep.\nWhy does everyone forget the Bush family mafia is part of this mess?\nAMEN & thank you gore your service. Those goons have no idea who they’re messing with.\nDo you realise that you’re a walking caricature of how we (the rest of the world) view America. Angry, semi-literate and poorly educated, limited worldview and a poor limited brain susceptible to conspiracy theories and misinformation. Poor little man. We are laughing at you. Your days are numbered. The people have spoken and Donald Trump is fired.\nand YOUR view of us is exactly why this will never end the way you see America!\nSorry dude you think your intelligent. But the CIA has been feeding you….. Youll aoon find out how right we are… Whem the bombs drop just remember whos intelligent\nYou are not ‘the rest of the world’world\nForeigners are much more deceived than leftists in America, if you can believe it. But, of course, they listen pretty much only to CNN, BBC, The Guardian, etc. The worst. And they think they’re getting reality. Now that’s funny!\nIt’s true the people have spoken and they elected President Trump. So up yours snowflake\nThat would mean that hospitals are murdering people that ordinarily walk in with other symptoms but fake a Covid test and claim them as Covid-19 to get paid the $33000 per patient they get paid by Gvt to treat them. Nd bcs they shove a pipe down their throats and don’t allow family in to defend it…they are murdering them. Simple like that. STOP THE GVT PAYMENT AND COVID-19 ENDS.\nMan I am with you 1000% Fuck these assholes! It’s time to clean this mess up ourselves\nI believe it is being done even as we speak.The truth of it will come out early next year. We are almost there.\nRest easy\nnot one single shred of evidence or anything , show even 1 dead chinese soldier on american soil…..\nthis is all misleading… “david”\nBabylon B?\nHey a lot of fools still bLIEve Sandy Hook happened with absolutely no evidence of any of it!!!!!\nWill be the shortest war in history\nTrue very short!\nbut it was kept hush by the CIA media goons\nYa going to need more evidence for this attack dude! Pictures of fighting, dead bodies, damage, actual combat equipment and troops in route. Something other than a old burnt out hippy type guy talking to a cell phone! I am a vet and second hand rumors of wars don’t pass the smell test.\nI know with former presidents all our business was out in the open, however being classified is Kind of a thing with the military\nA citizen feels the same, I agree.\nAndrea, NH\nThank you, God bless PDT, and all Ight Workers🕊\nThk u!! I did hear the radio show. My friend in Canada sent it to me. Pls. Everyone remember, it’s not the Canadian ppl. Against us…..its their PM…prime minister Treudou!! He invited the Chinese to come and train there!!! Canadians want him OUT OF OFFICE!!! Please remember that!!! The ppl are just as infuriated as we are!!!… also on a separate issue….consider using Duck Duck Go. Instead of google!!! Duck duck go NEVER tracks u!! And pray!!!\nThis IS WW3 and they won-t win, waiting for some arrests and decaps !!!\nThe news networks are owned by china thats why they are not reporting it and I tried to share on social media they shut down all my accounts\nIt’s a silent war for a reason, Everyone is impatient for marshal law/insurrection but just because POTUS isn’t telling us doesn’t mean he’s not cleaning up as much as possible before the war hits main street. You can’t put the Jeanie back in the bottle so I’m sure it’s buying us more time to secretly clean up the demons before the rest of them start their chaos.. SCOTUS will need to rule before Monday so I’m sure we will know something soon. GOD BLESS AMERICA & PRESIDENT TRUMP & THE US MILITARY.\nAmen brother!\namen to that <3\nRelax people its BS\nI dont take anything as lightly but dont TRUST CHINA…LOOK AT THE CORRUPTION IN OUR COUNTRY AND WHO THEY ALLOW IN….SO I KEEP ONE EYE OPEN AND LLOK TO THE LORD.\nThis is pure bull shit ! Why in the hell would you publish such lies… You are not helping the cause… Stop this crap NOW!\nHey Doug, STFU and go watch some MSM where they wouldn’t dare lie to anyone.\nOne of my old squad leaders in Iraq is now the Assistant to the Sergeant Major of the Army at the Pentagon and informed me that this is FAKE NEWS… But who knows, if if were tru, he couldn’t tell me anyways… OPSEC.\nDude can you post some evidence instead of just saying this\nIf you are reading this comment, you are stupid.\nThere will be battles, blackouts, riots, earthquakes and floods. Don’t take the vax containing Gates’ Hell control, mRNA making you a chimera. Your body is the temple. If you take the Beastmark you can’t go to Heaven. See Session 7 Lancaster Prophecy Conference\nSorry dude you think your intelligent. But the CIA has been feeding you….. Youll aoon find out how right we are… Whem the bombs drop just remember whos intelligent\nI was coming back from an appointment about 40 miles north of Bangor and the disc jockey on the radio said their was a 3.1 earthquake in northern Maine near the Canadian border. I didn’t believe any of it.\nFuck china !\nMy God you are an idiot!!!!! Need some clickbait? Run back to your bunker you moron!\nWelcome to Trumptard land or alternate reality if you like…Those conspies are getting funnier and funnier everyday!\nSorry dude you think your intelligent. But the CIA has been feeding you….. Youll soon find out how right we are… Whem the bombs drop just remember whos intelligent.\nNeed more proof\nWhat a load of crap this is! Talk about fake news. This is a very dangerous incitement to the people of the USA. Please stop posting this crap!\nI agree, I seen this on TickTock. Took me about 10 min and it is thoroughly heresy and NOTHING substantial. I totally believe 9-11 was an inside job, titanic got us into the Federal Reserve.. Yotta yotta. I can elaborate my logic convincingly. The Minister in Canada passed a bill in 2019 to allow Chinese troops to train in Canada. That’s why Im following leads. I’m not ruling this out 100% but it’s absurd to report this because there is absolutely no evidence which is negligent journalism.\nTo those who doubt the legitimacy of this much like the news that there has been attacks between India and China (legitimate events) but yet it’s not widely known, this could also be the case.\nYou were just shared with me by a friend. Thank you for keeping us informed. Please continue.\nThanks and God Bless\nWhat if… just what if:\n– Traitor Trudeau invited Chinese troops to “train in winter conditions in Canada” (see https://www.rebelnews.com/the_china_files); this is official now\n– The last thing President Trump needs at this time are Chinese soldiers on North American soil\n– The patriots have exhausted all legal avenues for stopping the fall of the US into the hands of criminals (looks like the Supreme Court rejected “the Texas against Pennsylvania case”)\n– Maybe the location and numbers of people in this piece of information are not necessarily exact (by mistake of on purpose)\n– The only way the patriots are left with is military action against external and internal enemies (watch what happens in California)\n– In case this puzzle (inevitably incomplete) begins to make any sense, maybe you should rush to the store and buy some food and ammunition…\nI live in Vegas and the skies are quiet as a mouse! This whole article is a CROCK OF SHIT! More fear spreading PROPAGANDA NAZI LIES!\nThat’s good to hear that from someone in Vegas. I live bout 45 minutes from where this is supposed to have happened an it WAS an earthquake although it be small, i have friends that actually felt the rumble of the earth. No explosion of bunker busting bombs an no sight of ANY chinaman on either side of the border as i have friends on Canadian side as well. We do have all are weaponry cleaned oiled and ready as most rednecks do anyway! An this whole coffee shit has opened our eyes to build up our supply of ammo too? Bless you fellow Patriot an may God bless you an yours!!!\nThis is complete LARP. Research what you read. This guys was from my home state. All birds have been grounded until investigation. Quit reading Turners trash!\nJust very odd , just heard on uk sky news , that UK Naval vessels were deployed to their coast to protect their fishing vessels , incase of trouble after the Brexit talk failures , very fishy story indeed , not to mention Russian navy just sailed through the english channel within the week .\nFifty thousands Slopes dead in Maine?

I guess from the corpses, because somehow I I the CCP would send US a list of MIA.\nSo where are these corpses?\nAll pulverized, disintegrated, buried underground as a result of a the dread explosion? Alright…\nSo where is the crater? I’d like to see some pics. And zid like to hear from any witnesses?\nI smell something funny here.\nNo, it’s not Napalm\nNo, no no, its true. Today is the 12th. America has been overrun. Every citizen is currently under house arrest. Chinese mafia and Russian kgb have taken control of DC and other strategic points of interest. All jobs will be suspended for a few weeks, then its labor camps and slave jobs for everyone. I’m sorry to report this NEWS! (propaganda) to the rest of the flat plane we live on. WWWWD? (what would william wallace do?)\nYa know, perhaps it is all a crock. But that being said, the original article is well written, articulate, and obviously well crafted. The synopsis certainly outlines a legitimate possibility…….The report certainly falls in line with another Web Site’s live feeds of increased military activity in and around the Northwest US/Canadian borders….Actually, this present Corvid Situation, the Political Fraud, and general division amongst American Citizens all gravitate to such a Nightmare Scenario actually occurring…..Personally, I pray to God it is all a well fabricated fiction, yet some doubt does remain……To immediately assume that American would immediately retaliate with nuclear weapons is really kind of insane….What is possible is that the story is valid and the Government has imposed a total black out on the incidents……Mass chaos could only occur if such information was freely dispersed…As to the assumption that 50 plus thousand undocumented Chinese troops were secretly deposited in an underground bunker awaiting Armageddon…….All killed by a ‘Bunker-Buster’ bomb….. ……Actually, very possible. Especially with the current shortcomings of Homeland Security and undocumented people entering the country…..One must also weigh in on the present Civilian and Federal Criminal Investigative Divisions and Departments and the subsequent lack of citizen support…….I am not a conspiracist by any means……but I prefer to rationalize that if the original newscast-web article IS a fabrication……it was well thought out! If nothing else, it provides an immediate “wake-up” to those less-educated or mentally unable to express themselves without profanity or derisiveness. Thank you for interesting and thought-provoking stories!!\nWhen I was very young, maybe 5 on up, I had many dreams of Chinese invasion. It was terrifying. Eventually the dreams stopped but I never forgot\nThe number 50,000 is just an estimate. It is well known that DUMBs (Deep underground military bases) have been used by the deep state and CIA as traffficking locations for decades. They are pretty much hidden. The alliance has taken out most of them in the last 4 years and the bombings register as earthquake activity. So if you were China that would be a great place to station troops. not for an initial assault but to come out once there is chaos in the country and taker charge of the countryside and cities. Apparently there were Chinese troops spotted in Wisconsin and a fighter jet was scrambled to check it out. That plane was literally ionized and the pilet is missing. dead or captured. This was our retaliation. an obvious message that we know what they are up to. It is becoming known that the Demoncrats are working with the CCP to take over America and turn it into a communist country. That’s why they need the compromised Biden to win. I am confident our milirtary will not let that happen even if the courts are corrupted.\nI guess pearl harbor was are imaginations, btw I’m Afro-American and I’m seeing alot of caucasians saying this and that ain’t true, im black and see what’s coming with the stole election etc, just though so many caucasians wouldnt be brain washed.\nI’m caucasian and I hear you. People are sheep, and arrogant about it. White< Brown, Asian… Don't matter. Humans are highly susceptible to social conditioning, if you get em while they are young, you have 'em for life all too often.\nYou go D!!!\nHard to believe that an adult average intellectual person writes such a trash.\nDo you know any ex Military that does not keep their weapons in the ready ?\nMy Oath Does Not Expire ….\nЗабавно, ты мудак. Никто не хочет, чтобы ты\nWhy in the heck would Russia or China care one iota about the damned election fraud? Why do Americans see EVERYTHING happening in the world as US-centric? Makes me sick. Surely Americans can’t be THAT dumb. 50,000 Chinese troops massacred on US soil?? Lol!\nChina is not one to sit on their backsides, not beef up their military and allow their enemies to win the arms war. Oh no! China has for decades partnered with countries all over Asia-Pacific and participated in hundreds of joint military exercises with state of the art military technology. Does anyone seriously expect an inscrutable nation like China, who is not only an economic superpower but also a military one, to broadcast to the world the exact details of their military prowess?\nThe focus of any military movements around the globe is actually the Middle East. Any allusions to Chinese or Russian military aggression on US soil or against the USA are pure distractions, fabricated by US leaders with nefarious agendas, and not by Chinese or Russian leaders.\nWhether you believe it or not, we are building up to the great battle of Armageddon. All the signs are there. This battle takes place in northern Israel, where Israel’s enemies will gang up on her. Iran may be the trigger which starts this war. A vast army of 100 million soldiers will approach from the east. Think about this. Which country alone has 100 million soldiers? None. China has 3 million active and reserve soldiers…officially on paper! This huge army will come from several countries east and north of Israel. Allies China and Russia each have their own sets of alliances.\nA very good reason why this crazy, scare-mongering rumour was put out. The US govt wants a reason for declaring absolute and total powers over its citizens under emergency laws.\nThis election fraud was not about Democrats running our country, it was about handing it over to China.\nI know what you mentioned about Armageddon is true. However biblical scholars also point out that America the eagle in mentioned in bible. The modern Babylonian harlot who brought sins to the world and was wealthy.It references the eagle being hit in the left and then it rises only to be brought down on other side as well. East/West coast it seems. It mentions the dragon/ China obviously and other appears to be Russia. It states the world watches it be destroyed in one hour. The bible is not automatically clear to some as it states things that are not easily understood. Requires spiritual thought and further research to cross reference. All I can say is May God Bless American and all his ppl everywhere. It so corrupt and so many sold out for the love of money, they betray one another and the people they should defend. The elite are not on Gods side, may he contend with them accordingly whomever they are.\nNot a conspie but my step son just got notice that 19000 graduates are to be deployed to fort knox.

How close to the Maine-Canadian border were they?\nWhen did this occur? Where in Canada were these Chinese soldiers based?\nWhen did they arrive? From where in China did they come? What are their Unit #s?\nOr was this an amphibious landing from the Altantic Ocean?\nIts ironic you mentioned your dream..I had a dream in 2007 that Chinese military were marching in TX.

An end is being put to the Armenia-Azerbaijan Nagorno-Karabakh conflict today. I think that the trilateral statement that has just been signed will put a full stop in resolving the issue. The statement has been signed by the President of Azerbaijan, President of Russia and Prime Minister of Armenia. I want to familiarize you with the text of the statement:\nWe, President of the Republic of Azerbaijan I. H. Aliyev, Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia N. V. Pashinyan and President of the Russian Federation V. V. Putin, declare the following:\n1. A complete ceasefire and a cessation of all hostilities in the zone of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict shall be introduced at 00:00 hours Moscow time on November 10, 2020. The Republic of Azerbaijan and the Republic of Armenia, hereinafter referred to as the Parties, shall stop at their current positions.\n2. Aghdam district shall be returned to the Republic of Azerbaijan by November 20, 2020.\n3. Along the contact line in Nagorno-Karabakh and along the Lachin corridor, a peacekeeping contingent of the Russian Federation shall be deployed in the amount of 1,960 military personnel with small arms, 90 armored personnel carriers, and 380 units of an automobile and special equipment.\n4. The peacekeeping contingent of the Russian Federation shall be deployed in parallel with the Armenian armed forces' withdrawal. The period of stay of the Russian Federation's peacekeeping contingent is five years and shall be automatically extended by a further five-year period if none of the Parties declares six months prior to the expiration of the period of its intention to terminate the application of this provision.\n5. In order to increase the effectiveness of control over the implementation of the agreements by the Parties to the conflict, a peacekeeping center shall be deployed to exercise control over the ceasefire.\n6. The Republic of Armenia shall return Kalbajar district to the Republic of Azerbaijan by November 15, 2020, and Lachin district by December 1, 2020, while retaining the Lachin corridor (5km wide), which shall provide a connection of Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia and shall not affect the city of Shusha.\nBy agreement of the Parties, a plan for the construction of a new route along the Lachin corridor shall be determined in the next three years, providing communication between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia, with the subsequent redeployment of the Russian peacekeeping contingent to protect this route. The Republic of Azerbaijan shall guarantee the safety of citizens, vehicles and goods traveling along the Lachin corridor in both directions.\n7. Internally displaced persons and refugees shall return to the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and adjacent districts under the control of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n8. The exchange of prisoners of war and other detainees and bodies of the dead shall be carried out.\n9. All economic and transport links in the region shall be restored. The Republic of Armenia guarantees the safety of transport links between the western regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in order to organize an unhindered movement of citizens, vehicles and goods in both directions. Control over transport shall be exercised by the bodies of the Border Guard Service of the Federal Security Service (FSB) of Russia.\nBy agreement of the Parties, the construction of new transport communications linking the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic with the western regions of Azerbaijan shall be ensured.\nNovember 10, 2020\nPresident of the Republic of Azerbaijan\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Armenia\nPresident of the Russian Federation\nX X X\nDear fellow countrymen, dear sisters and brothers.\nThis statement has historic significance. I must say that this statement has been signed in a videoconference format. Initially, the heads of the three states were supposed to sign the statement in this videoconference format. However, at the very last moment, the Armenian prime minister refused. This is somewhat understandable because this statement is actually tantamount to Armenia's military capitulation. Therefore, this statement was signed by the President of Russia and me in a videoconference format. This statement has been prepared in Russian. I have put my signature here. This document was submitted to the Russian Ambassador, and the heads of state and government of Russia and Armenia will sign this document afterward.\nI want to say again that this conduct by the Armenian Prime Minister Pashinyan is understandable. However, I think that everyone should be held accountable for what they do. Everyone must respect themselves, even in the most challenging and critical situations. Respect themselves and their country. Pashinyan will sign it one way or another. We have forced him to do that. But he will sign it in a confined place, in a locked-up room, far from the cameras, in a cowardly and treacherous manner. He is not signing it of his own free will. He is signing it under pressure by the iron fist!\nThis statement is our glorious victory. I am glad to be sharing this good news with the people of Azerbaijan today. One of the reasons this statement has been signed is our brilliant victory, our historic victory, the liberation of Shusha from occupation. Shusha is Karabakh's crown jewel! The liberation of Shusha has great political and strategic significance, as well as great moral importance. We have returned to Shusha, we have returned Shusha, we will live in Shusha, and people will live in all other lands liberated from occupation. People will return to those lands, live there, our people's 30-year longing will come to an end.\nI think that the reason for this statement being signed was yet another glorious military victory on November 9 – National Flag Day. On November 9, Azerbaijan's Armed Forces liberated 72 settlements from the occupiers. By liberating Shusha, by liberating 72 settlements on November 9, by liberating about 300 settlements since September 27, we broke the Armenian army's back. Pashinyan was forced to sign the statement – in a very pathetic and miserable state. I have signed this statement with great pride and joy because it puts an end to the long-standing occupation. This statement allows us the opportunity to return our other occupied regions – Aghdam, Lachin, Kalbajar – without bloodshed. There is a very short deadline; those districts will be returned to us by the end of this month. This is great happiness. I seize this opportunity to congratulate the residents of Aghdam, Lachin and Kalbajar districts, all the people of Azerbaijan, on this occasion. Every time an occupied district or city was liberated, I congratulated the residents of those cities and districts. I can imagine what it means for them. Some, perhaps many, have lost hope because the issue had not been resolved for many years. Over the past 17 years, I have been in numerous meetings with the IDPs, attended ceremonies to present them new homes, and I saw that their hopes were diminishing with every passing year. I saw it. I saw it with a sore heart. I noticed that some of them had already lost hope. Yes, they expressed their gratitude; of course, we have created the right conditions and resolved their problems.\nAs you know, the efforts for the IDPs in Azerbaijan are unique to our country. IDPs are in many countries around the world, but the situation of our IDPs is incomparably better than in other countries. But their main desire has been to return to their native lands, and they asked me, \"Mr. President, please return us there\". Every time I met with them, I saw a firm resolve, invincibility, loyalty to the state, but at the same time, I saw sorrow and longing in their eyes. It is over, my fellow compatriots, may your eyes be clear now, you are going back, we are going back, Azerbaijan is going back! Azerbaijan is restoring its territorial integrity. Could there be greater happiness?\nThe IDPs are well aware that we will do our best to help them return to their ancestral lands. We will rebuild these liberated lands. The whole world can see now what the despised enemy has done to these lands. All our buildings have been destroyed. All our historical sites have been destroyed, our museums looted, nature gravely damaged, and our mosques destroyed and desecrated. In the half-destroyed mosques in the liberated lands, the savage enemy kept pigs to insult us and hurt our pride. But we took revenge on them with a vengeance. We have avenged the victims of Khojaly. We have avenged our martyrs.\nWhile announcing Shusha's liberation to my people on November 8, I said that I bow to the memory of our martyrs. The martyrs of the First and Second Karabakh Wars will forever live in our hearts. May Allah rest all our martyrs in peace. Thanks to their heroism and self-sacrifice, we will return to our lands. May Allah heal all our wounded soldiers, may they recover soon and return to everyday life, and we will do our best for their recovery. Even our severely wounded soldiers and officers in the most challenging condition should know that we will do our best to bring them back to normality. We all owe this victory to them. They liberated our lands from the occupiers inch by inch. They raised our flag in the occupied and liberated lands. They hoisted our flag there. It is a victory for all of us, for all the people of Azerbaijan. The people of Azerbaijan have once again shown what a great nation, what a patriotic country, what a people with an iron will we are. Thirty years of suffering, 30 years of despair, 30 years of longing did not break our people, did not affect our resolves.\nOn the contrary, we have become even more united, even more robust, we said 'enough is enough', we will not tolerate this occupation any longer. We said that we would drive the enemy out of our lands! We are not interested in any negotiations. You know very well that over the past year, I did not talk about negotiations at all. I did not want to deceive my people; I never have and never will. The Azerbaijani people know this. When I said before the war that I knew what to do and when, I am sure that the vast majority of our people understood what I meant and patiently waited for this day, believed in me as President and Commander-in-Chief, believed and waited, and this day has arrived. Enough, this occupation shall end! How much longer will our cities remain under occupation? How much longer will the despised enemy pollute our nature, walk, eat, drink, dance and insult us in our lands? We said that we would show the enemy its place, drive the enemy out of our lands, and we drove them away!\nHistorians will tell what happened on September 27. I think many people know how it all started. The Azerbaijani people's patience had already run out, and I told the Armenian prime minister in recent meetings that he should not play with fire. He should not abuse the patience of the Azerbaijani people. You don't know the people of Azerbaijan well enough, you will find out what we are about, but it would be too late. Come round, get out of these lands. These lands do not belong to you. But what did they do? To conduct illegal resettlement, they brought Armenians from abroad to Shusha in a demonstrative manner, in gross violation of international law, international conventions, including the Geneva Conventions, to insult us. In Shusha, the gang leader who is now looking for a hole to hide, the leader of the junta was sworn-in, and the prime minister of Armenia attended. Wasn't that intended to infuriate us? Did they think that no-one would hold them to account for that? We did, we brought them to their knees, and they are on their knees now! There is hardly anyone he didn't call over the past 40 days, begging for help and humiliating himself. We have disgraced him, and we were absolutely right in doing so. When he danced drunk on Jidir Duzu in the sacred city of Shusha, he should have thought that this day would come. He would receive his punishment. Now he hides like a mouse as he takes this document and signs it in tears. We showed him his place. We taught him a lesson. We chased them out of our lands like dogs. I said that we would chase them, that we would chase them like dogs, and we chased them, we chased them like dogs. He is now signing this document out of fear, knowing that we will come to Aghdam, Kalbajar and Lachin. No-one can stop us. Everyone sees our strength; everyone understands what our iron fist is like. That is why we have driven them out and are perfectly right in doing that.\nWe have destroyed almost all of their military hardware. We have breached the fortifications they had built for 30 years. Our soldiers have broken through them like lions. They have crushed the enemy and were right to do so because they are on their land. We abide by international law. We respect international law. We did not take revenge on civilians, and we never will. This is why there are very few civilian casualties on the enemy side. What did they do? They could not confront us on the battlefield, fled and then fired on civilians with ballistic missiles. This is a war crime. They will be held accountable for that war crime. To strike the city of Gandja with ballistic missiles from Armenia is a disgrace, a despicable act, a crime. It is a war crime to hit Barda with cluster munitions. I said earlier that the city of Tartar is similar to Stalingrad, which was destroyed during World War II. Every day, hundreds of shells landed there. Even though it is not a big city, not a single person has left. But the Armenians fled. Their \"invincible\" army was destroyed, desertion began, and the junta head in Nagorno-Karabakh ordered that whoever ran away would be held accountable. Did any of us run away? It didn't happen! Not a single person! This is who the people of Azerbaijan are! Civilians lost their homes, property, and loved ones but kept saying, \"Long live the Motherland\". Go ahead, go forward! The letters to me say, Commander-in-Chief, go on! We support you, go forward, don't stop, and so I did. I did not stop.\nI gave about 30 interviews during this war. I have probably never given so many interviews in my entire life. Some were wondering why Ilham Aliyev did not give interviews. I thought that I had ample opportunity to express my position and often expressed my views on all matters. All my activities are transparent, and all my meetings are reported on to the public. I didn't think it necessary. But when it became necessary, I gave about 30 interviews. In those interviews, I said that we respect international law, defend international law, defend justice, and implement UN Security Council resolutions. I said that all our steps were based on international law's norms and principles, were based on morality, and all our efforts were taken to that end. We took our revenge on the enemy; we took it on the occupier. We have not dealt with and will never deal with civilians. There is no significant destruction in the cities where the enemy lives and hides because we did not open fire on civilian facilities. That is what makes us different.\nAfter the war started, I said that many, almost all politicians involved in this issue, kept saying that there was no military solution to this conflict. What was I saying? I said there was! I was often criticized. People were questioning what Ilham Aliyev was saying. They insisted that there was no military solution. I said, in that case, solve it peacefully. You have available means. You are a superpower, you have an excellent reputation, and you have tremendous capabilities.\nWhat is Armenia compared to you? Can't you influence it? Or perhaps you don't want to put pressure? No, they said it is impossible to wage war, and the issue must be resolved peacefully. Fine, a peaceful solution may be sought for one year, for two years, but 30 years? How much longer will you try to fool us? However, we have proved that there was a military solution. And I said what I wanted. I said to Pashinyan, make a statement, make a commitment, provide a timetable. I have been saying this since the first day of the war. Everyone can see it. In my interviews and my addresses to the nation, I spoke openly – provide a timetable, give me a schedule, get out, leave, and I will stop. They were asking us from here and there to stop. But why didn't you tell them to stop when they occupied our lands? Why didn't anyone say to Armenia, which has been occupying our land for 30 years, \"get out of there!\" What is this?\nWell, we are now relying on our strength to liberate these lands by giving martyrs and shedding blood. Why are you telling us to stop and not telling them to get out? No-one says that. They told us to stop. I said I would not stop. No-one can stop me. I said I demand from you, Pashinyan, you personally, not your foreign minister or anyone else – you must make a personal commitment, you must provide a date by which you will get out of our lands. There is that commitment in this statement. We forced him, we compelled him, and we made him commit by beating him up for all his evil deeds, for keeping those pigs in our mosques. He who keeps pigs in our mosques is a pig himself. Now there is an obligation in this document. He will get out of the rest of the occupied lands by December 1. Therefore, there is a military option. But as I said, I want this military phase to stop to move on to the political stage. What happened - exactly what I was saying? All that I was saying is coming true today. The military phase is over, and we are moving on to the political stage. We have signed a document that favors our interests the most. Pashinyan has signed it. There was no other option. In essence, this is an admission of defeat. This is a military capitulation. In principle, I could ask him to come and sit there, down below, and sign it there. But I am no such person. Why humiliate anyone? He has already humiliated himself. He put himself in this disgraceful situation. He should have thought of today when he put his stomach forward and danced in a drunken state in Jidir Duzu. This is it. No-one can joke with us. No-one can test Azerbaijani people's patience. No-one can insult us. If you do, you will learn a lesson. And we have taught him a lesson.\nTherefore, the issue has already been resolved – of course, if Armenia adheres to the ceasefire. I have already given all of my orders. I have given my orders to command centers, and we will stop. We respect our signature. The other side must also stop because if it doesn't stop, we won't stop either.\nInternational observers know who violated the ceasefire. Who violated it the first time by bombing Ganja with a ballistic missile, who violated the truce the second time less than five minutes after it was declared, and the third time by hitting Barda with cluster missiles. If they break it again, I think they will regret it even more. Therefore, we were able to achieve what we wanted. We were able to force the enemy. I gave them an ultimatum. I said – you must leave, if you don't, I will go to the end. Until the end! On November 8, I said in the Alley of Martyrs that I would go to the end, and no force could stop me.\nWe won this victory on the battlefield. About 300 settlements, including Fuzuli, Jabrayil, Zangilan, Gubadli, Shusha, Hadrut, Sugovushan and other settlements, were liberated on the battlefield.\nThese victories forced the enemy to return Aghdam, Lachin and Kalbajar districts to us through political means. But it would be wrong to look for any good intentions of the Armenian side here. They have no idea what good intentions are. They were simply forced. Because he knew that if he did not sign this document, we would get these lands ourselves anyway. Everyone knew that. I said that I do not want to shed blood. We must stop the war, so get out of our lands! And this is precisely what happened.\nI would like to mention one more issue. I have just acquainted my dear people with the text of the document. A new control mechanism is being applied here. The fifth paragraph of the statement reads: \"In order to increase the effectiveness of control over the implementation of the agreements reached by the Parties to the conflict, a peacekeeping center shall be deployed.\" I can say that Russian and Turkish servicemen will work in this center. Thus, Turkey will officially play a role in the conflict's future settlement and monitoring the ceasefire.\nIn my remarks at the signing ceremony in the videoconference format, I praised the efforts of both the President of Turkey, my dear brother Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin. They made truly great efforts during these 44-45 days to resolve the issue peacefully. At the same time, I am delighted that these two leaders have already played a positive role in ending the conflict. I think that it also largely determines the format of future cooperation in the region. If we look at the history of relations between Turkey and Russia today, I think they are at the highest level. Both countries are friendly and neighboring countries for us. So I think that this format of cooperation can be even more diverse in the future.\nAnother important issue I would like to emphasize is that a link is being established between the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic and the rest of Azerbaijan. The opening of all communications and roads also shows that new transport and communication infrastructure can and should be created. We have, of course, been very supportive. I can say that this paragraph was included in this statement upon my insistence. It has no bearing to the Armenia-Azerbaijan Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, but I am glad that my request was accepted. Thus, a historic step was taken to connect the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic with Azerbaijan, with Azerbaijan proper by land. The despised enemy besieged Nakhchivan in the early 1990s and shortly before. All communication lines were cut off. At that time, energy resources were supplied from the central part of Azerbaijan. The Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic was in a tough situation. At the same time, there were attacks from the territory of Armenia. I have said many times that it was thanks to the courage and endeavors of the great leader Heydar Aliyev that Nakhchivan was not occupied. Armenian vandals did have such plans.\nTherefore, I would like to emphasize this and congratulate the people of Nakhchivan on this occasion. I must say that Nakhchivan's people, as indeed residents from all other regions, took an active part in the second Karabakh war. Now the war is over, some issues that have not been disclosed will be revealed. Everyone will know that the people of Nakhchivan, along with servicemen from all other regions, have shown extraordinary heroism, selflessness and became martyrs for the liberation of our lands.\nI would like to touch upon one more issue. These days we saw the unity of the Azerbaijani people. Our army received support from all our regions. People across all our regions lived these days with great excitement, watched the news in front of the TV, radio, on the Internet every day, rejoiced at our successes. We saw this in all our regions. We were further convinced of how wonderful our country and our people are. Representatives of all nationalities and all religious denominations living in our country showed courage fighting the enemy and restored Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. This is our great asset, a great value. I have said this many times. Armenia is deprived of such happiness because it is a mono-ethnic state; no-one lives there except for the Armenians. In Eurasia, there is no other country like this in our region because no-one can live there. They are expelled, subjected to ethnic cleansing like the Azerbaijanis, or representatives of different nationalities cannot live there. They are being squeezed out, out, and out. But our advantage lies precisely in this. A multinational and multi-confessional Azerbaijan has asserted itself in this war; representatives of all peoples have displayed true unity and heroism. I want to say again that this war clarified many issues yet again.\nI would like to mention one more issue. You probably noticed that this statement contains not a single word about the status of Nagorno-Karabakh! Where are the demands of the Armenian side that Nagorno-Karabakh should be granted independence? When I offered them autonomy, they disagreed. They said no, it was an \"independent state\". For many years, they have been living as an \"independent state\" and must gain independence from Azerbaijan.\nNot a word, Pashinyan! What happened? What is it, Pashinyan? This phrase will probably remain the talk of the town for many years - what happened, Pashinyan? You were going to pave a road to Jabrayil. You danced. But where is the status? The status went to hell. It failed; it was shattered to smithereens. It is not and will not be there. As long as I am President, there will be no status. Therefore, this document is of great importance. I am sure that the Azerbaijani people, having shown great attention to this document, will read it in detail, with great attention, and they will see what a tremendous political victory we have achieved. Our military victory plays a unique role in achieving this political victory. Of course, the work carried out in our country in recent years, the excellent atmosphere that has developed, the unity of the people and the government, the achievement of a positive environment in political relations, our international relevance, our performance in the international arena – all this and, of course, the army building have made our victory possible. These days, I also noticed the following. Even people with different political views, those who are critical of our work and often express unfounded criticism, showed a model of high consciousness during this period. I have always said that there are and should be different views on the political plane. This is normal. There must be opposition. We, as in any democratic country, of course, have all these freedoms. Only one thing should not be there – it is impossible to be in opposition to the state and statehood. You can't live with the idea - \"the worse it is for the government, the state, the better off I am\". I can say: these days, I saw that we could all unite in national causes. It is also essential for our future because we all want Azerbaijan to develop and become an even more powerful country. We have demonstrated our strength on the battlefield, in the political sphere, in any format. We showed our independence. The day will come, and some issues will probably be revealed that could not be announced during the war. Perhaps I can also clarify some points. Then everyone will see what ordeals we had to overcome, how much pressure we came under. We can say that they repeatedly told us to stop, stop, and stop! But we went forward because I felt the support of the people. I saw their confidence in me. Nothing could stop me because I knew we were right. We are restoring our territorial integrity, returning our lands. This war showed the whole world how great the Azerbaijani people are – the unconquered people, the people with iron resolve, the victorious people, and our victorious army! We are proud of our people, our military!\nI am sure that all Azerbaijani citizens believe that these days and minutes are the happiest in their lives. I am also excited to convey good news and these messages to the Azerbaijani people. I am pleased to have signed this historic document. I am happy that we are returning to our homeland, to our native Karabakh, Shusha - Karabakh's crown jewel, and we will always live in these lands! From now on, no-one can move us from these lands!\nThe expression \"Karabakh is Azerbaijan!\" has already become a symbol of our victory. I said it a year ago. I am proud that my statement has already become a national slogan. Today we can say with great pride that Fuzuli is ours, Jabrayil is ours, Zangilan is ours, Gubadli is ours, Aghdam is ours, Lachin is ours, Kalbajar is ours, Shusha is ours, Karabakh is ours, Karabakh is Azerbaijan!

Kelly Loeffler, who will fight to retain her seat during a Georgia runoff election in January, donated large portions of her Senate salary to anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ rights organizations.\nAmong these organizations are several “crisis pregnancy centers” that often pose as abortion clinics in order to dissuade people from getting the procedure, and an adoption agency that has a strong anti-LGBTQ ethos and bans same-sex couples from using it.\nLoeffler is the wealthiest member of Congress. She and her husband hold a roughly $500 million stake in the New York Stock Exchange’s parent company, Intercontinental Exchange, Forbes reported, estimating that the couple’s net worth is at least $800 million.\nBecause of this, Loeffler pledged to donate her $174,000 congressional salary to Georgia charities each quarter. Over the last two financial quarters, she donated $26,600 to seven anti-abortion pregnancy centers, and $3,800 to Covenant Care Adoptions, an anti-LGBTQ agency.\nBuzzFeed News has journalists around the US bringing you trustworthy stories on the 2020 elections. To help keep this news free, become a member.\nCovenant Care Adoptions, a nonprofit adoption and counseling agency based in Georgia, requires that all adoptive parents be “husband and wife” who agree to the Statement of Faith listed on its website. The statement says that \"the term 'marriage' has only one meaning: the uniting of one man and one woman in a single, exclusive union,\" and that \"any form of sexual immorality (including ... homosexual behavior, bisexual conduct, bestiality, incest, and use of pornography) is sinful and offensive to God.\"\nThe statement also says, \"Rejection of one’s biological sex is a rejection of the image of God within that person,\" and it is “imperative” that anyone who works for or volunteers with Covenant Care Adoptions or who wants to adopt a child through the organization “share these beliefs.”\nLoeffler’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on her choice to donate to Covenant Care Adoptions, or whether she agrees with the organization’s anti-LGBTQ statement.\nShe has served in the Senate for less than a year, after being appointed to the seat in January, and has been an ally of President Donald Trump’s. She faced a challenge from fellow Republican Rep. Doug Collins as well as Democrat Raphael Warnock in Georgia’s all-party primary in November. Loeffler was forced into a runoff against Warnock, as neither candidate passed the necessary 50% vote threshold they needed to win the seat in November. The runoff will take place Jan. 5.\nIf you have a news tip, we’d like to hear from you. Reach out to us via one of our tip line channels.\nOf the seven crisis pregnancy centers Loeffler donated to this year, one is the Georgia branch of Obria Medical Clinics, a California-based company that has been embroiled in controversy over the past few years.\nIn 2019, Obria obtained a $5.1 million federal grant of Title X funding that would be doled out over three years, specifically intended to subsidize clinics providing birth control. Obria does not provide patients with any kind of contraception, instead recommending abstinence or the highly ineffective “rhythm method,” which recommends people only have sex while they are not ovulating in order to not conceive.\nObria’s grant was a part of the Trump administration’s attempt to redistribute Title X money to conservative, anti-abortion organizations instead of Planned Parenthood, which previously received a large portion of the grant. (The money was legally barred from being used for abortions.)\nCampaign for Accountability — a progressive watchdog group that sued Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services for information about its use of federal family planning funds — argued in 2019 that Obria is in violation of the requirements for receiving the grant. Before the Trump administration altered the grant requirements (triggering ongoing lawsuits), it included providing contraception and abortion counseling, services Obria does not provide.\nIn response, an HHS spokesperson said in a statement to Politico that it would not force Obria to comply with the contraception requirements.\nObria also says on its website that it provides “abortion pill reversal,” an unproven idea that suggests that taking a hormone called progesterone can halt the termination of a pregnancy after a pregnant person has taken the first of two pills required for a medication abortion. There is no evidence this is possible, and no clear understanding of possible side effects. Two major studies of abortion reversal were shut down for ethical and safety issues.\nObria CEO Kathleen Eaton Bravo also faced pushback from abortion rights advocates after the Guardian unearthed her 2015 interview with the Catholic World Report, in which she said that Christianity began to “die out” in Europe “when its nations accepted contraception and abortion.”\n“With Europeans having no children, immigrant Muslims came in to replace them, and now the culture of Europe is changing,” she said.\nLoeffler donated $3,800 of her Senate salary to Obria over the last two financial quarters. Obria did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nTrump will campaign for Loeffler and Republican Sen.

This is the only way to make reliable statements on the effectiveness of a vaccine against Covid-19. On the basis of the many different PCR tests of highly varying quality, neither the risk of disease nor a possible vaccine benefit can be determined with the necessary certainty, which is why testing the vaccine on humans is unethical per se.\nView the Petition Here:\nWodarg Yeadon EMA Petition Pfizer Trial FINAL 01DEC2020 en Unsigned With Exhibits\nFurthermore, they demand that it must be excluded, e.g. by means of animal experiments, that risks already known from previous studies, which partly originate from the nature of the corona viruses, can be realized. The concerns are directed in particular to the following points:\n- The formation of so-called “non-neutralizing antibodies” can lead to an exaggerated immune reaction, especially when the test person is confronted with the real, “wild” virus after vaccination. This so-called antibody-dependent amplification, ADE, has long been known from experiments with corona vaccines in cats, for example. In the course of these studies all cats that initially tolerated the vaccination well died after catching the wild virus.\n- The vaccinations are expected to produce antibodies against spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. However, spike proteins also contain syncytin-homologous proteins, which are essential for the formation of the placenta in mammals such as humans. It must be absolutely ruled out that a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 could trigger an immune reaction against syncytin-1, as otherwise infertility of indefinite duration could result in vaccinated women.\n- The mRNA vaccines from BioNTech/Pfizer contain polyethylene glycol (PEG). 70% of people develop antibodies against this substance – this means that many people can develop allergic, potentially fatal reactions to the vaccination.\n- The much too short duration of the study does not allow a realistic estimation of the late effects. As in the narcolepsy cases after the swine flu vaccination, millions of healthy people would be exposed to an unacceptable risk if an emergency approval were to be granted and the possibility of observing the late effects of the vaccination were to follow. Nevertheless, BioNTech/Pfizer apparently submitted an application for emergency approval on December 1, 2020.\nCALL FOR HELP: Dr. Wodarg and Dr. Yeadon ask as many EU citizens as possible to co-sign their petition by sending the e-mail prepared here to the EMA.\nNot part of the original article but a comment….\nAfter a little research it turns out that Syncytin-1 is also present in sperm, so it’s not only Women that will be steralised but Men as well. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261257414_Syncytin-1_and_its_receptor_is_present_in_human_gametes\nFrom:http://tapnewswire.com/2020/12/a-quick-glance-at-the-small-print-spells-danger/\n139 Comments\nIt is the same problem too with the GlaxoSmithKline vaccine.\nhttps://johnplatinumgoss.com/2020/12/02/pfizer-biontech-vaccine-the-end-of-life/\nLikeLike\nStop the vaccination programme until all side effects are determined\nLikeLike"}, {"claim": "China recovered from COVID-19 without a vaccine.", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Refuted", "justification": "It is very hard to say from these question and answer pairs.

I'll talk to Democratic senator and presidential hopeful Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana. Plus, the Democratic race. Elizabeth Warren's numbers dip sharply.\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN:\nI don't do polls. I'm out here fighting every day on behalf of working families.\nCHUCK TODD:\nPete Buttigieg is on the rise, but still facing skepticism among African American voters.\nPETE BUTTIGIEG:\nI'm very conscious of the advantages and privileges that I have had. Through the advantages that come with being white and being male.\nCHUCK TODD:\nWe'll have the latest on a Democratic field that seems no closer to sorting itself out.\nAlso, John Kerry and Arnold Schwarzenegger are founding members of a group called World War Zero, which aims to spark a nationwide conversation on the catastrophic effects of global warming. I'll speak to both Kerry and Schwarzenegger this morning. Joining me for insight and analysis are: New York Times columnist David Brooks, Maria Teresa Kumar, president of Voto Latino, Republican Strategist Al Cardenas, and Betsy Woodruff Swan of The Daily Beast. Welcome to Sunday. It's Meet the Press.\nANNOUNCER:\nFrom NBC News in Washington, the longest running show in television history, this is Meet the Press with Chuck Todd.\nCHUCK TODD:\nGood Sunday morning. I hope you’ve been enjoying your Thanksgiving weekend. With the House Judiciary Committee beginning the formal process of drawing up charges against the president, the White House faces a new deadline. Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler has given President Trump and his lawyers until 5pm on Friday to decide whether to take part at all. Mr. Trump has repeatedly called the impeachment investigation a sham, a scam, and a hoax. The Republican strategy has been to focus on the impeachment process, delegitimize it and scare newly-elected House Democrats in swing districts into voting against impeachment. Delegitimizing the process also makes it easier for many Republican senators, like John Kennedy of Louisiana perhaps, who'll join me in a moment, to vote to acquit the president in an impeachment trial. Now, Republicans are quick to point out that weeks of impeachment hearings have not increased the public's appetite for impeachment. And while that's true, it's also hard to argue that having roughly 50 percent of the voters wanting you removed from office immediately is where any president wants to be right now as well. So to use a football term, President Trump and Republicans have beaten the spread on surviving the initial political fallout of all of this. But they're a long way away from winning the game.\nREP. NANCY PELOSI:\nAs I said to the president, if you have any information that is exculpatory, please bring it forward.\nCHUCK TODD:\nWith that next hearing scheduled for Wednesday and new reporting that the president knew about a whistleblower complaint before he released aid to Ukraine, President Trump and his allies are attempting to turn up the political pressure on Democrats.\nPRES. DONALD TRUMP:\nYou see what's happening in the polls? Everybody said, that's really bullsh**.\nCHUCK TODD:\nRepublican groups have spent nearly 7 million dollars on ads against impeachment since Pelosi announced the inquiry in September - compared to just over $2.8 million on pro-impeachment ads by Democratic groups, almost entirely money spent by Tom Steyer, and mostly in support of his own campaign. Most of that money is targeting new Democratic House members in swing districts.\nVOICEOVER:\nTheir partisan impeachment is a politically motivated charade. They promised to be different, but they're not.\nCHUCK TODD:\nSo far, public opinion remains split along partisan lines. In a CNN poll, 50% of adults support impeachment, 43% do not -- numbers unchanged from a month ago. Quinnipiac has similar numbers: 45% of voters think President Trump should be impeached, 48 percent do not, also little changed from October. Just 13% of voters say they might change their minds. Still, that remains a critical slice of the electorate. And vulnerable Democrats are carefully weighing how to talk about impeachment and, likely later this month, how to vote on it.\nREP. DEAN PHILLIPS:\nI did not run for Congress to impeach the President. There’s no question.\nREP. CINDY AXNE:\nI didn’t run for this seat to impeach the president. Go back and check my 18 months of running for this office, there’s nothing in there about that.\nREP. KENDRA HORN:\nThis is not why I ran. I ran to serve.\nCHUCK TODD:\nRepublicans in toss-up Senate seats are also wary of weighing in. Protesters gathered at all six of Senator Collins' Maine offices on Tuesday.\nSEN. SUSAN COLLINS:\nAnd just as you wouldn't want a juror to go into a case prejudging it and not being familiar with all of the evidence - I feel very strongly about that.\nCHUCK TODD:\nA Senate trial could scramble the 2020 calendar, requiring the six senators running for president to return to Washington after the December holidays.\nSEN. MITCH MCCONNELL:\nWe will take it up, because we have no choice. And how long we're on it will be determined by the majority of the Senate.\nCHUCK TODD:\nAnd while 2020 Democrats support impeachment, they are not enthusiastic about campaigning on it.\nJOE BIDEN:\nThe question is not first and foremost: 'what about impeachment’?\nPETE BUTTIGIEG:\nOut here on the trail, our job is to talk to voters about how their lives are going to be impacted by who's sitting in the White House.\nANDREW YANG:\nEvery moment we’re talking about impeaching Donald Trump or Donald Trump in any context, we are not creating a positive vision for the country.\nCHUCK TODD:\nAnd joining me now is Democratic presidential candidate Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Senator Klobuchar, welcome back to Meet the Press.\nSEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR:\nThank you, Chuck. It's wonderful to be on.\nCHUCK TODD:\nAll right, the collision of impeachment, the campaign is all now upon us. In 63 days, I think, we'll be caucusing. You might be there taking a break from the Senate trial. What role does public opinion play in all this for you? I mean, we're at a stalemate. No matter what you think of the facts, we're at a public opinion stalemate here. What role should that play in this?\nSEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR:\nThe first obligation is a constitutional one. We don't have a choice. This is something where the Founding Fathers themselves, James Madison said that the reason we needed impeachment provisions is that he feared that a president would betray the trust of the American people to a foreign power. That's why this is proceeding. I see it simply as a global Watergate. Back then, you had a president in Richard Nixon who was paranoid and he delegated to some people to go break into the headquarters and get into a file cabinet to get dirt on a political opponent. That's basically what this president has done on a global basis. Yes, it's a public trial and the public will be able to see more and will be able to reach their own decisions, but in the end it's our constitutional obligation and I can do two things at once.\nCHUCK TODD:\nLet me -- I want to show you a quote from a Congress -- a member of Congress from Michigan who said this. Brenda Lawrence, Democrat, said this. \"We are so close to an election and I will tell you sitting here, knowing how divided the country is, I don't see the value of taking him out of office, but I do see the value of putting down a marker saying his behavior is not acceptable.\" That is one way to look at this public opinion, that you see that people, sort of -- people that are actually listening and everything are torn on the election as opposed to this, are split on this. You've got a Democratic member in your own state, Collin Peterson, who didn't even vote to go through this procedure. He's from a Trump district. Is that what you hear?\nSEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR:\nLet me talk about how I see this. Yes, this is a legal impeachment proceeding and it could result in him being thrown out of office. That is true. But I see this as part of a bigger pattern and the pattern is this: He betrays the trust of the American people. He puts his private interests, he puts his business interests, he puts his partisan political interests in front of our country's. That's what people get. That's why you see, for instance, the fact that he went out there and rallied for the opponents -- Republicans in Louisiana and Kentucky and the Democrats won. We have a new Democratic governor in Kentucky and that is because the people said, \"You know what? He's betrayed us on healthcare. We haven't been able to get the healthcare that we want.\"\nCHUCK TODD:\nDo you fear, though, what he could do -- how he would interpret a Senate acquittal?\nSEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR:\nI have no idea what he will do. All I know is that we have an obligation to the country to lead, to have this proceeding be conducted fairly, which I believe it has. It was all in public in the last week. People got to see people like Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, who made the American point to his dad, \"Hey, this is a country where you can tell the truth.\" I think the importance is that it's fair and that we get a result.\nCHUCK TODD:\nThe Republicans have poured millions of dollars into these swing districts trying -- with an anti-impeachment message. Democrats have not countered. And I understand why they haven't, right. They don't want to look like they're politicizing this process. And yet, what's happening? It's an asymmetrical warfare and you're losing the political argument in public opinion. Should there -- hindsight's 20/20. Are Democrats making a mistake not sticking up with paid media for these -- particularly these swing state Democrats?\nSEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR:\nI think it's way too early to tell that, Chuck. We have got a whole election season in front of us and my evidence is what just happened, where we took back the Virginia State House and State Senate right in the middle of all of this because the voters were looking at that, yes. This is a patriotism check. This is a values check. There are people that don't even want to have the -- watch the president on TV anymore. They have to turn the volume down on their TV. And it is also an economic check. So, when I went on those -- that Blue Wall tour to places like Michigan and Pennsylvania and to Wisconsin and talked to citizens who had maybe voted for him before, they said, \"Enough. He hasn't come through for us. Our prescription drug costs are skyrocketing. What has he done? He's just whining on TV all the time.\"\nCHUCK TODD:\nLet me talk about your race. It seems as if right now everybody is focused on everybody's flaws, all the reasons why none of you can unite the Democratic party, why none of you can do this, and you've got this problem, and this candidate's got that problem. It's only a focus on the warts. Is this damaging long-term?\nSEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR:\nWe will come together. You know, we are not like the Republican party, where they say, \"He says jump and they say, 'How high?'\" and no one says, \"The emperor has no clothes.\" Our party is going to have a debate about issues, but I am the candidate from the very beginning that said we have to cross the river of our divides when I announced on that river in the middle of that blizzard. I am the candidate that said, \"I don't want to be the president for half of America, but all of America.\" And I have set a very clear path that we will have divides, but I am where the people are. And that means that I have big, bold ideas. No one has a monopoly on good ideas, but I am the one that will unite this party.\nCHUCK TODD:\nWhat's the criticism of your campaign so far that's resonated the most with you? That you think, \"You know what? That's fair. I'm trying to change\"?\nSEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR:\nWell, I think it would always be nice to get in more money, and we have. You know, they're always saying, \"Oh, you haven't raised as much money as some of these other guys.\" Well, I'm not as well known. Since the last debate, we've taken over $2 million in at one instance, online, from regular people, in six days. So, we are expanding. We're opening more offices in Iowa. We're more -- opening more offices and adding staff in New Hampshire and in the other early states. And that's because the momentum's on our side. And I'm never going to be able to compete with two billionaires. That is true. I'm not going to be able to buy this $30 some million ad buy.\nCHUCK TODD:\nYou seem particularly insulted by Bloomberg's entry. No I mean, and I look, I understand if other -- but look he’s -- this is your space. You're saying, \"Hey, I'm the compromise. I'm the one that if Biden falters, and all of a sudden, hey, you, you're getting into my space.\" That's what you sounded like.\nSEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR:\nWell, it is more about money in politics for me. I have admiration for the work that he's done, but I don't buy this argument that you get in because you say, \"Oh, everyone else sucks.\" I just don't. I think we have strong candidates. I don't think that any of the polling or the numbers show that people are dissatisfied with all their candidates. They're just trying to pick the right one. So, my case is to make that it's me. I'm the one from the beginning that has set that path that you look people in the eyes, you tell them the truth, that no, we're not going to give free college to everyone, but we're going to match our economy with the jobs and the education system that we have. I'm the one that is the only one on the stage that didn't get on that bill for kicking people off their current health insurance in four years.\nCHUCK TODD:\nMichael Bloomberg, if he doesn’t qualify -- if you don't ever get to debate him, but he ends up winning a nomination --\nSEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR:\nThat can't happen.\nCHUCK TODD:\nAre the rules --\nSEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR:\nI mean, he's got to debate people and he also has to get out there. You know, I didn't see him out there in the middle of that snowstorm three days ago in Iowa. I was out there and people turned out. People turned out in big numbers wherever we went. And that's because, that’s why we have early states, so that people are able to meet the candidates and they're able to make a good decision. It cannot be all about money or rich people would be running and winning in every Senate race in the country. That's not what happens.\nCHUCK TODD:\nBack quickly to impeachment. Any chance you would vote to acquit?\nSEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR:\nI can't see that happening right now, but I am someone that looks at each count and makes a decision. I've said from the beginning, I see this as impeachable conduct.\nCHUCK TODD:\nSenator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat from Minnesota, sorry about the University of Minnesota yesterday. It’s been a great season. It's been a good season.\nSEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR:\nOkay that’s true. The Rose Bowl was in our reach.\nCHUCK TODD:\nIt's been a good season.\nSEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR:\nWe will see. We will see.\nCHUCK TODD:\nIt's still a heck of a season. Row the boat.\nSEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR:\nOkay, thank you.\nCHUCK TODD:\nThanks for being on. Stay safe on the trail.\nCHUCK TODD:\nAnd joining me now is Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana, who also happens to sit on the Judiciary Committee in the Senate side of things. Senator Kennedy, welcome back to Meet the Press.\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nThank you, Chuck.\nCHUCK TODD:\nYou appeared on a show last Sunday and you walked back a comment that you made there. Can you explain what you misstated and what you, what you wanted to fix? What part of the record you wanted to correct?\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nSure. I walked it back because I was wrong.\nCHUCK TODD:\nAbout what?\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nChris Wallace was interviewing me. I'm sorry?\nCHUCK TODD:\nAbout what? What were you wrong about?\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nWell, Chris Wallace was interviewing me and he asked me a question and I answered it. I thought he had asked me if Ukraine had meddled in the 2016 election. He didn't. He asked me if Ukraine was responsible for hacking the DNC computer, which is of course a form of meddling. I went back and looked at the transcript and I realized Chris was right and I was wrong, so I said I was wrong.\nCHUCK TODD:\nThe issue of conflating what Ukraine did and what Russia did has been, I think, at the heart of some of the criticism you've received. Michael Gerson, who's no liberal columnist in the Washington Post, certainly not a fan of President Trump either, I'll grant you that.\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nUh-huh.\nCHUCK TODD:\nBut here's what he wrote about your appearance. He said this: \"Politicians such as Kennedy must know the truth about Russia aggression, but still they choose to suck up to the president by reflecting his mania and sharing his blind spots. Loyalty to Trump among Republicans is proved by the loosening of all other loyalties, to truth, to honesty, and to the national good. By this measure, Kennedy is profoundly loyal to the president.\" Simply uttering this conflation on Ukraine and Russia, the inference is you're doing the president's dirty work here. Do you accept that criticism?\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nWell, listen, I like Michael Gerson. I haven't met him, but I know he's a smart guy and I read his columns now and again. I disagree with him. I think both Russia and Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election. I think it's been well documented in the Financial Times, in Politico, in The Economist, in the Washington Examiner, even on CBS, that the prime minister of Ukraine, the interior minister, the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, the head of the Ukrainian Anti-Corruption League, all meddled in the election on social media and otherwise. They worked with a DNC operative --\nCHUCK TODD:\nDid you -- all right, let me --\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\n-- against the president. In fact, can I make one more point, Chuck?\nCHUCK TODD:\nSure.\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nCan I make one more point?\nCHUCK TODD:\nYeah.\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nIn fact, in December of 2018, a Ukrainian court ruled that Ukrainian officials had violated Ukrainian law by, by meddling in our election. And that was reported in the New York Times.\nCHUCK TODD:\nWere you, were you --\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nNow, is there, is there meddling -- I'm sorry.\nCHUCK TODD:\nNo, no, no, were you briefed --\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nGo ahead.\nCHUCK TODD:\n-- by the intelligence -- according to the New York Times a couple of weeks ago, U.S. senators were briefed after Fiona Hill's testimony that actually this entire effort to frame Ukraine for the Russian meddling of 2016, of which you, you just made this case that they've done it, that actually this is an effort of Russia propaganda, that this is a Russian intelligence propaganda campaign in order to get people like you to say these things about Ukraine.\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nUh-huh.\nCHUCK TODD:\nThey're trying to frame Ukraine. You apparently were briefed about this in the United States Senate by intelligence officials. Are you at all concerned you're doing Russian intelligence work here?\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nI was not briefed.\nCHUCK TODD:\nYou didn't attend that briefing?\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nAnd now, listen, doctor --\nCHUCK TODD:\nYou didn't attend a briefing on that?\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nNo. And doctor --\nCHUCK TODD:\nOkay.\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nI wasn't briefed. Dr. Hill is entitled to her opinion. But when The Economist magazine --\nCHUCK TODD:\nWhen does opinion, when does opinion become fact? Does 17 intelligence services saying it, does every western intelligence ally saying Russia did this? I'm just sort of confused, at what point is it no longer an opinion for you?\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nI don't think it's an opinion. I think it's a fact. I believe the reporting by the Politico magazine.\nCHUCK TODD:\nYou just said Fiona Hill --\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nI believe the reporting by The Economist.\nCHUCK TODD:\nYou just said Fiona Hill gave an opinion.\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nI believe the report -- I believe the reporting by The Financial Times. I believe the reporting by the Washington Examiner. You should read the articles, Chuck. They're very well documented. And I believe that a Ukrainian district court, in December of 2018, slapped down several Ukrainian officials for meddling in our election as a violation of Ukrainian law. Now, I didn't report those facts. Reputable journalists reported those facts. Does that mean that Ukrainian, the Ukrainian leaders were more aggressive than Russia? No. Russia was very aggressive and they're much more sophisticated. But the fact that Russia was so aggressive does not exclude the fact that President Poroshenko actively worked for Secretary Clinton. Now, if I'm wrong and if all of these journalists --\nCHUCK TODD:\nActively worked for Secretary --\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\n-- are wrong --\nCHUCK TODD:\nI mean, my goodness, wait a minute, Senator Kennedy, you now have the president of Ukraine saying he actively worked for the Democratic nominee for president. I mean, now come on. I mean, I got to put up -- you realize the only other person selling this argument outside the United States is this man, Vladimir Putin. This is what he said on November 20th: \"Thank God nobody is accusing us anymore of interfering in U.S. elections. Now they're accusing Ukraine. Well, let them sort this out among themselves.\" You just accused a former president of Ukraine. You have done exactly what the Russian operation is trying to get American politicians to do. Are you at all concerned that you've been duped?\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nNo, because you -- just read the articles. Do you believe The Economist magazine is a reputable journal? It's been around, I think, since 1843. They pretty much --\nCHUCK TODD:\nDo you think there's a difference in criticizing --\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nThey're not liberal or conservative.\nCHUCK TODD:\nDo you think there's a difference in a country criticizing a presidential candidate who essentially endorsed another country's invasion and annexation of a part of their country as equivalent to what Russia did with the DNC?\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nWell, let me put it this way, Chuck. Let's suppose, and I don't, I don’t believe it, but you're right and I'm wrong. Then what harm would it do to allow the president of the United States, who has a demonstrated record fighting foreign corruption, to introduce evidence?\nCHUCK TODD:\nWhy doesn't he?\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nWhat harm would it do?\nCHUCK TODD:\nHe has been, he has been provided every opportunity to provide exculpatory evidence on any of this and they have chosen not to.\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nNo, he hasn't. No, he hasn't.\nCHUCK TODD:\nYes, he has.\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nRounds one and two by Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Schiff are as rigged as a carnival ring toss, and we both know that. If I were a prosecutor and I were prosecuting you for a felony, and I went to a federal judge and I said, \"Judge, we both know Chuck's guilty. So, let me call witnesses. Give me an order that he can't call any witnesses. He can't cross-examine my witnesses. He can't offer any rebuttal evidence. His lawyer can't even be there,\" you know what that federal judge would do?\nCHUCK TODD:\nBut that wasn't the trial.\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nHe'd either put me in handcuffs --\nCHUCK TODD:\nYou're going to get a trial.\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\n-- or he'd put me in a straightjacket, because I'd be sanctioned.\nCHUCK TODD:\nDo you think this White House --\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nAnd that's what happened here.\nCHUCK TODD:\nBut Senator, this White House has not, has not cooperated on any oversight at all. Have they not brought some of this upon themselves?\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nHave they allowed the president to call his own witnesses? No. Have they allowed him to have his lawyer present? No. Have they allowed him to offer rebuttal evidence? No. Have they allowed him to cross-examine the witnesses that were hand-picked by Speaker Pelosi? No. Now, whether you like the president or you don't, we both, I know, agree with due process. Nobody is above the law, Chuck, but nobody's beneath the law. And the Bill of Rights is not an à la carte menu. It's not.\nCHUCK TODD:\nWe will leave it there. Senator Kennedy, Republican from Louisiana. You guys didn't get tripped up this weekend, so LSU's clear sailing for next week. But don't blow it. Don't blow it and mess up the whole playoff --\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nWe won't.\nCHUCK TODD:\n-- system there. Thanks for coming on and sharing your view, sir.\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nThank you, Chuck.\nCHUCK TODD:\nI appreciate it.\nSEN. JOHN KENNEDY:\nGood to see you, my friend.\nCHUCK TODD:\nWhen we come back, Republicans insist they're winning the political fight over impeachment. Are they right? The panel is next.\nCHUCK TODD:\nWelcome back. Panel is here. Republican strategist Al Cardenas; Maria Teresa Kumar, president of Voto Latino; Betsy Woodruff Swan of The Daily Beast; and New York Times columnist David Brooks. Well, David, we just got an example here. We look at the -- we're having an asymmetrical argument. Democrats are trying to have a conversation about what the president did. And Republicans are having a completely different conversation. As -- we couldn't even agree on the same set of facts.\nDAVID BROOKS:\nYeah, I sort of think the Democrats should either fold this up or go big. And folding this up would mean, we’re going to have -- \"We'll impeach him. We'll send it to the Senate. We'll try to get it done as quickly as possible. And then we'll go off to the presidential campaign.\"\nCHUCK TODD:\nRight.\nDAVID BROOKS:\nGoing big would be saying, \"This is not a trial. This is a political process. The jury is in four states in the Midwest. We're going to get local people from those four states, to try to explain to the people in those four states, why this matters to them, and try to shift the poll numbers.\" So those are the two options. I think they should fold it up. Because I think political opinion is completely unmovable on this. And they should go on and have a presidential campaign.\nCHUCK TODD:\nYou know, Betsy, it is -- this is not a split decision, organically. The Republicans spent millions to get this split decision.\nBETSY WOODRUFF SWAN:\nAnd House Democratic leadership is cognizant of the fact, based on a conversation with a leadership aide I had yesterday, that they don't expect getting more than the mid-50s, in terms of support for impeachment. They see this as sort of permanently bifurcated and not as an issue where they can break that 60% number. From talking with a handful of Democratic Hill aides yesterday about this particular topic, one thing I heard multiple times is that a big concern for those vulnerable, front-line Democratic freshmen is not so much that they'll be sort of tarred with having supported impeachment, but that the argument against them will be that the only supported impeachment, and they didn't get other things done, all the way across the line.\nMARIA TERESA KUMAR:\nThat's exactly right.\nCHUCK TODD:\nWell, this is what makes Pelosi getting NAFTA 2.0, I have heard it wasn't the deal, but it was sort of implied. \"Look, I'll get this done. Don't worry.\"\nMARIA TERESA KUMAR:\nRight. Well, and this is exactly right. They need to be able to demonstrate that their whole business and their whole charge is not being consumed specifically because of impeachment. But they are also doing the people's business. But I think that Amy Klobuchar also laid it out.\nThe country needs to have a massive civic-engagement conversation right now, education in those swing states, and explaining to people, why do they actually have to do the impeachment? Because it is done -- it is basically designated to them by the Constitution.\nAnd in explaining that, you're also saying, you do not want to set precedent. If it is this president that gets away with this, the next president could be a Democrat that could do the same thing. So they have to continue down this road. But they have to be able to demonstrate that they're doing the people's business at the same time.\nCHUCK TODD:\nAl, while I see that paralysis is a successful short-term strategy for the Republicans, it's not like his numbers are getting better in the big picture.\nAL CARDENAS:\nYeah, but --\nCHUCK TODD:\nLike, he's still underwater. This has been a terrible reelection campaign effort.\nAL CARDENAS:\nTrue. But his numbers haven't gotten worse, like with Richard Nixon's, for example. I think timing's having a lot to do with this. And happy belated Thanksgiving. Look, between Thanksgiving and Christmas, I know I, for a fact, don't want to get angry at people.\nI don't want to be angry. Impeachment, for Democrats to move --\nCHUCK TODD:\nInteresting way to put it.\nAL CARDENAS:\n-- the impeachment needle, they've got to get people angrier than they are today, especially in the center in America. That's not happening. I also see evolution. You know, we don't see right and wrong the same way we did in the '70s, during Richard Nixon. America has evolved in its right-or-wrong philosophy. Look, I think what President Trump is ostensibly being accused of is more serious than what Richard Nixon was accused of. But Richard Nixon's numbers tumbled to the point where he couldn't sustain the presidency. And so he quit. And you know, I don't see the Democrats gaining from this, unless, somehow, some way, they are able to move the political needle, as well as a few Republican votes.\nCHUCK TODD:\nDavid, you said something about going big. And Al just reminded me of something. You know something big that happened this week is that somebody with conviction said, \"I'm not sticking by this president anymore. I'm going to resign and explain why I did it.\" The former Navy,\nnow-former Navy Secretary, Richard Spencer, over the president's involvement in this Navy SEAL war-crimes case, \"This was shocking and unprecedented,\" Richard Spencer wrote, \"intervention in a low-level review. It was also a reminder that the president has very little understanding of what it means to be in the military, to fight ethically, or to be governed by a uniform set of rules and practices.\" Sometimes, I wonder, when you say the \"go big\" comment, there's all this other stuff that Democrats are almost ignoring that is alarming.\nDAVID BROOKS:\nAnd here's a case where the military people I know were deeply offended by what Trump did for two reasons. One, he said, \"Oh, you've got to remember, these people are all broken people that came back from combat.\" And they're like, \"I came back from combat. I dealt with some stuff. I'm not a broken human being.\" And second, that they believe that you can fight ethically, that you can be a good soldier, Marine, whatever. And you can do it with a high standard of moral decency. And Trump sometimes seems like somebody who has no moral sense, like moral rules and things just don't seem to impress him.\nCHUCK TODD:\nHe's amoral, not immoral. It's more amoral than immoral, yeah.\nDAVID BROOKS:\nAnd so when somebody says, \"Oh, that's wrong,\" it's like telling a colorblind person, \"This is purple.\" Like, I think he's just perpetually surprised, because he doesn't have any awareness of this. And so this was a case where people in the military that I knew, Trump voters, were deeply, deeply offended.\nCHUCK TODD:\nThis is the type of story, Betsy, that actually could penetrate. You know what I mean? This is sometimes where I wonder. It's like, this was deeply offensive in a non-ideological way.\nBETSY WOODRUFF SWAN:\nAnd that's a challenge for Democrats, is that it's very difficult, from sort of a messaging perspective, to launch this challenging impeachment process and also to be able focus on these other issues. The story of the secretary of the Navy being ousted or resigning has been totally covered up, I mean, or pushed to the side by the impeachment story.\nCHUCK TODD:\nYeah, Thanksgiving, too.\nBETSY WOODRUFF SWAN:\nThe impeachment story -- xactly. But the impeachment story is dominating the way Democrats talk about the president. And it's not without an opportunity cost.\nMARIA TERESA KUMAR:\nWell, and I think this is where the president he understands this idea of letting a convicted war-crimes criminal go free but holding him really close. He is talking very closely with Eric (sic) Gallagher. He is on all the Sunday news shows, when it comes to Fox.\nCHUCK TODD:\nHe wants him to campaign.\nMARIA TERESA KUMAR:\nHe wants him to campaign. Because he wants to show that he does have his stripes. And this is where the Democrats asymmetrically don't understand the value of having a conversation of, like, when the commander in chief loses the trust of his top rank, something else is amiss.\nAL CARDENAS:\nWell, this commander in chief, to put it even in worse perspective, believes that everyone from that region is guilty of terrorism, unless proven innocent. And for him, unlike most of us, somebody shooting some -- an innocent civilian in the Middle East is not a big deal.\nHe believes, A, \"Those are bad people. We're in a fight. These casualties are, you know, casualties of war. This man is a Navy SEAL. Navy SEALs are heroes. I'm going to pardon him.\" That's the kind of messing with the right and wrong aspect of why our military's so successful. And that's basically, I think, our president's thinking.\nCHUCK TODD:\nSomebody who thinks that, by watching the military channel, they're suddenly a commander. Yes. Anyway, when we come back John Kerry and Arnold Schwarzenegger on their new effort to combat global warming.\nCHUCK TODD:\nWelcome back. The 2019 U.N. Climate Change Conference begins tomorrow in Madrid, amid sobering new studies on the effects and acceleration of global warming. In one study, the old projections of flooding and high tide by the year 2050; in this case, in Southern Vietnam, we're updated to look more like this. And not -- there's a lot more water there than Southern Vietnam, with virtually the entire area underwater now by 2050. Here in the U.S., an organization of scientists, politicians and, yes, celebrities called World War Zero hopes to spark millions of conversations about global warming in the next year and create more urgency on the issue. Joining me now from Los Angeles are two founding members: Former senator and Secretary of State, Democrat John Kerry, who created the group, and former California governor, sometime Republican, Arnold Schwarzenegger. I say sometime. I'll let you, governor, tell me these days where you are with the party. But, gentlemen, welcome back to Meet the Press. Secretary Kerry, let me start with this question. I'm going to be a bit of a cynic here. But you go out of your way to say you're not backing a single climate plan with World War Zero. This is about creating more attention to the issue. Is attention, is attention to the issue really the issue right now? This feels like a ten-year-ago problem. The issue right now is convincing a certain president of the United States to act.\nJOHN KERRY:\nWell, it's not just the president, Chuck. There are great efforts out there; many environmental groups, young people, particularly, but no country is getting the job done. I mean, the simple reality is that we are way behind, way behind the eight ball. Things are getting worse, not better. And so, what we have are unlikely allies coming together here. There's no group that has people as diverse as ours, in terms of nationality, age, gender, ideology, background, life experience. And all of these people have come together saying we've got to treat this like a war. I mean, it has to require decision-making and organization and efforts that are just not taking place. And so, we have people across ideologies. I mean, you have, you have former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson. You have former Governor of Ohio, John Kasich. You have Arnold. You have a lot of people on the other side of the aisle who've all come together without saying this is the only way to get there, but with the desire to make certain that in America and around the world, people are going to put this issue way up at the top of the list. We're going to do the things we need to do. We're going to organize. We're going to mobilize. We're going to talk to literally millions of Americans over the course of the next months and this is going to become a primary issue.\nCHUCK TODD:\nGovernor Schwarzenegger, I mean, but what does more to, what does more to, sort of, focus people's attention to this issue? A town hall or the fact that -- you know, look at your state. I mean, the wildfires are worse. And there's probably nothing right now you can do about it.\nARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER:\nWell, we are very happy and very proud of what we have done here in California, and I think we are perfect proof that you can protect the environment and also protect the economy at the same time. Because we have the strictest environmental laws here in California, and at the same time, we are number one, economically. Way ahead of the United States. Our average growth is around 3.6%, where the United States growth is around 2%. And you know, we create more jobs; millions of jobs, since we have passed those laws. So, you can see that we can do both. We are the fifth-largest economy in the world, right behind China, Germany, and Japan and the United States. So, it just shows you the power that we have by going green, and the kind of jobs we create. And I think that's what we want to do. We want the whole United States going that direction, the whole world to go in that direction. And I'm very, very happy that I've joined up here with John, because John has been a longtime friend of mine. And I've always admired his passion about a clean environment and about, you know, bringing both parties together. I mean, he negotiated with Lindsey Graham for years, a great, great deal that was almost about to happen. And so, I think that we're working together on this and I think that it is a great idea to bring Republicans and Democrats together. And of course, I am a fanatic about communication, which is a whole other issue.\nCHUCK TODD:\nAlright so --\nJOHN KERRY:\nChuck, could I just --\nCHUCK TODD:\nSecretary tell me, -- so for instance, walk me through what a town hall's going to look like in, in West Virginia, when you're in coal country.\nJOHN KERRY:\nWell, I really look forward to that, actually, because there are just huge economic opportunities for West Virginia that are not being utilized. There is -- the fact is --\nCHUCK TODD:\nWhat if the people don't want it? Hasn’t that been the problem? Like that’s been --\nJOHN KERRY:\nWell, I think you have to give people a choice, Chuck. They're not even being given a choice right now. I mean, you said, \"Are we going to back one plan?\" The answer is yes. There is one plan and that plan is to get to net zero emissions by 2045 or 2050. Now, how we get there? There are a lot of different ideas out there. But the important thing is that that's not happening now. I mean, it's embarrassing that in the Democratic presidential debates, you had a whole bunch of debates in which there wasn't one question on climate change. And climate change is -- I mean, we have a lot of young activists --\nCHUCK TODD:\nIt's a bit overwhelming, secretary. I mean, look, we -- the debate I participated in, we asked quite a bit on climate change. But it's hard to bite off. And I think that's part of the struggle here --\nJOHN KERRY:\nWell, it's not --\nCHUCK TODD:\n-- is that it's so overwhelming, how do you tackle it one piece at a time?\nJOHN KERRY:\nIn fact, Chuck, it's not. It shouldn't be overwhelming. And that's why Arnold and I, and a whole bunch of people -- you know, there's a young woman who's taken two years off from going to Stanford. Her name is Katie Eder and she's been part of the climate strikes and the Future Coalition. And she said collaboration is the key to our survival. Young people get it. They understand what this is about. But they don't have a vote in the boardroom. They don't have a vote in Congress. They don't have stock in the fossil fuel companies. And the fact is that there are a huge number of jobs to be created here. Fastest growing job in America today is solar power technician. Second fastest? Wind technician. I mean, coal is going down because the marketplace is making that decision. So, what we want to do is say to people, here are the ways in which -- take health. Health can be so much improved in the United States. Young people are hospitalized in the United States and it's costing taxpayers $55 billion a year, because of environmentally induced asthma that comes from pollution. So, we're talking about reducing pollution. We're talking about creating jobs. We're talking about American security. One of the people who's joined us in this effort is General Stan McChrystal. I mean, there's no greater patriot, nobody who's paid his dues more. We have admirals and generals who are all coming to the table to help make the argument to Americans and to people in the world, this is an international security issue.\nCHUCK TODD:\nGovernor, you're letting --\nARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER:\nI totally agree, by the way, with John --\nCHUCK TODD:\nLet me ask --\nARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER:\nI just want to tell you that, for instance, in California, in Bakersfield, where there's a lot of oil drilling going on, there's more solar jobs now in Bakersfield and around that area than there are oil jobs. People are leaving the oil fields and they're going to work in solar and clean energy and stuff like that. So, this is the kind of stuff --\nCHUCK TODD:\nDo you --\nARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER:\n-- with coal workers. So, it's just a matter of how do you plan those things. We in California have made a great plan and we see people now leaving the dirty fuels and coming to clean energy.\nCHUCK TODD:\nGovernor, do you --\nARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER:\nAnd, Chuck, I want you to come to that -- I want you to come to that town hall in West Virginia --\nCHUCK TODD:\nI would love to come to that town hall. Governor --\nARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER:\nOh yeah, we would love to have you there.\nCHUCK TODD:\n-- do you ignore President Trump or do you still try to convince him to change his mind? And would you have that one-on-one meeting?\nARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER:\nNo. No. First of all, I totally agree, again, with John when he said, you know, it's not just one person. We have to convince the whole world. And I think the way to convince the whole world is by not just always talking about climate change, which doesn't mean that much to most of the people. As a matter of fact, we have done the polls through The Schwarzenegger Institute, and you and I have talked about that. When we said, \"Climate change,\" there was like -- of the conservatives, there were only 17% interested and thought that there was a serious threat. But as soon as we said pollution, the numbers went over 50%. So, we got to communicate. The environmental community has to communicate better and talk about pollution, because pollution is a threat right now. And when you introduced this piece, you talked about, in 2050. People can't think about 2050. They think about now. How can I survive? How can I provide jobs? How can I go and feed my family? Those are the kind of issues and that's why it's important that we talk about the health issue. And that's how we have passed all of our strict environmental laws here in California --\nJOHN KERRY:\nChuck, could I mention one thing one time --\nCHUCK TODD:\nSecretary, I am way out of time.\nJOHN KERRY:\nOkay.\nCHUCK TODD:\nYou guys were great. I appreciate it. More importantly, I appreciate you got up early on the West Coast. I'm well aware of that on this weekend. So, Secretary Kerry, Governor Schwarzenegger, you talked enough where you got out of two political questions I was going to sneak on you. So, we'll leave that there. When we come back -- thank you, guys. When we come back, a change of pace. Still yearning for that Jeb coffee mug or Bernie chia pet? Fear not. The 2020 campaign elves have been hard at work and are ready for you to click buy. That's next.\nCHUCK TODD:\nWelcome back, Data Download time. Black Friday has come and gone.

In fact, the Trump and Warren campaign websites both have more than ten pages of merch for sale and both even held Black Friday sales this week. We are not making this up. Consider this a gentle reminder. There are only 24 shopping days until Christmas and only 337 until Election Day. When we come back, End Game and the Democratic race. Whatever happened to the frontrunners, particularly one named Elizabeth Warren?\nCHUCK TODD:\nBack now with Endgame. Probably the best way to describe the uncertainty of the Democratic field, let me just put up headlines from this week. Because I think it helps explain the uncertainty. New York Times had, \"How Kamala Harris' Campaign Unraveled.\" It was very much written in the past tense. \"Bloomberg is crushing all other 2020 Democrats with his ad spending in Super Tuesday states.\" You heard Amy Klobuchar talk about that. \"Warren nosedives in new nationwide poll.\" Quinnipiac, who had probably over-polled her, now had her dropping dramatically. Buttigieg leading in both Iowa and New Hampshire. Maria Teresa, who's the frontrunner in the Democratic primary right now? Is there one?\nMARIA TERESA KUMAR:\nSo well, I think it's interesting, right? So Joe Biden has the -- is still leading the polls, nationwide, because he has the highest name recognition. But when you look at Iowa, where people are doing the work, they've rolled up the sleeves, Mayor Pete, he's leading. And I think, as individuals start getting to know the candidates on the ground, that's who we should be looking at. Who is the one that's actually finding that voter that is encouraging them to move forward? Otherwise, you could say it sounds like it's a dead heat. But it's not. It's more, where are they spending most of their time? And who's gravitating towards them?\nCHUCK TODD:\nWell, it feels like the candidates are treating Pete as the frontrunner now. Here's a Cory Booker super ad--Super PAC ad that I think actually gets at, to a larger issue. Take a look.\n[BEGIN TAPE]\nVOICEOVER:\nHe's a Rhodes scholar, a successful mayor, a uniter. No, not that guy. It's Cory Booker.\n[END TAPE]\nCHUCK TODD:\nBetsy, look, the Cory Booker conundrum, and everybody’s trying to -- why doesn't he catch on, and I think people will be writing about that for a while, but to me, this is -- Buttigieg is about to get his time in the barrel, like Elizabeth Warren. She didn't hold up very well. How's he going to do?\nBETSY WOODRUFF SWAN:\nShe had a tough time. And part of the reason that she had trouble, I think, could indicate that Buttigieg may not go through the same experience. I talked to one Democratic operative last night, who said, part of the explanation for her problems, over the last month, has been that when she changed her stance on healthcare issues, she got the worst of both worlds because she frustrated progressives. She alienated some of her base, but she doesn't have nearly the credibility that she would need to try to persuade moderates that she isn't sort of, at her core, a candidate of the left. Buttigieg, however, has a moment, right now, where he can decide. Is he going to try to change some of his core policy stances? Is he going to try to move the flag that he's planted in an effort to expand his support? And if he does, he could go through the same thing that Warren just went through.\nCHUCK TODD:\nDavid Brooks, though, this African American issue, for Pete Buttigieg, seems problematic. I want to at least put up the headline. \"Pete Buttigieg Is a Lying MF.\" This is with Michael Harriot of The Root. \"It proves men like him are more willing to perpetuate the fantastic narrative of negro neighborhoods needing more role models and briefcase-carriers than make the people in power stare into the sun and see the blinding light of racism. Pete Buttigieg doesn't want to change anything. He just wants to be something.\" Now, Buttigieg did what you'd expect him to do. He called up the writer and, and because that's one way to deal with this. And, and here's how the writer responded, on Tuesday. \"The only thing I actually know about Pete Buttigieg is that he is a white man. But Pete Buttigieg listened, which is all you can ask a white man to do.\" Can Pete get through this moment?\nDAVID BROOKS:\nYeah, I think so. One of the questions I've started asking is, like, who's the Jimmy Carter here? Because we're in a moment where we need a moral rinse. And so, in '76 that was Jimmy Carter, a completely unlikely presidential candidate running against a lot of qualified senators. And he just seemed like a moral rinse. And he seemed relaxing. I think one of the reasons Warren has suffered is, a president -- a Warren presidency seems kind of exhausting, you have four more years of battle. And I think Buttigieg seems little -- is less the fighter, more, \"Oh, I can have a normal life again.\" And so normalcy is a good trait.\nCHUCK TODD:\nAl, what do you make of him? You fear him?\nAL CARDENAS:\nYeah, listen. One thing that's been surprising to me is how wide the lane on the center is in this presidential primary. If you add Biden and Mayor Pete, and if you add Amy Klobuchar, you know, you're getting a pretty big chunk of the Democrat Party at a time when the advertising's been that it's only people far to the left can hold up the anchor of the base. I don't know if it's too early to talk about a brokered convention.\nMARIA TERESA KUMAR:\nIt's too early.\nAL CARDENAS:\nYou know, well, if I was, you know, Mayor Bloomberg, I would think, you know, and he's a deep thinker, well, he's putting all his stakes on that Super Tuesday. And I think he's either going to be a one-day candidate Super Tuesday, or he's going to make sure that the vote, the delegate spread is such that he can make a good argument at the convention.\nCHUCK TODD:\nMaria Teresa, assess Pete Buttigieg. Is he a nominee that is, through all this code, attack on him. He can't put the Obama coalition together. It was subtle code attacks. You know this coalition. Can he put it together?\nMARIA TERESA KUMAR:\nWell, I think that's the challenge is that, right now, he's doing quite well in states that don't reflect the majority of the voters that was this coalition of Obama voters. And I'm talking about disproportionately Latino, African American, and young people. And I was talking to someone within his camp and I asked, I said, \"How is he polling with young people?\" Because figured that would be an indication. He's like, \"Not well.\" So --\nCHUCK TODD:\nI know he's the millennial candidate that has no millennial support.\nMARIA TERESA KUMAR:\nRight, has no millennial support. So and that says volumes, that this race is long. We still have time. But he's going to have to figure out how to appeal outside of Iowan voters to make sure that he actually has something stronger.\nCHUCK TODD:\nJust remember about older voters. They vote. They always show up for the caucuses.\nMARIA TERESA KUMAR:\nBut young voters have been voting, last year.\nCHUCK TODD:\nI know. Will they show up in the primaries? That's all for today. Thank you for watching. This was no leftover Sunday, was it? We'll be back next week. Because if it's Sunday, it's Meet the Press. It's turkey chili time tonight, though, last day of turkey.

Emerging evidence also suggests that flavanol-rich diets protect against cognitive aging, but mechanisms remain elusive. In a randomized double-blind within-subject acute study in healthy young adults, we link these two lines of research by showing, for the first time, that flavanol intake leads to faster and greater brain oxygenation responses to hypercapnia, as well as higher performance only when cognitive demand is high. Individual difference analyses further show that participants who benefit from flavanols intake during hypercapnia are also those who do so in the cognitive challenge. These data support the hypothesis that similar vascular mechanisms underlie both the peripheral and cerebral effects of flavanols. They further show the importance of studies combining physiological and graded cognitive challenges in young adults to investigate the actions of dietary flavanols on brain function.\nIntroduction\nLifespan wear and tear of the vascular system due to poor nutrition and lack of fitness, among other factors, can accelerate cognitive aging and lead to dementia. There is epidemiological evidence suggesting that flavonoids, a group of small molecules present in fruits and vegetables, can protect against vascular disease and cardiovascular-related mortality1,2,3,4. In particular, cocoa flavanols, a sub-group of flavonoids (also present in berries, grapes, apples and tea) have been shown to improve endothelial function in humans quite rapidly (within 1–2 h) by enhancing vasodilatory properties of peripheral arteries5,6. Acute benefits translate effectively into short-term (2–8 weeks) clinically relevant improvements in blood pressure and endothelial function (as measured by brachial flow-mediated dilatation, FMD)7,8, comparable to those of drugs, such as statins9,10. Mechanistically, the beneficial effects of cocoa flavanols on endothelial function have been linked to increases in bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO)6, which is known to be affected in the earliest stages of vascular disease11.Whilst the acute effects of flavanols have been mainly attributed to phase I/II-derived (−)-epicatechin metabolites, the short to long term benefits may be also driven by gut-derived metabolites12,13, although this remains to be established. Another emerging line of research further suggests that this class of plant-derived compounds may protect against cognitive decline in aging14,15,16 and cognitive resilience to neuropsychiatric disorders and stress17,18. Yet, the extent to which increases in circulatory levels of NO by flavanols can translate into benefits in the brain vasculature, and effectively influence cognitive performance in humans, is poorly understood.\nCerebral blood flow is controlled by neuronal activity but also by levels of arterial blood gases, in particular carbon dioxide (CO2)19. Relevant to our hypothesis is the fact that NO is known to contribute to CO2-dependent increases in cerebral blood flow in humans (hypercapnia)20. Furthermore, cerebrovascular reactivity to CO2 is widely accepted as a key biomarker of cerebrovascular health, and has been closely associated with cognitive function in health and disease states21,22,23,24,25. Hence, hypercapnia represents a robust model to test whether flavanol-mediated increases in endothelial function (as assessed by gold-standard FMD) mediate benefits in cerebrovascular and cognitive function.\nOnly a handful of studies have previously reported effects of flavanols on the human cerebral vasculature, both in a resting state26,27,28,29 and in response to cognitive challenges30,31,32, albeit in opposite directions (increase/decrease in blood flow/velocity). Further, modulation of cerebral physiological outcomes by flavanols in the context of neuronal/cognitive challenges frequently and surprisingly fail to translate into cognitive benefits26,30,31,32. A possibility is that the benefits of flavanols may only be visible at high levels of task difficulty. This highlights that, whilst some of these studies could provide ecological validity (as they target aging adults with cognitive and/or vascular problems), they were not designed in a manner that allows for an evaluation of the underlying physiological effects of these compounds in the human brain. This leaves some uncertainty about whether flavanols’ benefits in peripheral vascular function are reflected by similar effects on cerebrovascular reactivity, and whether the cognitive and vascular benefits are related.\nThere is a need to determine whether the peripheral vascular benefits of flavanols extend to the cerebral vasculature. This requires well-controlled experiments to demonstrate that flavanols (a) can modulate the brain’s vasculature; (b) that these effects, similarly to those found in the periphery, are revealed during physiological challenges likely involving the NO pathway; (c) that they affect cognitive performance, at least in challenging conditions; and (d) that cerebrovascular and cognitive benefits are linked.\nIn the current study, we employed separate physiological and cognitive challenges in a double-blind, within-subject, placebo-controlled acute (2 h) study to assess the underlying physiological actions of cocoa flavanols on cerebral and peripheral vascular and cognitive function. To measure cerebrovascular reactivity, we employed a CO2-breathing challenge (hypercapnia) before and after intake of either a high- or low-flavanol intervention. During hypercapnia, we measured cortical haemoglobin concentration using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)33, which allowed us to finely quantify the dynamics of cerebrovascular reactivity, providing information not only about the amplitude of this response, but also about its time course. Similar to peripheral measures, cerebral CO2-reactivity has been shown to be mediated by the NO pathway20, which is the hypothesized mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of flavanols on peripheral endothelial function6. To measure the cognitive effects of flavanols, we employed tasks with escalating levels of difficulty34, which could inform us of the level at which the cognitive benefits of flavanols may emerge.\nResults\nDietary flavanols improve cerebral oxygenation responses to hypercapnia\nFigure 1 reports the time course of oxy-(Fig. 1a) and deoxy-haemoglobin (Fig. 1b) concentration, averaged across cortical recording locations and participants, during the 5% CO2-breathing challenge (Fig. S1 shows mean ± SEM for both the oxygenation and deoxygenation time courses). Separate time courses are shown for the high- and low-flavanol conditions and for the measurement points before and following the flavanol intervention, where increases in oxy-haemoglobin and reductions in deoxy-haemoglobin concentration are associated with vasodilation induced by the hypercapnia. Two-way repeated-measure ANOVAs (with dietary intervention and time of measurement as factors) indicated that high-flavanol intake was associated with a larger oxygenation response: the interaction was significant for the amplitude of the response, measured as the average change during the period 3–4 min after CO2-breathing onset, F(1,16) = 6.08, p = 0.025 (Fig. 1c). Simple-main effects analyses revealed no differences at baseline (p = 0.993), but a significantly greater oxy-haemoglobin level after the high-flavanol in comparison to the low-flavanol (t(16) = − 2.37, p = 0.030) (1c). No significant differences between interventions were detected for deoxygenated haemoglobin (Fig. 1d).\nFigure 2 reports maps of the oxy-haemoglobin concentration changes (in z scores) at different times during the CO2-breathing challenge (at onset, and 1, 2, 3, and 4 min into the challenge), with darker grey background indicating the recording region. The maps show that increases in blood oxygenation were most evident in lateral frontal regions and that high-flavanol intake led to earlier and larger responses than the other three conditions, which were similar to each other (Fig. 2a). There was a significant interaction between intervention and the latency of response, measured as the time to reach 90% maximal oxygenation, F(1, 16) = 13.61, p = 0.002 (Fig. 2b), based on a jack-knife approach35. There were no significant differences at baseline (p = 0.429), but latency of oxygenation was significantly shorter (by approximately 1 min) after the high-flavanol intervention (t(16) = − 5.68, p < 0.001).\nEfficacy of the high-flavanol intervention on endothelial function, as measured by brachial FMD (Fig. S2), was confirmed, with significant increase of approximately 1% FMD after the high-flavanol in comparison to the low-flavanol intervention (p = < 0.001), as previously described in this population8.\nDietary flavanols improve cognitive performance when cognitive demand is high\nFigure 3 reports the behavioural effects of flavanol intake, using the inverse efficiency score (IES), a parameter summarizing reaction time and accuracy during behavioural tasks36,37,38. A lower IES value (expressed in seconds) indicates more efficient cognitive processing. As shown in Fig. 3a, the four different conditions represented progressively harder cognitive challenges. The Double-Stroop condition, in which conflict was present both for stimulus classification and response selection for maximum difficulty (Fig. S4), induced the slowest responses.\nResults indicate that only the Double-Stroop task differentiated between the high- and low-flavanols conditions. The interaction in the two-way repeated-measure ANOVA (with task condition and flavanol intervention as factors, and flavanol intervention order used as a covariate) was significant, F(3,48) = 3.267, p = 0.029. A planned contrast between the difference in the Double-Stroop and the average of the other three conditions yielded a significant cognitive advantage in the high flavanol versus low-flavanol condition, t(16) = 2.142, p = 0.042 (3b). The contrast of the Stroop task with the other two tasks was not significant, t(16) = 1.050, p = 0.309, confirming that flavanols only generated an advantage in the most difficult condition (Double-Stroop), but not in the other conditions.\nCerebrovascular reactivity effects predict behavioural effects across individuals\nIn the majority of individuals (13 out of 17, see Fig. 3c (i)) the haemodynamic oxygenation responses to hypercapnia matched the overall average and showed a faster and larger cerebrovascular response to the CO2-breathing challenge after the intake of high-flavanol in comparison to the low-flavanol intervention. However, some individuals (4 out of 17, see Fig. 3c (ii)) did not follow this pattern. To understand this better, we computed separate average time courses of the oxy-haemoglobin concentration changes induced by hypercapnia under high- and low-flavanols for these two groups (Fig. 3c). This figure indicates that, for the latter group (ii), the fNIRS waveforms were very similar after high- and low-flavanols intake (r = 0.864, indicating a strong replicability of the fNIRS waveforms across sessions), and reached a maximum lagged cross-correlation (r = 0.897) when the high-flavanols waveform was anticipated by 18 s relative to the low-flavanols waveform. In contrast, in most participants (N = 13), the fNIRS waveforms were not as strongly correlated at lag 0 (r = 0.567), but reached a much higher cross-correlation (r = 0.807, again suggesting good reproducibility) when the high-flavanols waveform was anticipated by 117 s relative to the low-flavanol waveform (i), the phenomenon reflected by the full group analyses (Fig. 1).\nCrucially, cerebrovascular reactivity to flavanols for these two sub-groups was predictive of the responsiveness to flavanols under the cognitive challenge. Figure 3d shows the behavioural interaction term (IES in the Double Stroop minus IES in other task conditions after high-flavanol relative to low-flavanols intake) in the two subgroups. The majority of participants (group i., i.e., individuals showing flavanols-induced improvements in cerebrovascular reactivity to CO2) showed a clear and significant improvement in performance in the Double Stroop (t(12) = − 3.784, p = 0.003, N = 13), whereas group ii (i.e., those individuals not showing flavanols-induced improvements in cerebrovascular reactivity to CO2) did not (t(3) = 0.86, p = 0.453, N = 4). This highlights the coupling of these two effects: those individuals showing improved cerebrovascular reactivity after high-flavanol intake also showed benefits during cognitive performance, whilst those that did not improve cognitive performance had no increase in cerebrovascular reactivity following high-flavanol intake.\nDiscussion\nThe present study shows, for the first time, that cocoa flavanols lead to more efficient tissue oxygenation responses in frontal areas of the brain during a CO2-challenge in healthy young individuals. This suggests that, similarly to peripheral vascular benefits, flavanols result in clinically relevant improvements in cerebrovascular reactivity in a healthy brain. Such benefits further translate into improvements on prefrontal-dependent cognitive performance, but only for the highest level of cognitive demand. More importantly, only individuals who benefited from flavanol intake during hypercapnia experienced cognitive benefits, suggesting that these effects are likely linked. Finally, we confirmed that flavanol’s benefits on peripheral endothelial function (1% brachial FMD) are in line with those reported in previous studies7,39 in this population within an acute timeframe (2 h), where maximal levels of flavanol metabolites reach circulation in humans13.\nFlavanols improve cerebrovascular reactivity in young adults\nThe use of fNIRS allowed us for the first time to observe how flavanol intake can modify the dynamics of cerebral tissue oxygenation: our data suggest that improved efficiency of the coupling between hypercapnia and vasodilation is driven by not only larger but also faster tissue oxygenation (Figs. 1, 2). This clearly indicates rapid acute improvements in cerebrovascular reactivity in the frontal cortex and is consistent with acute improvements in peripheral endothelial function in this population shown previously8 and replicated in this study (approx. 1% FMD improvement; see Supplementary Material Fig. S2). Flavanols’ ability to increase bioavailability of circulating NO in humans is believed to underlie its benefits on peripheral endothelial function6,40 and we suggest that this mechanism is also contributing to the benefits observed in cerebrovascular reactivity. Although a direct causal link between NO and hypercapnia-induced vasodilation in humans remains to be established41,42, previous studies have shown that inhibition of NO results in decreased reactivity to hypercapnia in cerebral arteries43,44. More importantly, pharmacological interventions that directly increase NO production and improve endothelial function, such as NO-donor sodium nitroprusside20,45 and L-Arginine (substrate for endothelial NO synthase)46 also result in improvements in CO2 reactivity of cerebral vessels in humans. This is consistent with the hypothesis that flavanols enhance hypercapnia-induced release of NO from endothelial cells locally within the cerebral vasculature.\nRecent evidence further suggests that hypercapnia induces vasodilation in the internal carotid artery (ICA, which supplies the frontal cortical areas assessed in the present study) by inducing increases in shear-rate47,48, which normally stimulates the production of NO by the endothelium49. This suggests a similar mechanism to brachial FMD, in which increases in shear-rate following hyperaemia result in NO-dependent arterial dilation50,51. As such, more efficient tissue oxygenation after flavanol intake might also be the result of NO-mediated increases in dilation of upstream cerebral conduit arteries (e.g., ICA) in response to hypercapnia.\nPrevious studies that assessed the impact of flavanols on the cerebrovasculature employed other imaging methods (fMRI, Transcranial Doppler) either at rest27,28 or during cognitive manipulations30,31, producing contradictory results (increases and declines in blood flow/velocity). However, neither of these contexts engages directly with NO within the vasculature, which might contribute to the discrepancy in outcomes.\nIn physiological, real-world conditions, flavanol-induced faster vascular reactivity may help recovery from injuries such as mild brain injury or stroke, conditions that are also associated with impaired cerebrovascular reactivity to CO252,53,54. Cerebrovascular reactivity to CO2 is also depressed in populations at higher risk for cardiovascular disease and cerebral small-vessel disease, as well as in aging45,55,56. Importantly, lower cerebrovascular reactivity has been consistently associated with cognitive impairments57, and shown to be predictive of future cognitive decline24. Therefore, if the acute benefits demonstrated in the present study were to be sustained by continued intake of flavanol-rich foods (e.g., grapes, apples, cocoa, berries, tea), this may be particularly beneficial for populations at higher risk.\nFlavanols improve cognitive performance only when level of cognitive demand is high\nOur behavioural findings indicate that flavanols can improve cognitive performance acutely in healthy young adults, but only when the level of cognitive demand is high (i.e., Double Stroop task; Fig. 3a,b). This indicates that assessment of flavanols’ effects on cognition requires challenging situations. The few previous acute studies in healthy young individuals showed inconsistent benefits across a variety of tasks, and, in particular, no benefits on a standard Stroop task31, a finding we replicate in our study. It has been previously suggested that failure to find cognitive effects in healthy young participants might be related to a high level of cognitive ability in this population, which is unlikely to be improved upon26. We suggest that the level of cognitive and physiological demands associated with the task are key factors, and we clearly demonstrate this by varying the level of conflict in the cognitive task used. Most interestingly, this indicates that flavanols may help cognition only when there is a substantial demand for information processing at the neuronal level, which, in turn, requires appropriate levels of blood oxygenation. Given the benefits in efficiency of cortical oxygenation we observed in the present study, we propose that flavanols may facilitate increases in blood oxygenation during complex tasks as a direct consequence of increased information processing demands in frontal cortical areas of the brain. Diets rich in dietary flavanols might be particularly beneficial when executive function becomes more limited (e.g., in older adults or individuals at higher risk for cognitive decline). Future work should focus on systematically employing difficulty-graded cognitive challenges when assessing the efficacy of dietary flavonoids on human cognitive function.\nCognitive and cerebrovascular individual responses to flavanols are linked\nAlthough measured separately, the extent of flavanol’s effects on measures of cerebrovascular reactivity in different individuals were predictive of their effects on cognitive measures in the same individuals. Specifically, only individuals for whom flavanols were effective in improving cerebrovascular reactivity (Fig. 3c) also showed behavioural improvement in challenging cognitive conditions (Fig. 3d), indicating a direct link between the cerebrovascular and cognitive effects of flavanols. This is the first time that such a relationship between hemodynamic and cognitive benefits of flavanols has been shown in a young healthy sample after a single dose of flavanols. Only one long-term flavanol intervention (3 months) study in older individuals has previously shown this link, with hippocampal-cognitive benefits being paralleled by increases in blood volume within the hippocampus (fMRI)29. Prior studies failed to link directly neurovascular benefits with cognitive benefits, when these are assessed simultaneously. For example, benefits in cognitive performance failed to reflect parallel improvements in neurovascular coupling, whilst changes in neurovascular coupling after flavanols did not result in cognitive improvements30,31. The disconnection between physiological and cognitive outcomes may be confounded by individual differences in responses to cognitive tasks. It is also possible that in some of these studies the cognitive tasks were not sufficiently challenging to demonstrate this relationship, as our results suggest.\nDemonstration of this relationship has one important implication: there are individual differences in the way in which young healthy adults respond to the intake of flavanols. In the current study, we observed that those individuals with negligible cerebrovascular benefits from flavanols (N = 4) were individuals with particularly large and rapid responses to hypercapnia at baseline (or after low-flavanol intake). This indicates that lack of flavanol efficacy may be due to a ceiling effect, with high baseline cerebrovascular reactivity leaving little room for improving it further. Most remarkable is the observation that these same individuals did not benefit cognitively from flavanol intake. In contrast, after flavanol intake, individuals with lower baseline cerebrovascular reactivity to hypercapnia were brought up to levels similar to those of the ‘high performers’, effectively equalizing individuals.\nVariability of the effects of flavanols on human vascular function have been reported previously and partially attributed to variations in flavanol metabolism and/or absorption: previous research reported up to 39% variability in flavanol plasma concentration after acute intake of flavanols in young adults58. However, previous research also suggests that these factors alone cannot explain the entirety of the variability observed in health benefits of these compounds59. Our data illustrate that there might be other factors at play: for example, there is evidence indicating that individuals with high cardiorespiratory fitness tend to have higher CO2 cerebrovascular reactivity60,61. While we did not assess the fitness of the participants in the present study, one possible explanation for the differential responses observed between sub-groups was that flavanols may have improved the cerebrovascular reactivity of less fit individuals to levels similar to those of potentially highly fit individuals. Future work should formally address this hypothesis, which may have significant translational implications.\nConclusions\nWe have demonstrated that acute flavanol intake can improve efficiency in blood oxygenation (amplitude and speed) during hypercapnia in frontal cortical areas of young healthy subjects and that it is likely to contribute to improvements in cognitive function, but only when cognitive demands are high. We also show that only individuals with lower baseline cerebrovascular reactivity benefit from flavanol intake, with acute improvements in cerebral vascular function and cognitive performance. We suggest that the underlying mechanisms at play centrally may be similar to the ones detected in the peripheral vasculature, through hypercapnia-induced increases in NO release from the endothelium in cerebral arteries. Future work should confirm this by conducting studies in animal models where direct assessments of NO levels in the cerebral vasculature are possible in real time during hypercapnic challenges.\nThe findings reported here can have important future implications for using dietary strategies containing plant-derived flavanols for enhancement of blood oxygenation and cognitive performance in healthy populations, as well as for populations at higher risk (e.g., smokers; hypertensives; diabetics; older adults) or to help recover and treat brain injuries and disease. Most importantly, our data can potentially open new avenues for precision-medicine research with regard to understanding individual responses to flavanol intake and helping to identify populations that might benefit the most from these interventions.\nLimitations\nfNIRS measures have high temporal sampling, which allow for studying the dynamics of oxygenation effects, but only provide information about superficial areas of the brain, which is a common limitation to all diffuse optical imaging measures. We also only focused on frontal cortical areas and observed that, within this region, the effects of flavanols in response to hypercapnia seemed to be relatively homogeneous. However, we are unable to establish whether there are regional differences across the brain. Whilst previous studies suggest that flavanols can increase NO in humans in an acute manner, in the present study we have not assessed NO species and cannot conclude that flavanol-induced responsiveness to hypercapnia is specifically linked to this mechanism. Other important limitations of this study are the low number of participants, particularly to address cognitive outcomes, and the exclusion of females. Additionally, the evaluation of efficacy of flavanol intake in an at-risk population (e.g. older adults) would have more ecological validity and this should be addressed in future work.\nMethods\nParticipants\nEighteen healthy male volunteers (18–45 years old) were recruited from the University of Birmingham and surrounding areas according to the following inclusion criteria: (i) non-smokers; (ii) normotensive; (iii) no history of cerebrovascular, cardiovascular or respiratory disease; (iv) no allergies or intolerances to ingredients present in cocoa powders; (v) not taking long-term medication (e.g., hyperlipidaemia or on antibiotics for the previous 3 months); (vi) not suffering from blood-clotting disorders; (vii) no known infections at the time of the study; (viii) not on a weight-reducing regimen (Table 1). Females were excluded from the study to ensure a more homogenous sample and to minimize the impact of hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle on vascular outcomes. Volunteers were asked to refrain from the following for the 24 h before the study: (1) consumption of polyphenol-rich foods including fruits, vegetables, cocoa, chocolate, coffee, tea, fruit juices and wine; (2) consumption of nitrates, including foods such as beetroot, spinach, lettuce, rocket, celery, parsley and cabbage (defined as containing > 50 mg nitrates/100 g fresh weight); (3) performing any type of vigorous physical exercise; and (4) consuming any alcoholic beverage. Volunteers were further asked to fast for 12 h before each study visit. All research was performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Informed consent was obtained from all the participants. The study was approved by the University of Birmingham Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Ethical Review Committee (ERN_17-1591).\nStudy design\nThe study was based on an acute, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over design. After ascertaining eligibility, participants attended two visits, separated by a minimum of two weeks, in which they consumed either a high-flavanol cocoa drink (HF) or a low-flavanol (LF) cocoa (control) drink, to which they, as well as the experimenters, remained blinded throughout the study (for composition of the two cocoa interventions see Table 2). In a third visit participants visited the University of Birmingham Imaging Centre to have a structural MRI brain scan. Participants were assigned a code, corresponding to the flavanol intervention for each visit according to a random allocation sequence. Compliance to the food and fasting requirements were assessed using 24-h dietary recall conducted at the beginning of each visit. On each visit, volunteers rested for 20 min in supine position in a quiet, temperature-controlled room before baseline measures were taken in this order: (i) diastolic and systolic blood pressure (BP); (ii) brachial artery FMD; (iii) fNIRS of frontal cortex oxygenation/deoxygenation at rest and during hypercapnia (5% CO2). Following baseline measurements volunteers consumed either the high-flavanol intervention or control low-flavanol intervention (within 10 min). Two hours post intake, BP, FMD and fNIRS-based optical reactivity to the hypercapnic challenge were assessed, as well as cognitive function using a Modified Stroop Task34. Cognitive function was assessed only at the 2-h point to minimize practice effects. During the time between ingestion of the beverage and post measurements, optical sources and detector locations were digitized (for each visit) using a Polhemus FASTRAK 3D Digitizer (Polhemus, Colchester, VT). The design of the cognitive tasks was not compatible with accurate fNIRS analysis, mainly due to the variable duration of the task between subjects and the small number of trials. Methods and results regarding the standard FMD and BP measures are included in supplementary materials.\nFlavanol-containing interventions\nIntervention beverages were prepared immediately prior to consumption by dissolving 8.3 g of cocoa powders in 300 ml of room temperature bottled water containing low levels of nitroso species (Buxton). The cocoa powders used are commercially available (Barry Callebaut, Switzerland): the low-flavanol control is a fat-reduced cocoa powder alkalized (commercial name: 10/12 DDP Royal Dutch) and the high-flavanol cocoa powder a non-alkalized fat reduced powder (‘Natural Acticoa’). Both are matched for macronutrient and micronutrient content (including caffeine and theobromine). The high-flavanol cocoa delivered 150 mg of (−)-epicatechin and 35.5 mg of catechin (flavanol monomers), whilst the low-flavanol intervention delivered < 4 mg of both monomers (Table 2). The dose of flavanol monomers used in the present study is in line with previous studies showing acute efficacy in modulating human endothelial function6,8,39 and plasma NO levels40. A similar dose of (−)-epicatechin could be achieved through diet by consuming foods rich in flavanols, particularly apples, black grapes, blackberries, cherries, raspberries, pears, pulses, green tea and red wine62. Total levels of polyphenols in the powders were assessed by a Folin-Ciocalteu reagent calorimetric assay as described previously63. Individual monomer levels and procyanidin levels as well as levels of methylxanthines, were confirmed by HPLC as described previously64,65. Maximal levels of flavanol monomers metabolites are reached in the human circulation at approximately 2 h post-intake13. Individual doses of cocoa powder were kept at − 20 °C and identified by a three-digit code to ensure double-blindness. Intervention beverages were identical in texture, consistency and taste, and were delivered to participants in an opaque container with an opaque straw. Participants and researchers involved in data collection and analysis were blind to the intervention conditions until all data analysis was completed.\nOptical recording\nOptical data were recorded using an Imagent2 fNIRS device (ISS Inc., Champaign, IL.), based on 32 sources (16 0.4 mm optical fibres connected to laser-diodes emitting light at 690 nm and 16 at 830 nm) and 14 detectors (3 mm fibre-optic bundles linked to photomultiplier tubes, PMTs). Source and detector fibres were held in place using custom-built helmets matched to a range of head circumferences. Hair was combed away from the points of contact between detectors and scalp, whilst the smaller source fibres allowed them to be placed directly through the hair onto the scalp. Source fibres were paired such that each location was illuminated by two fibres connected to one 830 nm and one 690 nm laser, but the two fibres were never on at the same time. Each detector received light from 16 time-multiplexed sources, which stayed on for a period of 1.398 ms and off for 20.971 ms, yielding an effective sampling rate of 44.704 Hz. To avoid crosstalk between channels (i.e., source-detector pairs), the optical montage ensured that a detector could not receive light from more than one source contacting the head at less than 70 mm distance at any one time.\nStructural MRI acquisition and co-registration with optical data\nAll participants underwent a high-resolution structural MRI scan in a 3-T Philips Achieva MRI scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, Netherlands). A whole-head T1-weighted anatomical image was produced using an MPRAGE sequence with 1 mm3 resolution. All MRI scanning was carried out either for the purpose of this study or acquired from previous studies with the written consent of the participant and original researcher, with the following parameters: flip angle = 8◦, TE = 3.8 ms, TR = 8.39 ms, inversion time = 1150 ms, 175 sagittal slices, voxel size 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm with a field of view of 288 × 232 × 175 mm (FH x AP x RL). The structural MRI was used for co-registration of optical data onto each individual’s anatomy66 using nasion and pre-auricular points as references, the spatial locations of sources and detectors were digitized. Digitization points were then co-registered with T1 structural MRI scans, following procedures described by66. This approach has been shown to have errors of less than 4 mm66,67. See supplementary Figure S3 for an optical montage superimposed on the structural MRI of a representative participant.\nHypercapnia\nHypercapnia was induced with 5% CO2 (in air) via the open-circuit Douglas bag method. Once participants were instrumented with the fNIRS device, baseline data were collected while breathing room air for 4 min, followed by 4 min breathing the 5% CO2 gas mixture (hypercapnia), then a 2-min recovery period breathing room air68. Respiratory gases were analysed for changes in end-tidal CO2 using a continuous gas analyser (ML206, AD Instruments, Dunedin, New Zealand). Throughout this hypercapnic cerebrovascular reactivity procedure, participants remained seated whilst optical data were recorded.\nCognitive performance\nCognitive performance was assessed using a modified Stroop task34,69 (see supplementary Fig. S4). The task assesses cognitive processes related to selective attention and prepotent response inhibition during decision making, with increasing task demands across levels. It involves the presentation of colour words (e.g., RED) displayed in either congruent (e.g., red) or incongruent (e.g., blue) colours, alongside two control trial blocks in which only one dimension of the stimuli is presented: either colour words presented in black or colour blocks without words (Fig. S4A,B and C,D). At the most difficult level (Fig. S4 panels G,H), the modified Stroop presents task blocks that include two forms of conflict (at stimulus classification and at response selection, (double Stroop, Fig. S4G, H), rather than one form of conflict (at stimulus classification) as used in the standard Stroop Task (Fig. S4E,F). This allowed for a comparison between simpler and more demanding conditions. Previous work demonstrated that performance in the double-Stroop task results in lower performance (i.e., longer response times and lower accuracy) than the standard Stroop task, but it can be improved by interventions (e.g., exercise) in young healthy adults34, confirming the suitability of this task for the current study. The tasks involved four blocks of 40 trials in which participants responded by pressing the bottom left (‘z’) or right (‘/’) key, corresponding to response options displayed on the screen (supplementary Fig. S4). Note that the simplest two task blocks tested identification of a colour word presented in a neutral colour (word task) and recognition of the colour of a patch (colour task). Blocks 3 and 4 both required participants to identify the colour of the text whilst ignoring or inhibiting the prepotent response to the word name. The third block (Stroop task) had response options printed in a neutral colour (black), whilst the fourth block added a further form of conflict by presenting the response options in conflicting coloured text, requiring participants to inhibit a second prepotent response stimulus (“double-Stroop”).\nData analysis\nOptical Processing and hemodynamic responses during hypercapnia\nOptical data were obtained for 10 min epochs starting 4 min before the beginning of the 5% CO2-breathing challenge. Channel pairs (composed of a 690 and 830 nm pair of channels from the same source and detector locations) with an average AC count < 100 digitizing units for either wavelength were discarded. For the remaining channels, raw fNIRS signals were normalised by dividing each value by the mean value across the time points for each block and channel. To determine the overall haemodynamic response across CO2 manipulations, data were corrected for vascular pulsation70,71. Pulse-corrected data were then motion corrected72 and low-pass (zero-phase shift) filtered at 0.05 Hz. The data were then down-sampled to one value every 9 s, and the changes in light intensities for each sample and channel pair were transformed into oxy- and deoxy-haemoglobin concentration changes using the Beer–Lambert law73. Finally, to eliminate the effects of non-brain phenomena, the time course of the response for channels with the shortest source-detector distance (< 15 mm, unlikely to be affected by brain phenomena) was regressed out from each channel data74. In-house software Opt-3D75 was used to merge channels whose diffusion paths intersected within a given brain volume (modelled as a curved ellipsoid path76). Only source-detector distances within a 20–50 mm range were used for analysis, in order to focus on signal extraction from deeper brain regions and exclude superficial tissue effects, dominant at shorter source-detector distances. An 8-mm spatial filter was applied to spatially reconstructed source-detector data, which were projected onto the axial surface of a model brain image in Talairach space. The data from 1 volunteer were excluded from fNIRS analysis due to excessive noise.\nStatistics/power analysis\nfNIRS and FMD and cognitive data were analysed using two-way repeated measures ANOVA with intervention (low- or high-flavanol) and time (0, 2 h) as within-subject factors. Cognitive data were analysed using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with intervention (low- or high-flavanol) and task levels (Word, Colour, Stroop, Double Stroop) as within-subject factors. fNIRS data were averaged across the whole cortical area recorded for each participant. Planned a priori comparisons between high and low-flavanol were tested by 2-tailed t-tests. Significance was defined as p < 0.05 (95% CI) for all outcome measures. Sample size was estimated based on previous data from our laboratory on flavanol acute changes in brachial FMD in this population (mean = 5.47; SD = 1.34): the selected sample size (N = 18) was expected to afford us a 95% probability of detecting a difference (i.e., power = 0.95) of 0.6% FMD (the expected effect size) due to flavanol intake, using an alpha value of α = 0.05.\nData availability\nThe datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\nReferences\nCassidy, A. et al.

MURIC made the assertion on Monday, 16th November, 2020 while responding to a suit filed by a Lagos-based lawyer, Malcolm Omirhobo. MURIC’s statement was issued by its director and founder, Professor Ishaq Akintola.\nOmirhobo argued that the Arabic inscription on naira notes portray Nigeria as an Islamic state contrary to the country’s constitutional status of a secular state. The lawyer also filed a similar suit against the Nigerian Army seeking the removal of Arabic inscriptions from its logo. The cases are being heard before Justice Mohammed Liman at the Lagos High Court. (https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2020/11/10/cbn-opposes-suit-to-remove-arabic-inscriptions-from-banknotes/)\nBut according to MURIC, “Omirhobo’s approach is not only naïve, it is pedestrian and kindergarten. This suit against Arabic on naira manifests acute desertification of religious tolerance, exhibition of undiluted acrobatic religiousity, NAFDAC-registered gymnastic spirituality and Oxford cum Harvard-certificated ignorance.\n“How many times do we need to tell our Christian neighbours that Nigeria is not a secular but a multi-religious state. A secular state is one that does not recognize religion as in communist states. But Nigeria recognizes all the religions in the country and the Constitution also begins with the words ‘under God’. Secular states do not recognize the existence of God.\n“The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 says inter alia at its very beginning, ‘We the people of the Federal Republic of Nigeria: having firmly and solemnly resolved : to live in unity and harmony as one indivisible and indissoluble sovereign Nation under God…’ So how can Nigeria be a secular state when we are ‘under God’? In addition, nowhere in the whole constitution was the word ‘secular’ ever used and we challenge anyone who can find that word from the constitution to mention the chapter, section and sub-section.\n“Seeking to remove Arabic from the naira is the height of ignorance because Arabic is just a language like English or French, not a religion. By the way, what is on the naira is not even Arabic. It is ‘Ajami’ using Arabic letters as a form of transliteration. Even if Omirhobo single-handedly succeeds in removing Arabic from the naira, is he going to remove the numerals 5, 10, 100, 1000 indicating the denominations as well? If he cannot, then he still has a long way to go because even those numbers are Arabic.\n“The numerical system (1, 2, 3, 4, etc) were invented by a Muslim mathematician by name Alkhawarizmi (died 850) in the 9th century. Nay and more than that. Whereas ancient Greeks had men like Plato, Aristotle, Euclide, Thales, Theodocius, etc whose scientific theories only managed to survive their times and Europe boasts today of scholars like Nicholas Copernicus, Francis Bacon, Galileo Galilei, Rene Descartes and Isaac Newton with their moribund and Godless postulates, the list of renowned Muslim scientists is endless.\n“The truth is that religious fanatics have grown paranoia about Islam and they arrogate the Arabic language to the religion alone whereas this is not true. Their hatred for Islam and the Muslims is transferred to the Arabic language. This transferred aggression beclouded their perspicacity to the extent that they fail to realize that Islam is not synonymous with Arabic language.\n“For instance, Israel’s currency has Arabic inscription on it. Nigerian Christians who go on pilgrimage to Jerusalem every year spend Israel’s money and see Arabic on it. Did they tear it into pieces in anger? They did not ask the Israeli authorities to remove the Arabic on their currency but when they return to Nigeria they maintain their hardline opposition to Arabic on naira. Where is objectivity? Is this not articulated religiousity?\n“Again, hardly would any imported electronic gadget enter Nigeria without its manual containing an Arabic section. That is business sense, not religion. But Muslim-haters are swayed by emotion and they cannot separate the wheat from the chaff. Common sense is not so common. Of course there are still Christians who are moderate, liberal and realistic. They are the few exceptions who will not allow themselves to be led by the nose.\n“One major argument against the removal of Arabic from the naira is that a large percentage of the Nigerian population will be cut off from our monetary system if Arabic is removed from the naira because Arabic is one of the local languages in Nigeria. It is used by the Shuwa Arabs in Borno State. Therefore Arabic cannot be a foreign language.\n“Furthermore, the Bible used by Christians in Israel, Egypt, Palestine, Libya, Syria and other Arab countries are printed in Arabic language only because that is the only language they understand. Does that make the Bible an Islamic Bible? Their church services are conducted in Arabic. Have those churches become mosques?\n“Interestingly enough, God is called Allah in the Arabic Bible. If Arab Christians want to say ‘God is great’, they also say ‘Allahu Akbar’. To thank God they say ‘alhamdulilah’ just like Muslims. The population of Palestine is 12 million and 7% (about 840,000) of this number are Christians. Yet the language of this 7% is Arabic. Perhaps Omirhobo will like to apply to the International Court at the Hagues to reject them as Christians because they speak Arabic?\n“Omirhobo’s argument that Arabic on naira notes portrays Nigeria as an Islamic state holds no water because if Arabic is Islam, then English is Christianity. Hence if Arabic on the naira note is Islamisation, non-Arabic letters on the same naira is Christianisation. By extension, if the use of Arabic is Islamisation, the use of English language in Nigeria, particularly as a lingua franca, is the mother of all christianisation.\n“For equity, therefore, Nigeria should have two official languages: Arabic and English with priority and emphasis in that alphabetical order. But in their magnanimity, tolerance and wisdom, Nigerian Muslims have not come forward to demand that Arabic should be Nigeria’s second official language. For that reason alone, the plaintiff’s request for the removal of Arabic from the naira is frivolous, petty, selfish, myopic and parochial.\n“Perhaps the plaintiff thinks Nigerian Muslims were the ones who initiated the inscription of Arabic on both the army badge and the naira notes. Omirhobo needs to be told that even the colonial masters inscribed Arabic on the currency printed by Britain and used in Nigeria. The words: ‘pound daya’, i.e. one pound was inscribed on colonial currency. Omirhobo may therefore need to sue the Queen of England.\n“To continue along the lanes of history, it was not even Nigerian Muslim leaders who brought the idea of Arabic in the Nigerian currency in post-independence Nigeria. The man who initiated it was a Christian, a Urhobo officer by name General David Akpode Ejoor (rtd). He was the one who introduced the Arabic inscription and the Star emblem into the Nigeria Army crest. He was given the assignment and research led him to pick the Arabic words ‘nasrun minallahi’ (meaning ‘victory is from God’) and a committee made up of three ministers of the First Republic : Muhammadu Ribadu (Defence), Festus Okotie-Eboh (Finance) and Yar'adua (Works and Housing) approved his choice. Ejoor confirmed this in his book ‘Reminiscences’ (page 16).\n“The Christian who took the Central Bank of Nigeria to court claiming the country has been Islamized because of the Arabic inscription on the naira note failed to see how heavily Nigeria has been Christianized by observing Saturday as a public holiday because of the Seventh Day Adventists and Sunday because of other Christians. But the Muslims are not given any day at all.\n“MURIC appeals to Nigerians not to allow the fear mongers and merchants of hate continue to spread fear and sow discord among us. Many of those saddled with the task of uniting us have become instruments of division. Ex-President Jonathan is an example. He removed Arabic from the naira because he listened to hate preachers whom he took along on his futile but numerous trips to Jerusalem. They indoctrinated him into believing that Arabic on the naira implies Islamisation. Although he saw Arabic on Israeli currency on his trips to Jerusalem, yet he swallowed the lie hook, line and sinker. Of course it cost him his much-coveted second term because his action had been rightly interpreted as anti-Muslim.\n“We charge Nigerians to open up their minds in order to avoid becoming victims of accidental civilisation or, worse still, educated illiterates. Arabic is not Islam and Islam is not Arabic. One is a language, the other is a religion.

MURIC made the assertion on Monday, 16th November, 2020 while responding to a suit filed by a Lagos-based lawyer, Malcolm Omirhobo. MURIC’s statement was issued by its director and founder, Professor Ishaq Akintola.\nOmirhobo argued that the Arabic inscription on naira notes portray Nigeria as an Islamic state contrary to the country’s constitutional status of a secular state. The lawyer also filed a similar suit against the Nigerian Army seeking the removal of Arabic inscriptions from its logo. The cases are being heard before Justice Mohammed Liman at the Lagos High Court. (https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2020/11/10/cbn-opposes-suit-to-remove-arabic-inscriptions-from-banknotes/)\nBut according to MURIC, “Omirhobo’s approach is not only naïve, it is pedestrian and kindergarten.

A secular state is one that does not recognize religion as in communist states. But Nigeria recognizes all the religions in the country and the Constitution also begins with the words ‘under God’. Secular states do not recognize the existence of God.\n“The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 says inter alia at its very beginning, ‘We the people of the Federal Republic of Nigeria: having firmly and solemnly resolved : to live in unity and harmony as one indivisible and indissoluble sovereign Nation under God…’ So how can Nigeria be a secular state when we are ‘under God’? In addition, nowhere in the whole constitution was the word ‘secular’ ever used and we challenge anyone who can find that word from the constitution to mention the chapter, section and sub-section.\n“Seeking to remove Arabic from the naira is the height of ignorance because Arabic is just a language like English or French, not a religion. By the way, what is on the naira is not even Arabic. It is ‘Ajami’ using Arabic letters as a form of transliteration. Even if Omirhobo single-handedly succeeds in removing Arabic from the naira, is he going to remove the numerals 5, 10, 100, 1000 indicating the denominations as well? If he cannot, then he still has a long way to go because even those numbers are Arabic.\n“The numerical system (1, 2, 3, 4, etc) were invented by a Muslim mathematician by name Alkhawarizmi (died 850) in the 9th century. Nay and more than that. Whereas ancient Greeks had men like Plato, Aristotle, Euclide, Thales, Theodocius, etc whose scientific theories only managed to survive their times and Europe boasts today of scholars like Nicholas Copernicus, Francis Bacon, Galileo Galilei, Rene Descartes and Isaac Newton with their moribund and Godless postulates, the list of renowned Muslim scientists is endless.\n“The truth is that religious fanatics have grown paranoia about Islam and they arrogate the Arabic language to the religion alone whereas this is not true. Their hatred for Islam and the Muslims is transferred to the Arabic language. This transferred aggression beclouded their perspicacity to the extent that they fail to realize that Islam is not synonymous with Arabic language.\n“For instance, Israel’s currency has Arabic inscription on it. Nigerian Christians who go on pilgrimage to Jerusalem every year spend Israel’s money and see Arabic on it. Did they tear it into pieces in anger? They did not ask the Israeli authorities to remove the Arabic on their currency but when they return to Nigeria they maintain their hardline opposition to Arabic on naira. Where is objectivity? Is this not articulated religiousity?\n“Again, hardly would any imported electronic gadget enter Nigeria without its manual containing an Arabic section. That is business sense, not religion.

I'm a quarter century younger than Joe Biden, so I figure I've got plenty of time to make any further decisions,\" Walker said.\nIn another segment, the lawmaker who will be leading Assembly Republicans' investigation into the Nov. 3 election said his committee will begin hearings within days.\nRep. Ron Tusler, R-Harrison, who chairs the Assembly Committee on Campaigns and Elections, said the committee will issue subpoenas if necessary.\n\"Right now, we've received over 3500 complaints or concerns just in my office, and I'm one of 99 state representatives, and other representatives have received an awful lot too,\" Tusler said. \"We're in the process of going through those concerns and trying to analyze which issues are the issues that are coming up the most often, which issues are the issues people are the most concerned about. And really trying to focus on that.\"\nHe said the investigation is being done in response to voters' concerns.\n\"That's where this investigation comes from. It comes from folks that are contacting our office and saying 'Look, I'm concerned about this election, I'm concerned about the results, I'm concerned about something that happened in some other part of the state that maybe I don't even live in, and I really want you to take a look at it and make sure this was fair,'\" Tusler said.\nTrump has made unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud on Nov. 3.\nWisconsin's chief election official, Meagan Wolfe of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said the election \"was conducted according to law and in the open.\""}, {"claim": "The COVID-19 vaccine produced by AstraZeneca and Oxford University can change a person's DNA.", "required_reannotation": true, "label": "Refuted", "justification": "Evidence concludes that the COVID-19 vaccines cannot alter a person's DNA.

So I went digging into the Edison data [ https://static01.nyt.com/elections-assets/2020/data/api/2020-11-03/race-page/pennsylvania/president.json] and I found this damning evidence [ https://i.maga.host/RNPN3Oz.png ]. As can be seen in the image, only 54 votes were added, but the ratio changed in Biden's favor by a whole 0.6%! This is proof that not only did the glitch happen, but it doesn't seem to have been reverted at all.\nEDIT : BIG UPDATE, I made a script to run through the data and gather all instances where votes switched from Trump to Biden, Lost Votes means that the total amount of votes counted decreased by that amount throughout the counting. I've only done states that use Dominion Voting Systems so far.\nEDIT 2: Added ALL the states, and separated by voting systems, although no state uses exclusively one system as far as I know.\nEdit 3: Re-ordered the states, first by switched votes, then by lost votes.\n🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨\nSwitched votes are votes that were taken from Trump and given to Biden.\nLost votes are voted that disappeared during the counting, from both candidates.\nThere might be a small overlap between Switched votes and Lost votes.\n🚨🚨🚨WE DECIDED TO LEAVE THIS NUMBERS UP SO YOU CAN SEE HOW OUR RESEARCH HAS EVOLVED.🚨🚨🚨\nDominion Voting Systems :\nPennsylvania : Switched : 220,883 Lost Votes : 941,248\nNew Jersey : Switched : 80,242 Lost Votes : 20\nFlorida : Switched : 21,422 Lost Votes : 456\nMichigan : Switched : 20,213 Lost Votes : 21,882\nNew York : Switched : 18,124 Lost Votes : 623,213\nGeorgia : Switched : 17,407 Lost Votes : 33,574\nOhio : Switched : 14,965 Lost Votes : 5,102\nVirginia : Switched : 12,163 Lost Votes : 789,023\nCalifornia : Switched : 7,701 Lost Votes : 10,989\nArizona : Switched : 4,492 Lost Votes : 0\nMinnesota : Switched : 2,766 Lost Votes : 195,650\nTennessee : Switched : 2,330 Lost Votes : 0\nLouisiana : Switched : 2,322 Lost Votes : 0\nIllinois : Switched : 2,166 Lost Votes : 54,730\nWisconsin : Switched : 2,078 Lost Votes : 3,408\nColorado : Switched : 1,809 Lost Votes : 0\nUtah : Switched : 1,627 Lost Votes : 0\nNew Hampshire : Switched : 973 Lost Votes : 116\nIowa : Switched : 938 Lost Votes : 477\nNew Mexico : Switched : 268 Lost Votes : 4,610\nMissouri : Switched 0 : Lost Votes : 20,730\nNevada : Switched : 0 Lost Votes : 0\nAlaska : Switched : 0 Lost Votes : 0\nWashington : Switched : 0 Lost Votes : 0\nHawaii : Switched : 0 Lost Votes : 0\nKansas and Texas use Premier Election Solutions, owned by Dominion Voting Systems.\nTexas : Switched : 14,954 Lost Votes : 30,557\nKansas : Switched : 1,674 Lost Votes : 2,154\nElection Systems & Software :\nNebraska : Switched : 30,086 Lost Votes : 50\nKentucky : Switched : 8,129 Lost Votes : 23,849\nArkansas : Switched : 3,664 Lost Votes : 20,748\nSouth Carolina : Switched : 2,779 Lost Votes : 2,119\nMontana : Switched : 2,330 Lost Votes : 1,276\nSouth Dakota : Switched : 1,347 Lost Votes : 1\nNorth Dakota : Switched : 234 Lost Votes : 681\nMaryland : Switched : 203 Lost Votes : 0\nNorth Carolina : Switched : 0 Lost Votes : 15\nDistrict of Columbia : Switched : 0 Lost Votes : 0\nUnknown Systems:\nNebraska : Switched : 30,086 Lost Votes : 50\nConnecticut : Switched : 3,834 Lost Votes : 272\nMassachusetts : Switched : 3,613 Lost Votes : 51\nOregon : Switched 2,557 Lost Votes : 0\nAlabama : Switched : 1,170 Lost Votes : 408\nMississippi : Switched : 355 Lost Votes : 0\nMaine : Switched : 271 Lost Votes : 35\nRhode Island : Switched : 6 Lost Votes : 13\nWest Virginia : Switched : 0 Lost Votes : 78,300\nIdaho : Switched 0 Lost Votes : 0\nOklahoma : Switched : 0 Lost Votes : 0\nIndiana : Switched : 0 Lost Votes : 0\nDelaware : Switched : 0 Lost Votes : 0\nVermont : Switched : 0 Lost Votes : 0\nNOTE : Lost votes are votes that disappeared, not only for Trump, but overall.\nVERIFIED!!!!:\nI went looking through the data I got from my script, trying to find if the moment the Antrim glitch happened in Michigan is there. And it is. Here is the Data. [ https://static01.nyt.com/elections-assets/2020/data/api/2020-11-03/race-page/michigan/president.json ]\nAnd here is the specific part when the switch happened. [ https://i.maga.host/wGuVGZQ.png ]\nYou can see in that picture, that Trump lost 3,096 votes, those all went to Biden. BUT, Trump also lost 2,324 votes, that went nowhere.\nEDIT: Those 2,324 were moved from Trump to Jorgensen.\nJorgensen votes = Total votes * (1 - Trump share - Biden share)\nNr.27 : 573,857 * (1 - 0.578 - 0.401) = 12,051\nNr.28 : 574,417 * (1 - 0.568 - 0.406) = 14,935\nJorgensen vote increase from Nr.27 to Nr.28 = 14,935 - 12,051 = 2,884\nTotal vote increase from Nr.27 to Nr.28 = 574,417 - 573,857 = 560\nJorgensen vote increase - Total vote increase = 2,884 - 560 = 2,324\nSOURCES: Here is the data I used:\nEDISON DATA: https://static01.nyt.com/elections-assets/2020/data/api/2020-11-03/race-page/pennsylvania/president.json\nhttps://workupload.com/file/LVcwK7AAD8p\nThe data is from Edison Research, it is used for election coverage by at least ABC News, CBS News, CNN and NBC News. It is also used for the website of the NYT, and probably others as well.\n🚨🚨FROM THE EDISON WEBSITE \"Vote Count The NEP provides media organizations with real-time vote results in all 50 states for statewide races, ballot initiatives and House races\" 🚨🚨\nhttpss://i.maga.host/wvRRA9m.png\nI scraped the data from the NYT website, here [ https://static01.nyt.com/elections-assets/2020/data/api/2020-11-03/race-page/pennsylvania/president.json ] to check for other states, replace \"pennsylvania\" in the link with the state you want to check, for states that have spaces in their names, like new york, write new-york instead.\nTake this picture for example. [ https://i.maga.host/RNPN3Oz.png ]\nIt's like this:\nNr.187 : 2,984,468(Total votes) * 0.566(Trump share of the votes) = 1,689,208.888\nNr.188 : 2,984,522 * 0.56 = 1,671,332.32\nDo the same thing for Biden, and you'll see that he gained the votes that Trump lost.\nI made a program that basically checks every single change in votes, does the above to check if votes were switched, then adds them all up to get the total amount of switched votes.\nHere is the link to a rar file containing all the .json files for the states, and the fraudcatch.py file, you'd need to download python 3.8.2 to use it, click EDIT with idle, then in the window that pops up click Run, to check how many votes were switched from Trump to Biden in a state, you then type findfraud('hawaii') for example, replace hawaii with the name of the file of the state you want to check, the file for new hampshire is named newhamp for example, so findfraud('newhamp'), to check the total lost votes (For both candidates) do lostvotes('newhamp') for example. https://workupload.com/file/s7s8SARjjqh\n[pede444wow] I took the json files that are included here, and wrote a python script to convert the critical data to one csv file, so you can analyze it in excel:\npython script: https://pastebin.com/Q6nTP04N\nresult csv file: (download and save to csv file, then open in excel) https://pastebin.com/FQuxxTvK\n[montag] Here's a GitHub repo of the same data source taken at incremental time periods. https://github.com/favstats/USElection2020-NYT-Results\n[ComeAndTakeIt_Texas] Hey TrumanBlack, I crunched the 27/28 timestamp data you posted (specifically this - https://i.maga.host/wGuVGZQ.png), and uploaded a spreadsheet analysis here (https://i.maga.host/xbwnVuk.png). I do a worst-case and best-case rounding error to generate Max T Vote, Min T Vote, and Max B Vote and Min B Vote that shows if you have 0.578 share, the max number that would represent would be 0.57849999999, and the min number would be 0.5775. The specific pic highlighted here allows no possible way whatsoever that Trump did not lose votes. The smallest number of votes he could have lost assuming in 27 there is a worst case rounding error and in the 28 step there is a best case rounding error (extremely unlikely), Trump lost a 4846.353. In worst case, he lost 5994.627 votes. There is literally NO way anyone can explain this away. They can also not explain that away as an asynchronous issue, as the timestamp itself is later (1), and (2), the total vote count increased. This single time step is proof alone.\n[warpigpede] Re: the data displayed inhttps://i.maga.host/wGuVGZQ.png\nI calculated number of lost Trump votes as 5738.57, exactly 1% of the total number of votes (573857) at record 27:\nvotes 27: 573857\ntrump fraction: 0.578\ntrump votes: 331689.346\nbiden fraction: 0.401\nbiden votes: 230116.657\nvotes 28: 574417\ntrump fraction: 0.568\ntrump vote: 325950.776\nbiden vote: 232985.942\nbiden fraction: 0.406\nvotes change: +560\ntrump votes change: -5738.57\nExactly 1% is an awfully curious value.

Don’t waste resources trying to fix the whole fucking mess of a state that is Michigan, test out the theory in an easy, small place to count first.\n88% is an unusually high voter turnout. That alone deserves an audit.\nhttps://www.1011now.com/2020/11/04/live-at-130pm-recap-of-nebraska-general-election/\nNebraska exceeded its previous turnout record in terms of total votes cast, which was in the 2016 Presidential General Election, by about 68,000 votes. The unofficial overall turnout was 936,106, which is 74 percent of votes cast.\nThirty-four counties had a turnout of more than 80 percent. Four counties had a turnout of 88 percent. The turnout will increase as 20,000 - 25,000 early ballots that were dropped off Tuesday still need to be processed along with provisional ballots.\nEarly ballots that were mailed in or dropped off totaled 436,269.\nSend this to to your legislatures.\nNebraskan here... Nobody I know understood how in the world Sasse could get more votes than Trump. Half the republicans here despise Sasse. It didn’t pass the eye or smell test.\nagree. its likely more of a dominion play... Nebraska probably runs a more honest operation at its polling / counting centers. It probably doesn't have Tamany hall-like egregious in your face fraud like in Philly. Not as many dead voters and torn up ballets etc. So the fraud is more of a pure play electronic fraud by Dominion / Scorecard / Hammer.\nhttps://thedonald.win/p/11PpYclsta/x/c/1ATC4nkGM2\nTotally agree. Switching 30,000 votes would be a waste in the state of Nebraska as a whole, as it wouldn’t change anything.\nBut, if those 30,000 votes were switched in Nebraska’s 2nd district (Omaha), a switch like that would have been more than enough to win that 1 electoral vote.\nYep. I’m in Omaha and was confused how Biden won.\nLOL @ New York\nI bet Cuomo was so terrified of Trump turning NY red.\nWith that we don't need PA or MI.\n229 + 3(AK) + 10(WI) + 16(GA) + 11(AZ) + 1 (NE2) = 270\nAnd it's in somewhere people would normally assume no one would care, and there is no easy way to rationalize another explanation for why it happened, but proportionally, the vote swing is Massive compared to the others, and it just happened to be in a hard red area that was a key area for the electoral college despite no campaiging. There was also a much bigger difference between Trump's vote vs the GOP vote there.\nI picked a random precinct in Douglas County(Nebraska), 8-12. Here is the breakdown for Rep, Dem and Ind (the 47 total votes for the Libertarian is close enough to the # of registered Libertarians so I didn't include them in this analysis)....\n8-12 Registered R - 813 Registered D - 833 Registered I - 635\nVoter turnout was 72%, so as unscientific as it is, lets just assume 72% across the board. And lets assume ALL Rs vote R and ALL Ds vote D.\nWhere the INDEPENDENTS voted: Trump 32% Biden 68% Republican Bacon 51.5% Democrat Eastman 48.5%\nThe Presidential and Congressional races were within 2 votes of eachother. Just for\nFor some reason the participation in the SENATE race for Douglas Co 8-12 was only 64.7% (compared to 72% for Pres and Con). Using the data in the same way would mean for the Senate race in Douglas Co 8-12, Independents voted....\nRepublican Sasse 73% Democrat Janicek 9.7% Libertarian Siadek 17.3%\nThis was 1 precinct that I chose randomly because the registration seemed to be pretty even and my theory would have been that Trump would get 95% of Republicans, 10-15% of Democrats and 50%++ of Independents and that voter turnout for Republicans would be higher than Dems because of enthusiasm, but I of course had a biased opinion, but I live in Nebraska and I see what I see.\nJust curious why you think NE is the smoking gun. I live in Nebraska and couldn’t believe one of our votes went to Biden. Thanks.\nNot sure what he meant, but maybe since NE doesn't have massive election fraud from every direction happening at the same time, it would be easier to highlight the election software \"glitch\".\nNot OP, but I don't even live in NE and I couldn't believe it! Makes me feel vindicated hearing it from someone else who lives there.\nhttps://thedonald.win/p/11Q8O2xUQg/is-any-one-else-bothered-by-the-/\nThe fact that the republican in the NE2 congressional race got more votes in Douglas county than Trump is mighty fishy.\nLiving in Nebraska, can you explain why there would be a disconnect with the downballet voting? Do you think there are that many cross ballet voters?\nLaughs in West Virginia\nWith that we don't need PA or MI.\n229 + 3(AK) + 10(WI) + 16(GA) + 11(AZ) + 1 (NE2) = 270\nI think virginia and new york are.\nLook how fucking close new york was. Imagine if democrats didnt have that hub of influence.\nAnd Virginia is home to basically every dc crony. Look how overwhelmingly desperate they are.\nThose states worry me not for Biden, because Biden is done. Those states illustrate it goes beyond him. Its \"systemic\".\nI live in New York and I think Trump really won New York. That's why they haven't updated the count in almost a week. Look at how many Trump votes were removed from the tally plus how many were switched from Trump to Biden. In addition the areas that haven't been counted are heavily pro Trump. I believe they don't know what to do and aren't updating because they want Trump not to realize how close he is in New York. Even with this fraud once they add in the other areas the margin will get even tighter. That's 29 electoral votes....\nHow come? I looked at it but I don't see the smoking gun.\nThis looks sketchy af and its asking for a ton of PII and your account is 2 days old. This has self dox honeypot written all over it.\nI dont like the smell of this. 2 day old account? We are dealing with deep state operations so have someone verify.\nAs far as I can tell, Dominion did not use any protection. No passwords. No Secure Network, nothing. It's like they don't pay programmers. Had them set up probably contract-basis. And has English major interns running the software. Attempt at plausible deniability? Or stupidity? I mean double-check the work, but don't see an angle how this could benefit the deep State. anons being red pilled as they dug. Remember, a lot of the anons are/were apolitical, this is just a fun rabbithole game to them, but saw a few anons get pissed at the corruption. Probably a big red pill when you discover (and see) the data. I did see one anon group that was likely deep state or Dems just doing a parody thread of an anon. easy to click somewhere else. Don't block posts unless they post something worth blocking. Better that than block a new pede--we'd be the same in their minds as Twitter then.\nTrumanBlack has posts more than a month old???\nthis is the official trump form: https://defendyourballot.formstack.com/forms/incident_report?location=lawyerssitenav , you can verify that here: https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/11/defend-ballot-trump-campaign-webpage-report-election-issue-pass/\nElection media data (Edison) is NOT NECESSARILY the polling data (Dominion).\nHow do we know that the polling data isn't corrected (transformed) and it's just the media fucking up reporting?\nMultitudinous evidence of actual fraud on video and audio. Denial is a difficult stage in the stages of grief.\nStfu shill, we don't need low energy in here\nThe media calls the president these days. Havnt you heard? So their data must be tip top.\nIgnore the downvotes, you're right.\nWe ALL know there was fraud, but this is a broken dataset not suited for how it's being used. There are also super important questions being raised about the logic of the original script.\nEven THIS SCRIPT says that Biden would benefit from this more based on the \"dropped votes\" if you split them out per candidate. I and others believe these are just broken dataset anomalies.check my comment history for usernames of datapedes that agree this is misleading.\nThis should be unsticky'd IMMEDIATELY. Please spread the word pedes, this will make us look extremely bad.\nYou are totally right to think critically on this data. I'm in the same boat. If this is legit deleting and swapping votes to fix the election then its the biggest political scandal in world history. Given those stakes, it seems \"too easy\" that the evidence for that is in plain site for eagle eyed observers.\nTherefore, i'm thinking there is a reason for deleting votes? The Dominion manual says its a feature for if you accidentally run the same batch twice. That said, it does seem odd how many there are for NY and that some states have 0.\nI watched the Dr Shiva video that seems to demonstrate how and when the algorithm kicks in to switch votes. The next layer of this analysis is the timing. If Dr Shiva is right, I want to understand the times in which he sees votes in MI being flipped. That should match the data we see here. My gut is telling me it won't though because there is just one time interval in which MI votes were swapped and it should be much longer than that according to Dr. Shiva's analysis.\nnot the right link? site no worky\npost about this yesterday, bit.ly is censoring, link is correct, you can also click here: https://defendyourballot.formstack.com/forms/incident_report?location=lawyerssitenav , source: https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/11/defend-ballot-trump-campaign-webpage-report-election-issue-pass/\nDone\nMe too!\nTwo scoops!\nDo you want the typo as well?\nYes, That way I can authenticate it as mine so some leftist doesn't try to steal it.\nWhat’s ridiculous is that this, 4chan screenshots, etc. will absolutely be Library of Congress entries...provided the world doesn’t end...\nMe too!\n\"Ma!

Godspeed\nI sense glory upon us!\nYes siree bob\nThank you so much, patriot!\nSent to Veritas.\nDon't forget our Nephilim friend Bannon!\nSeconding Barris...If he gets a hold of this and believes it's legit, mountains will move.\nI posted it on his locals page too\n3rding Barris.\nLet’s remember this is an aggregate data feed from a third party company Edison research.\nThe question is if these issues in time series are caused by incorrect data entry during the night or by actual “vote theft”. Without looking at county-level time series it is not possible to tell.\nWhat's compelling about this is the SIZE of the vote change in Penn.- It's higher than California, Texas, New York, and Florida added together...in fact:\nTHE NUMBER OF VOTE CHANGES IN PENNSYLVANIA IS ALMOST LARGER THAN THE ALL OF THE REST OF THE COUNTRY COMBINED.\nPA was the crown and it’s no coincidence\nThe Keystone. As the elders of yore spake.\nVirginia is even higher than Pennsylvania for lost/switched votes as a percentage of total reported votes.\nWest Virginia and New York are high too.\nYou're correct, we don't have access to the time-stamp data at the county level. But a lawyer, with a fistful of data that is Public does. It might be enough to get a lookie-loo.\nIn any case, calculations here are outlandish. Million votes stolen from Trump by the voting machines, something which a simple recount would reveal? Impossible.\nDems stole this election by ballots harvesting, much more difficult to prove and undo unfortunately.\nIt is not impossible. The goal of the fraud was to make Trump concede. Biden would then claim victory and the truth would be lost in the transfer of power.\nBut Trump did not concede.\nIt's already been proven that these dominion voting machines have switched 6,000 votes from Trump to Biden in a single county in a single county in Michigan. And since this \"glitch\" has also happened in Wisconsin and Georgia. If this same \"glitch\" is happening in every county in MIchigan, it would equal about 280,000 votes which is slightly more than what Biden needed to win the state. Coincidence?\nThe lying MSM which has already reported this problem as a glitch and only happened on that one michigan machine in order to stop additional inquiry, now that multiple 'glitches' are now discovered, they changed their story to it being \"human error\". lol.\nSure, but then how do you explain why the numbers always go against Trump.\nSimple recount won't reveal if they then followed up with inserted paper ballots -- or intended to do so but then numbers became too great.\nI witnessed this during the early 2016 dem primaries, the glitch downward adjustments against Bernie during the live vote reporting, but I wasn't watching too closely to follow up with research.\nThe glitches are the \"order\" for fakes to be inserted. They can only order what can be supplied.\nHmm, did we find ourselves a few disinformation operatives in this thread? I think we did, but their downplaying was low-energy.\nYou know what to do, 'pedes.\nThis is not official results -- this is exit polling data. From Edison's web site:\nwww.edisonresearch.com/election-polling\nAs we all know, the polling has been really bad, both in 2016 and in 2020. None of us have access to official state voting data right now, and anyone who says they do is lying.\nThis is not exit polling data. They also report the official poll data which is what this data set purportedly is. Here is info from NBC which says they get their election data from Edison/NEP.\nThat said. Nothing about Edison is official. Any mistakes they make in their reporting are not \"official\" and all analysis of the data set is subject to their garbage/glitches in addition to the state vote data.\nRegardless of whether this is exit polling data OR some kind of vote vote feed, THIS is the data that \"official sources\" are using to call the election.\nGet it?\nyoure glowing\nYeah, I'm not really impressed with this. It's a start but not really that informative.\nIt's exit polling data! Why is no one talking about this? Go to Edison Research's website, they are a marketing firm that does nationwide exit polling.\nI went to their website. They very clearly offer a real time vote counting service in addition to exit polling. Not sure if you're blind or shilling.\ntits or gtfo\nMessage Laura Baris, Rich's wife too. It looks like she reads responses more often.\nhttps://twitter.com/LauraBaris\nGood thinking! I know Rich must be swamped right now. @LauraBaris\nAnd add @TracyBeanz because the Flynn's like her.\nElection Wizard\nSPREAD EVERYWHERE.\nKamala never stopped\nYeah send to willie brown too\nI just LOL'ed\nshe fucked Her way to the top\nBeen spamming him constantly. Got in immediately after one if his posts too. Twitter puts us all under \"more replies\", even if we're the only reply. Its infuriating.\nSounds like a good parody cover for The Who\nNot to be confused with electric wizard\nJames Woods! That dudes a damn genius!!!\nLiterally\nAnd has an enormous penis\nCan't confirm, but upvoting for the positive mental image\nHe singlehandedly skewed the \"average\" penis size so now all the lefties feels like they have small dicks.\nScott Presler, good dude and funny as hell.\nAngelic hair too\nI hope I can achieve near his hair length by next year into Trump's second term!\nposted it to a locals for the second person on this list...we will see if it get's approved\nNow, can you run that script on senate races???\nin before we realize POTUS goes into his 2nd term with 72 senators\nI truly love every one of you and continually am praying and fasting for all of you and our victory.\nPraying is the most important thing you can do right now. Second is spreading this to everyone.\nPraying is definitely not THE most important. If everybody did nothing about this except for pray, we wouldn't have ANY of this data or evidence.\nGathering evidence to build a case is THE most important thing right now.\nYou won't suddenly be bestowed a bulletproof case, God doesn't work like that.\nWE have to put in the time and effort, then pray all will be revealed and America will be saved. Prayer is good, but don't use it as an excuse to get complacent.\nGod wants to help us. But he also wants us to use the tools he gave us\nPraying is always the most IMPORTANT thing you can do, however right now it may not necessarily be the FIRST thing that you should do.\nAgree. I have spiritual gifts and am fasting and praying for us. I'm doing my part.\nI think he means praying is the most important you can do while not actively doing anything, if that makes sense.\nLove you too! :D\nAnd a GOP controlled House?\nCUT ALL THE TAXES! ROLL BACK ALL THE REGULATIONS! CUT AL THE FOREIGN SPENDING! DRILL ALL THE OIL! REPEAL ALL THE ACA! DISBAND ALL THE ALPHABET AGENCIES AND END THE FED!\nOmg I have so many more. THIS IS MAGA COUNTRY!!!\nEVERY COUNTY IN CA IS ACTUALLY RED!!\nAccording to OP?\nNope, just voicing my desires with parent OP. But I bet with only citizens voting with ID it would be likely.\nNumber one should be FAIR ELECTIONS. Purge all voter rolls, ban non military absentee voting, mandatory voter id, paper ballots, mandatory auditing.\nIf the votes were counted fairly democrats would never have a majority again.\nI just came.\nI came.\nNext: you only get to vote if you are a net contributor, tax-wise. Remove income tax for all government employees and adjust salaries accordingly (drop the charade of \"they contribute, too!\").\nWhy should the people being paid to do the job get to vote themselves in and tell themselves how they get to do it?\nDAS RAAAYYYCIIIIISSSSSS, though! According to libtard anti-logic.\nWhite liberals know in thier hearts that blacks are ignorant and incapable, they must be led to and hand-fed everything. They NEED the guiding hand of the rich white liberal to show them the way. Quite insulting, and utterly racist.\nThey've been cheating for years. CA is probably red. MN is red.\nNot sure about MN. That state has put the “R” in retard since the 70s.\nVoting verified by blockchain. We need a completely trust-less and decentralized environment. Not owned and built by a Clinton Foundation benefactor. One that you can independently verify that your vote went to the right person and got counted.\nThis guy fucks, Freedom Boner Intensifies\nYou know we could throw the democrats a bone and increase the size of the SCOTUS like they want, with 4 more Trump appointments.\nWhile I understand your only making a joke...I want to point out how dangerous that would be. You appoint 4 new SCOTUS's and then the next election the democrats get elected nd now the precedent has been set.\nNo thank you. I value our Constitution and whole heartedly reject all fuckery, from either side of the aisle.\nSoon everyone is a supreme court justice!\nMy point is that if we can do it, they can. If both sides can do it, the constitution needs to be amended to fix that. Might as well change the law to \"13 justices\" while fixing the constitution at the same time so the number can not be increased without constitutional amendment.\nThis is an important viewpoint to keep in mind as we go into the close: remember the pedes that use cannabis. It's not talked about here much which is worrying. Repubs are all about states rights until they focus on something they disagree with, then they go full Dem on them. States rights are a crucially important part of our constitution and can't be ignored because it's inconvenient for you.\nSure roll back the national mandates on abortion and drug control, but be ready to lose the battle anyways in the blue states, just like the founding fathers intended.\nBe the Lion party, not the Republican party.\nDrugs sure, abortion no. Protecting babies from being murdered is different than a dude sitting on his couch smoking a joint with a bag of Cheetos.\nIm still not down with other-than-prescription drugs, but if I have to choose between making those go away and saving babies’ lives, we would have another baby boom.\nThat's just your opinion. One I agree with, but still. Letifs ts will go Healthcare is a right. It's totally different than protecting a dude sitting on his couch smoking a joint with a bag of Cheetos. People die without it. Just like these babies. Will you be pushing for universal healthcare or are you a hypocrite?\nIs abortion in the constitution? It's a not a new phenomenon.\nHere's what you do, you vote it down in your state, and only your state, and you stay fuck out of federal laws. Then you make everyone else do the same. Then you go to a state with the laws you like and settle down there, while the aborters can go to their state. If all 50 states outlaw it individually then hell yeah, otherwise tough shit.\nLEGALIZE ALL THE WEED\nWegalize all the Leed!\nIs there any question that the war on drugs has been an abysmal multi trillion dollar failure?\nWe have no choice but to try something different. People should be free to do what they want as long as other citizens don’t have to pay for their mistakes like becoming a drug addict.\n\"As long as other citizens don't have to pay...\"\nWell, they do. In every state that has legalized it, we pay for losers mistakes.\nOff topic to data thread but to straighten things out for you.\nRepublican Redpills to the answers you seek:\nAll controlled substances should be by prescription; with alcohol (and maybe tobacco depending on State/local ordinances), being dispensed via the usual methods (but the licensing etc. can be simplified to follow the prescription model), and all others through (real) pharmacies.\nEventually, all prescription drugs (likely except addictive substances), will be covered(paid zero direct price) with a Republican Strict-Constitutional version which is 180 degrees opposite of 44NoCare or Single-payer leftie crap. Also includes drug treatment programs.\nFor law enforcement activities, If it's drugs, it should be D.E.A. not the FBI, and DEA should be moved from DOJ, to FDA and HHS. Same with A.T.F. should have the F removed, and A.T. moved with D.E.A. and to HHS.\nDon't be trying to split the Republican Party. DJT is the political head of the Republican Party. He studied and the whole 3rd party thing many times, and he made the choice and decision it was best to vote and JOIN the REPUBLICAN PARTY. MAGA DJT shortened from *\"Let's Make America Great Again!\" - Ronald Reagan's campaign.\nMAGA! And back to our Data thread, which I wish people & Pedes would take the redpills on, from those of us whom have been through this rodeo before.\nAmericans aren't going to roll over on what they want just because you come at them with some strong language. We wouldn't have Trump in office now if it worked like that.\nMy right to use cannabis to medically help myself is just as crucial to me as your gun rights. My ability to use it not medically is as important to me as your free speech rights and entertainment rights. All have to do with liberty. You're just suppressing it at that point. Law enforcement agencies? The ones that regularly bust your average Joe in legal states, just so they can re-up on their slush funds? Those guys that turn aroun, literally when BLM attacks. The ones that take your guns? you want me to trust law enforcement. That's RINO thinking. Fittingly, since your bold plan is \"change nothing.\"\nControlled substances are just another way for the government to take control over you. \"Leave alcohol out\" said the incredible hypocrite. One of the most harmful, addictive, life-destroying substances out there. \"But it's fine cause my beers, MAGA!\" as he jiggles his hard won belly into an early grave. Those damn cannabis-users and their cheetos though, amirite?\nYou don't even touch upon the huge issue of whether or not it should be a controlled substance to begin with. \"All controlled substance should be prescription\" Except alcohol. Again. I''m not even sure how to engage such a warped idea. It's entirely double think from start to finish, covered up by brazenly invoking Donald Trump's name as if that makes your argument less faulty.\nWhere are you getting this info from? You've completely killed by MAGA boner and you could see from my months of posts it was the most raging hard-on before this.\nSo I'd like to confirm that this is Trump's plan for myself. Your sources?\n\"Back in 1990 at a luncheon held by the Miami Herald, Trump called the United States’ drug enforcement policy a ‘joke’ and was quoted as saying “We’re losing badly the war on drugs. You have to legalize drugs to win that war. You have to take the profit away from these drug czars.'\"\nIn a leaked recording from 2018, Trump was heard to say marijuana makes people “lose IQ points” and at an opioid summit that same year at the White House, Trump advocated the death penalty for drug dealers, equating the provision of lethal drugs with murder. He was quoted as saying “Some countries have a very, very tough penalty — the ultimate penalty — and by the way, they have much less of a drug problem than we do”.\nWow, so is Trump going to legalize everything or turn us into North Korea? Kill the drug dealers, hang them from the street corners?\nTrump vs Trump who's right?\nBetter if he had 69 lmao\nNice.\nNiiiicce\nJazz Club!\n68...It means you do me and I owe ya one\n77 69 and I get 8 more\nI'd shit down both legs.\nHouse races.!!!!\nI'm sure we won the House and I want it. The American people voted to give President Trump his mandate and a way to accomplish it. We won the House.\nSupermajority goes brrrrrt.\nYou have 1150 Brts to play with Pede..\nBrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt! Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrttttrrrrrrrrrttttttttt!\nIs that an A10 Warthog in your pocket!\nThat would be great. I'd love to see some of these squad thrown out on their asses.\nWinning the house means we can pass national blockchain for all future elections.\nLets start with national 2nd amendment. Then we can go into vote blockchains.\nIdk, right now I’m feeling that we are one election fraud away from no 2nd. At least we all have the chance to go scuba diving to look for our long lost guns and ammo that fell overboard. There are no do overs from full commie.\nSo invest in scuba gear.. got it!!\nAbsolutely! Segwit wallet with one satoshi in it. You could do a decentralized election for 330 million votes for about $58,000\nThe 2nd amendment makes all gun laws illegal. We don't need the house for that, the supreme court could declare it tomorrow.\nThis is why BIDEN is dangerous. Packing the court and no #2A\nWhy not both.\nBecause!!! No reason not to!\nNo technology that can’t be verified by a 5th grader honestly. Just leaves elections more vulnerable to fraud. Just use paper ballots and voter ID and ink on fingers.\n👆👆👆 This.\nPlease run one on the Michigan senate race. We need to see how the votes were manipulated compared to the senate race. Peters had way less votes than Biden and James had way more votes than Trump. Switching votes from Trump to Biden would give us this result. If you can match the time the switches happen with a graph, we are golden.\nJohn James needs that seat because ARMY AVIATION ALL THE WAY!\nAhem, but yeah, he seems a good dude and a worthy man to put in the seat.\nHappy Veteran's Day, lad!\nCan we go back to 2018 and run it. Sorry I'm like a like a special Olympian in the real Olympics when it comes to being a computer athlete.\nDon't worry pede, that's most of us here. Our job is to spread the info.\nMy thought as well. How many HOUSE races did they flip with this?\nNot enough – we are going to take it!\nTwitter fucking deleted our followers, suspended our account, and unfollowed us from everyone we were following last night for tweeting out a meme about their censorship. We don't know when we'll be back but we'll blast it out to our 0 followers asap. @electionwatch13\nYou have now joined an elite club.\nThey did the same to mine. In their defense, I did have a Patriot Lion as my icon patch, The Constitution, bullets and Flag as my header pic and spelled out my alliegence veeeery clearly in my bio.\nMine was a kenosha kid meme, and 2020meme war banner. But I verified my phone number 4-5 times. I stand by everyword.\nSame here. Small fry and being somewhat careful on what I redpill with. Locked account under review\nalso each state GOP leader\nCan someone tell me why in the fuck they are using two or three decimal places of precision to multiply 6 digit numbers then telling us we're within less that for margins?\nAnyone else seeing this? Are they really moving votes around by simple ratios?\nWhat on the gluten-free fuck is going on here?\nConsidering this system is funded or affiliated with CLinton Foundation, there's your answer. It appears they programmed it to send .6% percent of the votes to the Dem candidate. Biden's just a name/placeholder. In 4 years it'll be someone else. BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD U/PEDEINSPECTOR\nDid he look at the softwares source code? how did he get it?\nJSON data that is used to populate the nyt's election map. They get it from the same place a lot of news outlets get it from.\nThis though just makes this a display error and not a vote tabulation error. The news gets the vote count to 3 significant figures but that doesnt mean the underlying votes are stored to 3 significant figures\nActually if you watch Dr Shiva's video today, they do in fact store votes as decimal numbers. The voting machines allow \"weighted voting\" as a feature so you can allocate votes as 2.0 to 0.5 between the candidates. It's in there by design. He had official data from previous elections showing totals that were fractional. It's absurd.\nI saw the video, the problem is Edison is only reporting the percentage to 3 decimal places, but the vote totals are in the millions. If we want to convert the decimal to integers accurately we would need the percent to 7 decimal places\nDr. Shiva's presentation shows they're stored as double-precision floats though, not 3-digit decimals.\nDoubles can store every exact positive integer up to 2^53 before they start jumping in larger amounts...and they can similarly store percentages to way beyond the precision necessary to get exact vote totals (after rounding) from each candidate based on percentage of the total vote.\nThe underlying data type shown in Dr. Shiva's presentation is more than sufficient for perfect precision, but it's still suspicious that it's used at all. A simple and correct voting machine would just use 32-bit or 64-bit integer accumulators (the latter for future-proofing against worldwide elections...shudder). The only reason to use a double seems to be to support the [should-be-illegal] ratio-based voting feature in the laziest possible way (too lazy to ever convert back to integer totals for storage).\nIf the underlying data the fake news orgs is using can be called into question, so can this coronation.\nWell, so this is an aggregate data piblished by edison research. It does show that Trump lost votes between timeseries 187 and 188.\nProblem here is that being aggregate, state-wide data, it is possible that there were data entry issues or corrections published.\nTo actually prove any “vote theft” we would need to look at county level/precints data, and confirm it with manual recount.\nFor instance, gateway pundit claimed based on similar calculatuons that votes were stolen in Rock County.\nHowever, Rock County officials dismissed this as “data issue” by the data provider.\nhttps://www.beloitdailynews.com/news/local-news/rock-county-clerk-disputes-accusation-of-vote-tampering/article_d31eb04b-4fbc-5acc-91a5-4e3cb0b70978.html\nThen why is it always the third decimal amount?\nWhat’s your point exactly? This is an aggregate state level time series, it does show drop in Trump votes, however that can be just a data entry.\nI don’t expect recounts will suddenly reveal hundreds of thousands of Trump votes stolen by voting machines. I would be happy if Georgia goes red after the recount, even that would be a huge success.\nIf it was simply data entry, than some Biden votes would be flipped to Trump as well. This is ONLY happening with Trump votes being switched to Biden votes - how is that just a data entry issue?\nhave you looked at the script yourself? it seems that it only calculates lost votes for Trump\ndef findfraud(NAME): with open(NAME + '.json', encoding=\"utf8\") as f: x = json.load(f) TotalVotesLost = 0 for i in range(len(x[\"data\"][\"races\"][0][\"timeseries\"])): if i != 0 and x[\"data\"][\"races\"][0][\"timeseries\"][i][\"votes\"] * x[\"data\"][\"races\"][0][\"timeseries\"][i][\"vote_shares\"][\"trumpd\"] < x[\"data\"][\"races\"][0][\"timeseries\"][i-1][\"votes\"] * x[\"data\"][\"races\"][0][\"timeseries\"][i-1][\"vote_shares\"][\"trumpd\"]: if x[\"data\"][\"races\"][0][\"timeseries\"][i][\"votes\"] * x[\"data\"][\"races\"][0][\"timeseries\"][i][\"vote_shares\"][\"bidenj\"] > x[\"data\"][\"races\"][0][\"timeseries\"][i-1][\"votes\"] * x[\"data\"][\"races\"][0][\"timeseries\"][i-1][\"vote_shares\"][\"bidenj\"]: print (\"Index : \" + str(i) + \" Past Index : \" + str(i-1)) print (x[\"data\"][\"races\"][0][\"timeseries\"][i][\"votes\"] * x[\"data\"][\"races\"][0][\"timeseries\"][i][\"vote_shares\"][\"trumpd\"] - x[\"data\"][\"races\"][0][\"timeseries\"][i-1][\"votes\"] * x[\"data\"][\"races\"][0][\"timeseries\"][i-1][\"vote_shares\"][\"trumpd\"]) TotalVotesLost += x[\"data\"][\"races\"][0][\"timeseries\"][i][\"votes\"] * x[\"data\"][\"races\"][0][\"timeseries\"][i][\"vote_shares\"][\"trumpd\"] - x[\"data\"][\"races\"][0][\"timeseries\"][i-1][\"votes\"] * x[\"data\"][\"races\"][0][\"timeseries\"][i-1][\"vote_shares\"][\"trumpd\"] print (str(str(TotalVotesLost) + \" Flo\"))\nThis isn't only happening with Trump to Biden votes. Check it out yourself, I was looking through Wisconsin the other day trying to catch fraud and in fact Biden lost significantly more votes than Trump did in that state.\nIt's garbage data.\nCope harder, Biden boy.\nGet out shill\nReally just pure coincidence then that all these \"data issues\" only benefit Biden 😂👍\nLook at the script, it's programmed that way.\nIt just finds the differences, and they never benefit Trump. The code isn't biased.\nIs it looking at ALL differences and they never benefit Trump, or is it looking for only the differences that favor Biden and we don't know if any favored Trump?\nThanks!\nNothing to see here, move along fellow raci-- I mean, millipede.\nDo we know that they only benefit Biden? I'm not seeing a number of votes that switched FROM Biden TO Trump, and I don't know if it's because there were none, or because no one has looked.\nThere's no way in hell that true \"glitches\" only favor Democrats, even if that's what history shows...\nCorrect, it's deliberate fraud, not a bug. The algorithm they were using has been reverse engineered.\nAre you just concern trolling? This is the map of fraud. That data comes from vote tabulating machines and they keep a timestamped record of their counts. Lawyers will use this map to file discovery to seize those machines' logs and we'll see how they match. Maybe there's a consolidation or reporting error here or there in the database but this many isn't feasible as a collection of one-off errors. And it also shows how votes can be skimmed between states, and it spot-checks with ground observers and news reports. Elections have been overturned on less. This is the map.\nNice try, disinfo agent. This is what it actually says on Edison's site: \"A proven source for accurate and timely nationwide vote tabulation:\nIn an effort to improve quality, streamline data collection, and expand election coverage in 2018, ABC News, CBS News, CNN and NBC News ended their arrangement with the Associated Press for vote tabulation and now partner with Edison Research for these data.\nFor the 2018 General Election, Edison Research provided the NEP with a fast and accurate vote count throughout the nation, providing data for all statewide races and all House races.\"\nTabulation is counting. Everybody has access to official data right now because it's POSTED ON THE COUNTY ELECTION WEBSITES OF EVERY COUNTY, Edison just aggregates it.\nDeport this guy.\nYep deport u/lapdants. His concern trolling all throughout this thread. They're getting scared.\nI just did a search. The .json file has a field called edison_exit_polls_page pointing to a web URL, but it's mixed in with other random web URL's. They have more references to tabulation, e.g. \"Released as a separate subtotal at the end of tabulation\" shows up a couple times, and a third with an abbreviation.\nThis doesn't appear to be exit poll data. It appears to be actual tabulated data, albeit presented in a lossy 3 significant figure format.\nWe need to be really careful with drawing inferences about dropped/switched votes from calculating Trump/Biden votes from percentages with only 3 significant figures, because anything beyond those figures is basically going to be random noise from timestamp to timestamp.\nI suspect the OP's calculations for switched votes are bunk because of this unless he took it into account and gave the \"minimum possible swing\" or something, but there are still some major abnormalities in the data. The OP pointed one of them out too: There's a 0.6% drop in Trump votes, or 6 ticks of the least sig fig, when the vote total jumped by only 54 from 2984468 to 2984522...that's way outside of rounding error.\nThe data the OP used comes from NY Times data feed which itself was provided by Edison research.\nThis is a time series, state-aggregated data.\nDo you really believe a recount in PA will reveal a million extra Trump votes stolen by voting machines?\nYes.\nYep, what we are seeing here is the final approved for release version of the data, which is already rigged by the algorithm. However that 1M vanished votes come from mathematically, it's a product of data tempering of historic proportions.\nif that was the case a simple recount would fix this. does not seem to be a smart move on Dems side.\n4 years ago I would not. Look at your behaviour lately and tell me again how you're not capable of this.\nBehavior.*\nCalm down. A random guy uses NY times data series to claim 1 million votes were stolen from trump by voting machines and I am the crazy one here?\nThe fraud was done by ballot harvesting and ballot drops at night.\nThis is EXIT POLLING. Straight from Edison Research:\nThis is not official vote tallies and people are acting incredibly responsibly in this thread.\nthey say they interview over 100,000 voters, not millions of voters.. so how do they get millions in the election data counts? Are you implying that these are running estimate of votes that are extrapolated from 100K exit interviews and that they keep adjusting on the fly?... and that they were interviewing shadowy voters in Detroit and Philly at 4 and 5am? Maybe they interviewed a few thousand in the dark of night to get to 138,000 Biden votes and 0 Trump votes?\nlapdants is a shill. Deport.\nYes, that's exactly what he's implying.\nThese shills don't realize they're talking to people that can think. They're used to conversations with lobotomized leftists.\nDeboonker go deeeeenoooooonk\nhe was banned?\nWell he shows up for me\nHmmm maybe he deleted his account to be safe? Weird.\nHes still here https://thedonald.win/u/PedeInspector/\nI think the site was down. I doubt someone would go to so much verifiable trouble only to bail.\nAgree\nSo like...the money scam they pulled on Office Space but this time with votes instead of pennies?\nThe fuckers who did this better not get a minimum security prison with conjugal visits.\nNo no. I see Federal-Pound-Them-In-The-Ass prison in their futures.\n\"Mother shitter! Son of an ass!\"\n\"Peter! Watch out for your cornhole, dude!\"\ni bet they got the idea from Office Space 😂\nWouldn't surprise me - the idea of going after Flynn with the Logan act came from Law and Order.\nThought it was West Wing?\nI don't watch any network tv and couldn't remember, so I guessed. I was hoping someone knew - thanks!\nI've never seen Law and Order or West Wing. I only know about it because Bongino talked about it sometime in the summer.\nWhen I saw the vertical lines in Biden's totals, I knew someone screwed up. That was too obvious. One possibility is that they programmed it to transfer votes over time, but they forgot to account for pauses in the counting. So for the hours when they stopped counting, the fraud software didn't. They couldn't admit the software was flawed, that would trigger an investigation. They couldn't repudiate the votes, they needed them for Biden to win. The only thing they could do was try to bluff their way through and hope their propaganda machine could cover them.\nBest theory yet.\nThey need some time in federal pound me in the ass penitentiary\nThis is the best analogy to share with normies to understand what has happened here.. Everyone has seen office space and knows that scene about shaving pennies.\nSo you’re stealing.\nyes\nFractional voting has stolen elections for years\nWatch this shit catch on in other countries. Many governments' sloppy frauds will be resurfacing like floating turds\nEvidently my country uses dominion counting machines. now im concerned\nIf the electoral data gets purged in the coming days, you know what's up\nWould be very interesting to see full independent audits worldwide\nHow many elected officials in this country weren't actually elected...\nThe importance of this needs to be stated. You can't fucking have 0.88 votes. That's bullshit and they use it to steal elections.\nI really hope it's the data provider being retarded, and this isn't how we tabulate elections.\nSeeing that the Antrim county glitch can be found in the data, it is basically guaranteed that the data matches the real numbers.\nWhere did you get that snippet of code? Is that from the dominion voting machines? some website?\nVoting machines need open source code and all output needs to be public knowledge. Full crazy level auditing the processing code\nIts impossible the vote_share is not precise enough, you cant get a raw vote with the percentage to only 3 significant figures\nIt's not exit polling data, you can find glitches from videos with this data too, if you see a glitch live on CNN, you can find it in this data.\nYou only have the 3 decimal places for vote share which is not precise enough to find errors on the order of thousands in the data you posted. You need more significant digits for vote_share otherwise you are generating precision out of thin air\nBtw, did you perform the reverse experiment where we can see potentially how many votes switched from Trump to Biden (and not just vice versa). Please tell me you checked this.\nIn this day and age our voting software should be open-source and available to skim through on GIT...\n-__-\nEXACTLY.\nIt is how they tabulate elections. The system is programmed to swing Dem\nHey sorry, retard here. Whats up with the decimal place thing? I've seen it around a fair amount recently. And what is being multiplied?\nhttp://blackboxvoting.org/fraction-magic-1/ this website explains it all. It also explains how they fuckin cheat elections with it.\nWow this is crazy. I knew the voting systems were corruptible but to see it laid out this way is eye opening.\nCongratulations. Welcome to 2 decades ago.\nYeah, it's pretty apparent that he just \"beat the cheating\" in 2016, because they believed their BS polls too much to go \"all out\" like they did this year. Even this year they still underestimated the amount of mail-in ballots to fake in advance, and they were only able to cover the difference with a ton of egregious last-minute panic cheating, which was too obvious to go unpunished.\nHOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!! RED ALERT!!\nThis explains everything!\nDoes anyone know if fractional voting and weighted voting is being used? The article says it could be and no one would know.\nWow, thats fucking slimee as shit\nThe data set, instead of having the vote counts for each candidate, has a total number of votes and a fraction for each candidate.\nIt looks roughly like this: votes: 1234567 biden: 0.654 trump: 0.321\nWhen you're dealing with a 6 or 7 digit number and multiply by a 3 digit decimal, precision is lost; you don't know exactly how many votes go for each candidate.\nLooking at the fake example above, 0.001 of 1,234,567 is 1,235.\nBiden's actual vote count could be anywhere between 807,406 and 808,641.\nTrump's actual vote count could be anywhere between 396,296 and 397,530.\nGotcha, so basically in tight races coming down to a 0.1 point margin the actual results could be different from the reported results.\nIn general terms, it would seem this is not the most accurate way to count, nor is it the easiest since it requires the candidate votes divided by total votes, rounded to the nearest 0.1%. All while they could do the easier and more accurate thing by reporting the unprocessed raw counts.\nIn your example it looks like the last sigfig is the thousands place and we don’t actually know how many hundreds went to either candidate.\nThank you for this. It makes more sense now. I wasn’t sure how they were going from 3 decimal places can equate to 1 or 2 votes to thousands.\nIn https://i.maga.host/RNPN3Oz.png, the total number of votes counted in Pennsylvania increased by 54 between 4:07 AM and 4:08 AM. This is a 0.002 percent increase in total votes counted (54 / 2,984,468 * 100). But the vote share for Biden increased by 0.6 percentage points. This means that Trump lost a large number of votes.\nWithin the precision that we have, we can say that the vote share for Biden increased by somewhere between 0.55 and 0.65 percentage points. We can therefore conclude that Trump lost somewhere between 16,415 and 19,399 votes in this example. (For simplicity, I am ignoring the 31 votes that he would have expected to gain of the 54 that came in.)\nThis is the kind of attention to detail we need. Good job.\nOP did tell one lie. This is not a nuke, this is the MOTHER OF ALL NUKES.\nOh shit it gets even better. Dr Shiva Ayyadurai is crunching these numbers too and they've more or less reverse engineered the math they used to siphon votes. This is going to blow up HUGE.\nThis ain't a MOAB, we're getting into Tsar Bomba territory here.\nEDIT: I'm not sure how to embed a periscope link, but here's his twitter feed that has it all: https://twitter.com/va_shiva?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Eembeddedtimeline%7Ctwterm%5Eprofile%3Ava_shiva&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fvashiva.com%2Fdr-shiva-live-election-fraud-in-massachusetts%2F\nIt looks like they had a system set up to siphon trump votes in districts with greater than 25% trump turnout. The idiots didn't even vary it up, used same math on all cheated counts. Its consistant.\nI pray for this. One big nuke that just overturns several states in one go and lands people in front of congress and then in jail.\nThis isn't \"in front of congress stuff\". This is insurrection act, thrown in jail immediately crap.\nAs if anyone with the authority to do that actually has the balls to see it done.\nThere are several layers of fraud here. The voting machines are only one.\nu/DCdeporable did an infographic on this just now. This guy (Dr. Ayyadurai) is an MIT PhD, this is huge.\nhttps://thedonald.win/p/11Q8O2y2SY/\nI made a genuine attempt to understand this, but I'm not PhD-level smart. ELI5 anyone?\nFor fuck's sake, what smarter pede than I has sent the code and results and here findings to Trump Campaign and the ilk of patriots 'round the social medes?\nAnyone else having trouble viewing that stream? I've got it small and on on a good connection and it won't play for more than a few seconds before stalling indefinitely.\nIt's on Dr. Shiva's youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztu5Y5obWPk&feature=emb_title\nThe video is incredibly concise and easy to understand. The evidence is damning.\nScrew it, as long as it works. Plus the swamp is hosting facts that will kill their candidate, guess I'll take glee in that.\nMoney link, thanks.\nThat’s called an unintentional TD.win DDOS.\nI have downloaded the entire video. It's 1.5GB, so Streamable won't take it. But for users that have\nffmpeg, you can grab just about any streaming social media video from the internet by using its .m3u8 playlist file.\nFor example, in Firefox, if you open his Periscope video, which is the source for the clip on twitter, and then right click it and inspect it, you can find this file.\nRight click on video > inspect > Network Tab > Click Reload> then at the top type m3u8 to filter it down.\nClick on that m3u8 line and it will open the the url for the m3u8 file.\nNow, with ffmpeg, you can grab the entire video to archive, share, watch or whatever. For linux, the ffmpeg command and link for this particular clip is\nffmpeg -i \"https://canary-video-us-east-1.pscp.tv/Transcoding/v1/hls/rKWyxg889j4JUHD0KEsyj0kl-HE9Vn8eFx8CZWu8Ccsja84cE-TdFDrN1iD5FKf3Mud0ppwygX71jDplylg7iw/non_transcode/us-east-1/periscope-replay-direct-prod-us-east-1-public/playlist_16841709147873874030.m3u8\" -c copy output.mkv\n\"All your bitstream are belong to us.\"\nNow that it's been reprocessed it's only about 400 mb\nPut it up on the Maga video hosting site so youtube can't take it down\nhttps://video.maga.host/\nIt's already there by someone named joe.biden.sniffs.children, so let it be written\nI didn't even think to re-encode it. Apparently that type of critical thinking is above my pay grade I guess!\nYoutube encodes videos and streams to a tighter compression after they sit for a bit. Now for 720p it shows a 286 MB vp9-codec video file or a 330 MB h.264. Put together with the 65 MB audio file and it's under 400 MB.\nIt's something you wouldn't notice unless you ran into it before. There's no noticeable difference to the viewer.\nSame here, absolutely no surprises that you can't watch it on twatter.\nThanks, saved it to watch later tonight.\nIf my tally is correct as the total stands right now its 542,178 votes that have been switched and 2,865,807 votes lost. This is the mother of all nukes.\nThe “MOAN”\nI'm moaning just thinking about it\nMight one say, a MOAB?\nNot strong enough. Tsar Bomba!!\nCan anyone confirm this data has been sent? It would give a lot of us nonsmartcoding pedes peace of mind.\nThis data does appear on the nytimes site - you can still access it. What is unclear to me is how Edison obtains this data and if all the vote reversals are \"glitches\" like the Antrim county one or maybe some happen for other reasons. The fact that the Antrim glitch has been identified does make it seem very real. Hoping some pedes running the script will verify the Oakland county glitch is well.\nEdison Research also does vote counts so what is your point?\n“Vote Count The NEP provides media organizations with real-time vote results in all 50 states for statewide races, ballot initiatives and House races. The NEP vote count from Edison Research is the only service continuously updated after Election Day. We track every vote until results are certified by all states. Vote count data is available for statewide results, vote by Congressional District, county vote data breakouts for statewide races, and all U.S. House races.”\nHis point is to try to blunt the impact through disinformation because he's a shill and that's his job. Your job is to push the deport button below his post ;)\nThese comments are just as ridiculous as reddit claiming no Trump supporters ever existed on their platform and t_d was therefore a Russian troll farm.\nWe're going to eventually get something wrong and then we'll discredit ourselves if every single contrary opinion is assumed to be malicious and is disregarded.\nOf course we need contrary opinions to figure out where we're wrong; you're absolutely right. But there are also disinfo agents who leap into action whenever something is found saying it's a nothingburger or wrong, typically by continuously re-posting an easily-verified-to-be-wrong statement - in this case \"it's exit polling data\" (it's the data that drives NYT's counter, they obviously use collected counts not exit polling). The difference is subtle and the point of downvotes and the deport button is they harness collective intelligence of many users to figure out whether it's one of the other, which the mods then use human judgement on. So if it seems like a dumb argument, push the downvote button; if you feel that the pattern of behavior is intentionally deceptive, push deport.\nyis. am also but a humble humanities pede.\nYou vill get banned if display truth on Tvitter.\nWe were suspended, our followers were deleted, and they removed our follows from everyone we were following last night for sharing a meme about twitter's censorship.....ironic, isn't it? @electionwatch13 if we ever make it back\nDear God,\ny u no make me smart like dis?\nThanks,\nMe\nhttps://thedonald.win/u/PedeInspector/ thank him\nu/PedeInspector - God bless you, Pede.\nu/PedeInspector - God bless you, Pede.

No offense btw just doing my job. Glad to have you here!\nDr Shiva has found similar per his twitter Ayyadurai Shiva\nThey should compare notes...\nTHANK YOU AND GOD BLESS!!!!\nOk, I just did the math, let me know if there is an error. The system shows a difference of 54 votes from the first tabulation to the second. However, in order for the vote ratio to change as the system shows, that would mean that Trump would have lost 17,876.57 votes and Biden gained 17,929.81 votes. But since there was only a 54 vote difference between the two tabulations it’s impossible for those ratios to change by 17,000 since 17,000 != 54.\nThank you!\nWorth noting\nProbably someone in a country that desperately wants Trump yo win because they are tired of all the wars our other presidents are starting.\nMaybe someone in middle east who has actually been paying attention to the incredible peace deals Team Trump are striking and who has seen the peaceful way Trump has decimated Iran and N. Korea.\nPossibly someone in a developed country tired of having China steal all their patents and undermine every other countries ability to win any sort of manufacturing business by using stolen technology, child labor, and no worker’s rights.\nA lot of non Americans are rooting for Trump because he is good for the whole non-commie world.\nAmen to this.\nLike taiwan\nThe good thing is that what he posted is 100 percent verifiable, since the data is online for everyone to download, and other programmer pedes are already working on it. The only outstanding issue is whether the vote switches identified are all the same in nature as the Antrim ones or if there were some other type of glitches that may have been data feed issues and not genuine vote switches.\nI wish we could narrow the issues to certain counties.\nThis\nso get someone to check his work and just be thankful until then\nu/PedeInspector did you upload the Edison data so we have a source copy in case there's any fuckery with anyone going in and getting to manually change the values? And THANK YOU!\nYep, it's all in that workupload link above, every single state.\nJust checking and maybe someone else asked it, but did you run the same test to see if Biden votes were switched to Trump? Is it possible the events were occurring both ways?\nUpvoted to solidify the truth\nThere were some switching from Biden to Trump, but it was overwhelmingly the opposite.\nThe math would be showing negative numbers if votes were switched to Trump.\nDewd... amazing\nDumb question, but you have sent this to everyone in the trump orbit, right? If you have I'm gonna need more popcorn\nI never doubted you! :)\nYou have changed the world.\nHave we checked for the opposite - Biden votes lost to Trump? Just to see if there is some randomness to it?\nYes but they are much smaller.\nYup saw he said that. We need to get the exact numbers.\nWe need to change \"glitch\" into \"fraud\" and we need the full data to show that.\nDeport!!! Concern troll!!!! Shill!!!! /s\nFuck, it is pretty bad at times lately.\nPedeInspector did answer that he saw in PA about 20,000 (vs 200,000 for Biden) go Trump's way. I asked him to check other states. It's important data.\nAbsolutely. I'm the biggest Trump fan their is but we need an honest count. Jesus that should go wo saying.\nThe framework upon which we hash out our differences should be fair and transparent to everyone. We can bicker and argue about politics all day long, but it’s the ballot box that ultimately determines the direction of our country.\nSo I’m with you, I want to see it all. There’s a reason that neither side really pushes for more secure voting, and it’s because they both want to retain the option to cheat. We need to uncover all of it.\nYou asked a valid question, that ADDS TO THE CASE. Anyone who did this might want plausible deniability and/or leave some reasonable doubt.\nTHE PROSECUTION MUST TAKE THIS INTO CONSIDERATION!\nExactly, any evidence that things were fucky in the counts just makes court cases stronger or increases the chance that republican led legislatures investigate.\nDon jr... is that really you;/-\nSorry, I'm not even American. Just a Canadian who dreams more and more of moving down there.

The voting software occasionally takes the vote total, and then calculates the percent of the vote for the opposition candidate to the third digit, and then drops the third digit, and give it to the preferred candidate? and redistributes?\nSo if there are 4,000,000 votes in and DJT has 51.7% of the vote that means he has 2,068,000 votes. It then shifts that .7% of the vote to Biden?\nSo now DJT has 2,040,000 votes with exactly 51% of the vote?\nDo this three or four times over the course of the night and hope no one notices the rounding error and you can shift a state at least 2% towards your favor.\nI'm guessing that they had this going in ALL STATE using this software and still lost several. As the Election Night went on, and it was clear they were losing the MUST WIN STATES that's when they stopped the count and disturbed the emergency Biden Only Ballots.\nTLDR: The Dem's were using\nLex Luthor'sThe Superman 3 plan to get rich off of banking rounding errors to steal the election. Only we turned out the vote so hard they had to manufacture extra ballots.\nIs that right?\nEdit: Office Space, Yes\nI equate it more to Office Space. They were stealing a fraction of a penny, but they fucked up; they either didn't carry a 1 or didn't count on the sheer volume of vote Trump was going to get. They got greedy.\nwasnt the bad guy in the movie \"Ghost\" doing that then Roadhouse found out but bad guy had Roadhouse killed by a weird looking black guy that also looked hispanic (kinda like Juan Williams) and tried to fuck G.I.

Well those are whole votes. I'm just talking about fractions of votes here, okay? But we do it from a much bigger tray, and we do it a couple million times.\nunderrated comment\nExactly what happened. Plus I'm sure they harvested ballots from registered individual that were very likely not to vote by running an algorithm to find them. These would have been mailed in on time and the only way to prove those fraudulent would be to find the voter and ask them if there result matches the way they voted. ( not likely).\nIt can be done. Take Republicans that haven't voted in the last 2 or 3 elections, knock at their door, ask if they voted this time. If they say no, they could be asked to testify.\nTrump's campaign has ground game, this can be done easily.\nAccording to the Detroit lawsuit they just added names to the voter registration roll and ran the ballots that came from god knows where through.\nAnd ran some ballots through the counter 50+ times. That was always the most common way to scam votes in Wayne County and it's what crazy plant lady discovered in 2016.\nDuring her recount, they had a tub of ballots that was supposed to have 500 and it only had like 36, as I recall. Because they'd turn them all through the optical scanner/tabulator dozens of times each.\nbig tech had way more to do with this than we realized. That is why Jack looked so unbelievably weird and smug at the congressional hearings.\nCheck out the Voter Integrity Project.\nThey're literally doing this.\nAnd they have phonebanks where they are calling people and asking them.

I'm not sure now actually\nWe need these numbers too. But I think this is the dam breaking.\nI was wondering about NY. This is above my pay grade and can barely understand the ramifications of all of these numbers. LOL\nThis is just incredible. Incredible work.\nIt also makes up most if not all of the popular vote difference. I haven’t totaled the amounts but we’re looking at a net impact of at least 4 million votes.\nHow are you counting \"lost votes\" ? Do we know how they're attributed?\nI assumed most if not all were “lost” from Trump’s tally, but I am not certain that is the case. OP (or his source) indicated there were instances where vote flips went the other way (from Biden to Trump) but they were tiny compared to the Trump to Biden flips.\nIt's my understanding they were lost as in disappeared from the board totally. So they went missing from both counts - vanishing into the ether.\nAs votes are wont to do. Obviously.\nSupreme Level Autist.\nSomeone get this pede some more vaccinations!

This MUST be stickied, and this MUST be delivered to the Trump team!\nThere's no reason meme/spice posts should be stickied over something like this.\nTrump was watching this in real time at the Eisenhower Building.\nExplain?\nSupposedly there is a SCIF there. He watched the flip. That's where he was during election night. All this other stuff is great, but he had them dead to rights as soon as the numbers started coming in. A SCIF is a surveillance network or something, it's just a theory though.\nA Senstive Compartmentalized Information Facility (SCIF) is just a room where Secret/Top Secret computers and the like are stored and used.\nYep.\nthere are multiple SCIFS at the white house. all of the top secret briefings are done in SCIFS.\nsource: i had a security clearance when i was active duty.\nHis war room was at Eisenhower Building.\nI don't think he can use the WH for election stuff.\nYep.\nThe counter to this argument is that there are SCIF's all over the white house and it's not really significant there is one in the room Trump watched the election results in.\nSo he was completely clueless and wasn't watching himself. Figured a tipline would save the election? War rooms are to monitor the election, that's where he had his at and believe it, this election was monitored.\nI never said any of that...\nIf he was caught using the WH for that he may have broken some laws I think.\nNaawwww... he's only been talking about this and the fraud magnet ballots for the last 6 months.\nPlus, he's ONLY the President after all...\nhe was in the SCIF watching the results come in. the theory is he was watching the changes happen with the data guys telling him what changed and when.\nNot confirmed\nHe used the building as his war room and dipped over there. He only needed to see a minute or two. You can confirm it was his war room and he went there for a bit by just doing a simple google search.\nThe situation room is inside of the White House, the supposed SCIF is inside the Eisenhower Building, (EEOB), which is right next to the White House.\nWhere is the proof that there is a SCIF inside EEOB? I’ve been in there, haven’t seen this type of a room. It could be hidden somewhere for sure, but I can’t imagine them squeezing something like this between those old walls.\nHis war room was set up at the Eisenhower. The voting machines were communicating online to each other to be able to implement the fixes wherever it was needed. The tools at his disposal are beyond our knowledge. DHS and MI were watching and could turn a closet into a center if they had to.\nVoting machines are not hooked up to the internet.\nAs horrific as it is, they actually are.\nThey are. CISA continues to deny it. This guy explains it all. Team made up of former 3 letter officials “discouraged” by what they saw going on in the former administration.\nSystem has no protections either. They were able to get into it within 3 minutes from one of the investigators cell phones in the parking lot.\nhttps://youtu.be/ficae6x1Q5A\nThis is the most definitive proof I’ve seen so far, the dead ppl will amount to only so much, Trump hinted at this with the retweet.\nHow can we ensure Trump's legal team gets this? Submitting it via a site or hotline, I don't trust they'll see it. Hope someone on here has direct connections to Trump's sons or team.\nThey are on this site. They will see it.\nIt's now the most upvoted post ever on this site\nIf the Mods don't keep this up I have to assume that this whole platform is to keep us in a zoo\nIt was said earlier since the Hitlary and Pedosta dumps.\nDDOS attack as soon as this comes up. It means they're scared of this.\nthere are no coincidences anymore\nNever were.\nAlways was.\nThat's just a coincidence that you said that right then\nThat wasn't the intent, so the coincidence doesn't exist. Never did.\nThere never was. Coincidence theorists are the worst.\nI noticed that too\ni think TD.win is just having trouble loading the thread cause it's grown so big tbh.\nNah, even with the first few comments in, this thread was not easily accessed.\nYep..\nExactly. Over the target!\nYes, it all makes sense now!\nStumpycake's comment needs to be higher up.\nFuck.. Biden is going to lose 1,5 million votes between the hacks and fraudulent mail ins.\nIt's not enough he needs to lose 5 million\nPopular vote doesn't matter\nHe knows. He’s making a point about the extent of the fraud.\nCorrect, Trump just needs to have 214,019 votes corrected for him to carry Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Yes, that includes +1 vote in all three of those states. 1.5 million in the right states is overkill, but a landslide victory nonetheless.\nLess. He's only down by 160k or so in michigan. 81k flipped will do it.\nIsn't that only half???\nYes, but it would be -80k for Biden, which then move to Trump up +80k. So the net difference is 160k.\nImagine Biden has 560k votes. And Trump has 400k votes. If Biden loses 80k, his new total is 480k. Then those 80k go Trump, and his new total is 480k. So a flip of 81k would put Trump over... idk if that makes sense\nIt does make sense.\nYou're right. My head is so fucked right now with so much information in it.\nFlip one from Biden to Trump and it’s a net 2 vote change, so it only takes half\nIt doesn’t but it fucks with the lefts narrative that the EC should be discarded in favor of the popular vote\nFucking hilarious if that happens\nAs long as California, New York, and Illinois exist, Republicans will never win the popular vote.\nOr rather as long as New York City, Chicago, Las Angeles, and San Francisco exist, Republicans will never win the popular vote.\nThese numbers show that it’s possible NY is a swing state!!\nRepubs literally just won the popular vote. It’ll never be publically acknowledged until election fraud is eliminated, which isn’t that fucking hard if you’re actually trying.\nTrump is going to teach them how to win ;)\nNot with that attitude\nWe don't actually know that though. We assume that the people that live there are all diehard blue, but how much of that reported blue is actually fake votes? We need to find out.\nIt doesn’t but at the same time what’s fair is fair.\nIt does this year.\nI don't know why people even bring it up. Its not the game. It does correlate, but it doesn't really matter -> like shots in a hockey game. If the winner was the team that took more shots, both teams would play the game very differently. Plenty of teams have won games or built strategies around giving up shots but not goals.\n*by \"people\", I mean both sides. Its a useless argument\nFor the record, I agree with you and u/AceOfTrumps. I would just love to get the popular vote also to shut these obnoxious fucks up.\nThis isn't hockey, this is an election and accurate reporting of votes will play a part in determining the culture of our country. Imagine the difference over the next 4 years between a 2nd term Trump that squeaks by versus one that he won by a huge landslide.\nAs determined by the EC votes\nchanging the rules changes how people participate, so while the pop vote may correlate, there are TONs of people on both sides who don't vote because they live in an area where it 'won't matter'\nThis is just in the servers. We don't know how many the counting machines swapped votes before the data was entered into the servers yet.\nWe'll never know how many the deranged libshit commies outright threw away.\nAnd fraudulantly filled out. It's crazy how well he did in spite of the obstruction.\nIt wouldn't have been so obvious if it wasn't a landslide for Trump. If it had been a close race nobody would have went back and looked. They have been doing this for years\nThe mass outpouring of love and support from our great nation to GEOTUS completely to them by surprise. They can’t comprehend it, because all of their politicians are so unlikeable. The level of voting Trump received was beyond their wildest nightmares.\nThis is just the swing state votes. Biden barely got 40M if you count all states.\nI need this to be proven, I win 2 grand if Joe gets <40% of the popular vote haha\nI don't think it can be proven because they can't prove all the fraud, like the thrown out ballots etc. But should be enough to flip the result.\nYes I feel that is how it will go. But as long as Trump manages to strut back in for a 2nd term and destroys the DNC I'm happy.\nThis 1,000 times over. It's the point I've been trying to get across to everyone saying that the popular vote doesn't matter. How do you think we'd be able to move forward as a society with a Trump victory that showed something like 105 million to 40 million as opposed to a 75 million to 70 million Trump victory?\nYes, Trump wins the presidency either way, but the 1st is important in sending a message to all our enemies, and making many people on our side realize that there's a lot more of us than any expected.\nThey's no way they're taking dead away from him.\nIt really is more like 15 million votes probably, it's just so highly unlikely that Biden didn't pull McCain like margins.\nWhen reading the code, I thought the same thing. Here's my improved code that checks for irregularities both ways: https://pastebin.com/SwXNmNbC It still shows massive irregularities that favor Biden in states like Pennsylvania, but lesser extremes in other states, and even a few where it favors trump.\nAt the very least something here is definitely suspect and warrants an investigation and manual recount.\nThe big question is how and where is Edison Research getting these numbers? Is Edison Research performing any additional calculations (like determining the percentages) or just reporting raw data?\nBecause there's so much data and the count is updated mostly every minute, sometimes even within seconds, there's no way this isn't automated. And since it's automated, somebody's system done fucked up and the answer is in the code. Furthermore, since the errors are persistent, that would suggest the data source itself is most likely suspect.\nGoing further down the rabbit hole... if the source is straight from the voter machines then they need to subpoena the shit out of these companies! I want to see the revision and check in logs, I want to see company emails and communications, everything. Either these companies run some shitty operation and didn't test the code well enough and don't deserve our tax dollars... Or what's even more likely is there's some goblins hiding in the code.\nCould you imagine if they released the code base for us to review? I'd use up some sick days and personally volunteer. This has always driven me crazy that the voting machines that WE THE TAXPAYERS are paying for are not available for audit. There is no fucking reason good enough for why the code integral to our functioning Republic is not open source. Especially for those States that are fully electronic (touchscreens) and don't have a paper trail. Allowing these voting machines to be a giant black box and you're just asking for vote fraud as it would be so easy to slip some shitty ::barf:: \"glitch\" in there to completely steal an election. Sadly it wouldn't be that hard for them to also cover their tracks and overwrite the code and hide enough of the evidence to maintain reasonable doubt either.\nTL;DR: AUDIT THE FUCKING VOTER MACHINES AND RELEASE IT TO THE PUBLIC! I WANNA SEE THE CODE!\nI'm going to say that I was skeptical, but looking through that data - it feels like a slot machine, or something. With the odds set to favor one side, I dunno. I'm going to say that I haven't dissected and studied this like others in here, but wtf? It's not right at all.\nWork computers, something like massive voter fraud is bound to happen eventually. Does anyone honestly think there aren't people or there that would hate Trump enough to put malicious vote switching code in?\nThose companies definitely need to have their source control repositories subpoenaed so that if vote stitching code exists our did exist at some point, that we could see when and who checked it in.\nWant there an update just before the elections? I suppose someone found make a build of the software outside of source control and put that in an update package to be sent to the machines just before elections and then just delete the code, but I have a feeling it's a more permanent feature built into the software.\nThe machines weren't supposed to have internet connectivity anyway, There's a reason for that, but from what I've read, those laws/rules probably went followed.\nOf course, do you think Antifa and BLM are sitting idle? They are cheating as much as possible.\nIf you haven't seen this, check it out.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ficae6x1Q5A&feature=youtu.be&t=145\nApparently, you're grandmother's old desktop that runs windows xp is more secure than our election system.\nStill got mine. Love it.\nI hear you. But open source would mean EVERYBODY in the WORLD could access the code. Not sure that would pass security checks. I hear one of these companies is partly owned by the Clintons or some shit like that. All these machines should be able to be audited, as you say, but by some brilliant people on BOTH sides of the aisle, each sworn to secrecy, etc. Personally, I say count the paper ballots by hand, one by one. You put this shit in the cloud, this is what you get.\nNo. Sorry, but \"security by obscurity\" is absolute garbage, and has been a laughing stock in InfoSec circles for years.\nDO release the code. Believe it or not, a the level of security only raises when crowdsourcing the code, as countless independents will audit it and try to find vulnerabilities.\nOn the other hand, states like the CCP run actual, costly operations, but usually manage to obtain such code from private companies - in Dominion case, it has deep ties to the Clintons, a deeply corrupted party to begin with.\nOf course, paper is still the best.\nI do see your point. Kinda like Linux, right? It's out there, but it's pretty secure. This site is probably running on it.\nCough cough IE6 lock in cough cough. I still can't believe MS had a team that couldn't even write an HTML 4 parser.\nMore transparent yes. However I do not regard open source systems as necessarily more secure. E.g. Shellshock bug, very nasty one, was around since the 80s and discovered in 2014. Windows systems had their fair share of ugly bugs and so did Linux.\nIn this case, for the sake of transparency, yes; code must be released. Otherwise do like my .5 million population country and count everything by hand with observers half a meter behind you separated by clear perspex.\nI wouldn't be opposed to no electronic voting machines, but there's going to be security vulnerabilities no matter how you count votes.\nAt the very least get rid of these touch screens. There needs to be a paper trail for manual recounts and audits.\nCan you post the results?\nIt is due to their use of only 3 digit precision for the vote share. Needs to be 7 digit.\nUsing only 3 digit leads to very odd things occuring in the data feed. Very suspect as any programmer or data analyst would know you can't be accurate in your calc if your multiplying a large number by only 3 decimal places.\nI suspect this is done to hide the tabulation vote shaving but too much was going on and caused wild swings.\nIn truth we don't know what really was going on unless we can get access to the raw data feeds.\nHowever this along with everything else leads to only one conclusion.... The vote tabulation and counting was being messed with on multiple fronts.\nIt's possible that at least some of these are naturally occurring (either a corrected typo or just a weird quirk of how Edison compiles the data). But it's also possible that some of these are a result of malicious interference. Really no way to prove it one way or the other without getting hands on the source code. And whoever did it likely updated the source code remotely and didn't save it in official repositories.\nI think you need to identify which code, because it looks like interacting systems.\nAnd then there's that, too.\nNice code. Well done\nGood info. This data always looked meh to me. If your data is accurate pushing this data forward will just make us look stupid and give a better case to Biden.\nI think also this would mean even without mass cheating in mail in ballots that Trump should be 600-700k votes ahead. So if these numbers are taken at face value it would mean Trump won PA by ~1 mil when including fraud and this glitch. No way Trump was ever going to win by that margin. Realistically this could maybe account for 50k ish votes if its true\nJoe biden went on stage and claimed he was going to end rhe oil industry... that could sway a lot of votes\ncan you explain the status of this stickied post. Is it BS or does it have any merit?\nThere has been some editing to the original post since my comment and the person above's comment.\nIs the data posted accurate? Yes. The problem is that we don't really know what the data means.\nWhat is lost/switched exactly?\nIn any event, the issue with looking at the absolute values of lost/switched is that it shows big numbers but what does that mean for the end result? The user above me compared switches to Biden and switches to Trump then losses for Biden and losses for Trump. You'll see that in Ohio where Trump won, there were more votes shifted to Trump despite losses than for Biden. Trump won Ohio. Does that mean Trump cheated? If we assume Trump didn't cheat then the fact Biden has more votes shifted to him despite losses in PA for example proves absolutely nothing. To suggest this proves Biden cheated means Trump must have also cheated by the same principal.\nWhat need a breakdown of total shifts to Biden and from Biden as well as total losses from Biden and Trump for each state to then do a comparison to truly see if this is any anomalies. Looking at absolute values of the two combined could be meaningless if the end result is relatively equal gains for Trump as Biden.\nSo what exactly are we looking at then? As of right now what we're looking at means absolutely nothing but it is something that warrants more investigation. it just isn't anything to get as excited about as everyone has been because it doesn't actually prove anything yet.\nYou're missing something very obvious.\nIf the vote counts go up and down for both candidates, it simply means that the numbers are bullshit.\nSo whoever won the election, cheated.\nIt's that simple.\nUnless they can explain exactly why each candidate was gaining and then losing votes, we must assume that all counts are fraudulent. The fact the Biden lost more vote means nothing. They might have simply decided to give Ohio to Trump to make it look more like it's normal to go up and down. But it isn't.\ncc u/TrumanBlack\nThat's if the \"stolen\" and \"lost\" votes are actually \"stolen\" and \"lost\" votes. There might be a missing connection here. They might not actually be \"stolen\" or \"lost\" votes and something else entirely.\nBut this is also why this information is dangerous the way it has been presented. If we say double-down on this information and go look Biden cheated! And everyone is convinced this data proves cheating. What if once a state by state breakdown is uncovered, the end result shows that Trump benefited more than Biden from this \"cheat\"?\nNow you've given ammunition to the other side to say no look Trump cheated that means Biden won despite Trump cheating!\nUntil we truly understand just what exactly this \"stolen\" and \"lost\" means as well as how exactly it applies to the election, it is dangerous to presume too much.\nIt simply means that the machine counts need to be discarded.\nI'd be very interested to see the shift patterns for all states, AND broken down by counties. It seems that cheating would happen more in a few counties in any state, not in all counties -- Not everyone is willing to risk going to prison for their candidate. unless it really is programmed into the software and people didn't know.\nAnyhow -- what I wanted to say about the differences in PA vs. OH is that you have a much larger quantity of shifts in PA (more votes) so I would expect the number of shifts to be closer to even between the two candidates.\nIn Ohio there were only 10 shifts. They favored Trump 7 to 3, which could be fishy, but I find 7 to 3 more believable than I would 700 to 300.\nI would love to hear an explanation of the data, shifts, and losses from an expert on the voting software.\nHow do you explain this though:\nhttps://thedonald.win/p/11Q8O2wesk/x/c/1BiviaabBR?d=50\nHow does Trump's percentage drop by .6% with only 54 new votes?\nYeah, it's weird. This guy is just saying that it's weird both ways. More investigation is needed. This isn't quite a smoking gun yet. I think there might be something here if we pair this analysis with Dr. Shiva's findings.\nDr Shiva's findings are way more likely though. If you were going to rig the thing, would you make it randomly alter a chunk of numbers all of a sudden? That is super obvious. Or would you make it just literally flip single votes right when they are made, not always, but here and there to just shift the results in your favor.\nCompletely agree. It would totally make sense to siphon off votes in heavy Republican areas so that those areas don't flip blue, but in the aggregate flip the state blue.\nWhere the fuck is it switched supposedly anyway?\nWhat has the NYT to do with it? Shouldn\nt the vote be switched at the voting computer?\nOP needs much more clarifications or be labbeled as \"research thread\"\nThat's actually the million dollar question. This data is from a compiling system. I think we'll find votes going both ways at multiple levels but, of course, netting for Joe Biden. It gives plausible deniability for them that way.\nHas anyone replicated your findings? I will try it tonight. Gateway Pundit had their analyst replicate and was successful doing parts of what OP shared.\nAnd this proves that there is fraud.\nhttps://thedonald.win/p/11Q8O2wesk/x/c/1BjFX20AiY\nWhat?\nExplain again a plausible scenario for the vote count going down please.\nWhat's this thing about cache? It didn't display an old count that hasn't been refreshed, it just gave one candidate less votes.\nThank you for the thorough points. I took a quick stab and found NYT data was different from when I downloaded it earlier on a different machine. Did you experience this?\nThks\nI think by calling it \"switched\", OP means that some votes were taken from Trump and given to Biden. \"SOME\" being the important word. Not all. The rest votes disappeared.\nThe one in my comment, I verified myself. It's impossible for 54 votes to change the percentage by .6%.\nFair point. I say more investigation needs to be done to really dig into the raw data and not the data we are getting from NYT. There has to be some raw data which shows the actual number of votes for each candidate.\nThis reminds me of this from CNN:\nhttps://vidmax.com/video/199382-vote-switching-software-caught-in-the-act-taking-votes-from-republican-and-giving-to-democrat-live-on-cnn\nOP's stats are gaining legs here and on Twitter. Here on TDW, this 4-hour-old post:\nhttps://thedonald.win/p/11Q8ShL7R4/will-twitter-shutdown-this-compa/c/\nLinks to this:\nhttps://twitter.com/SysEnfor/status/1326396385651023873/photo/2\nThe Tweet reproduces TrumanBlack's \"switch/lost vote\" table exactly, it's a screenshot apparently.\nI think he just took a screenshot of OP's table. Not original research.\nThat is what caught my attention -- even if someone was cheating and padding things for Biden, there would still be natural glitches where things switched both ways. I asked a few times in here and one or two people told me votes ONLY switched to Trump. But they didn't have a link to any of the data analysis people explicitly saying that.\nI still think somethings very fishy in PA and MI at the very least. If someone who knew the truth held a gun to my head and told me I had to guess accurately if there was massive Dem cheating, I would guess YES.\nNot just as frequently. Also it's still possible that updates which give both candidates votes are tainted too to bias one of the other, just not detectable in this way.\nWe only have the vote % to 3 decimals which isnt precise enough to get the raw votes. If Trump gets 54.3% of 5,433,211 votes, we know he got somewhere around 2.95 million votes but we dont know how many tens of thousands of votes he got without a more accurate percentage.\nYeah, some of it is probably rounding, but some of the differences go beyond that.\nif you have the lot ids to point to in the data I would be happy to look, but this significant figures issue can easily cause discrepancies in the tens of thousands\nWell, I'm not sure what the lot numbers are, but down further in the thread, someone else also noticed it. Unless it's been explained somewhere else, this looks like a 36,000 vote shift over a minute (Could be a lot of votes subtracted from Trump, while a similar number came in from Biden) -\n{\"trumpd\":0.566,\"bidenj\":0.42},\"votes\":2984468,\"eevp\":42,\"eevp_source\":\"edison\",\"timestamp\":\"2020-11-04T04:07:43Z\"},{\"vote_shares\":\n{\"trumpd\":0.56,\"bidenj\":0.426},\"votes\":2984522,\"eevp\":42,\"eevp_source\":\"edison\",\"timestamp\":\"2020-11-04T04:08:51Z\"},{\"vote_shares\":\nAlso, is there a way to get to the real raw data, then? Because, yeah, other than the ~400,000 votes around 2:05 am, and this .006 thing, there's not a lot of accuracy in these dumps with only 3 decimal points. I would want to dig further into it, and do more complicated comparisons.\nCaching. 2 different caching servers, each had pulled results from a central DB at slightly different times. The first request hit server #1, the second request hit server #2\nThis is the most plausible \"legit\" explanation I think\nWhat the analysis should do is compare results from 1 request, to results 10 minutes later. No cache should refresh that slowly. If there is a pattern of vote loss across that time frame, that would be meaningful.\nThen why is it so widely different by state?\nTo play devils advocate, if states all have different data systems. Some would tend to expose more strongly consistent data than others.\nThis was exactly my first thought when seeing this post. However, that doesn't explain the switching behavior.\nIf you're pulling from multiple servers and one is lagging behind the other(s), you would expect the votes count to subtract from all candidates, then be added back to all candidates once it pulls from the up-to-date server.\nBut what we saw on live TV, and in this data, is 19,958 votes getting swapped from Trump to Biden in PA.\nAdditionally, the Michigan software \"glitch\" is captured in this data, adding to its credibility.\nI don't think JSON requests or API requests get cached this way. If that's the explanation given, I won't accept it as it doesn't make any sense imo.\nIf your Json dump is generated from many single api requests, and your api requests are hitting different caching servers on the provider side, then it could be like that.\nThis is hypothetical and I'm playing devils advocate, but I want to cover our bases\nThey can. Caching is an excellent explanation.\nI certainly think more analysis is needed, from official sources. I'm certainly no stat expert but if fraud has been baked into the software, I would think it will be a little more difficult to discover. No offense to anyone, because I think OP is on the right track. The large leads, the no down ticket votes, unbelievable turnout, etc. It's multiple forms of fraud, the software is just a component. They're not gonna put all their eggs in one baaket. The software is probably the fail safe when the other means seemed to be falling short.\nI think what's going on is... People are tying the OPs find into what they saw on their TV screens, where in fact it did appear votes switched from Trump to Biden. Thats where \"switch\" is coming from?\nYes, as this edison data feeds is what was populating the news networks graphic feeds.\nAlso the rounding errors never fully recover after multiple updates. Its not the source of the fraud, but i beleive designed to try and obfuscate the fraud on two fronts.\nKeep the data feed quality down, so one could ideally not see the votes move around and any issues chalked up to rounding error of stream.\nSecond, allow easily manipulation of the data on all news feeds to fit desired narrative.\nProblem i beleive, like in 2016, polls and turnout were way off, and thus the algorithms began to faulter.\nWeighted voting, shaving has to be calibrated to hide it, otherwise signs of manipulation show themselves.\nhttps://youtu.be/Ztu5Y5obWPk\nI'd like to see what the data looks like before Edison does what they do and sell it to the media corporations.\nI haven't looked at this data myself, but something tells me that this is too easy of a find for it to mean anything.\nThanks OP for the taking the time to do this. With all of us working together and most of all with God's help, we will help defeat this attempted steal.\nhttps://thedonald.win/u/PedeInspector/ he Is the Chad but we need to get this trending so trump lawyers see it\nDon’t be so humble. You’ve been working on this for a few days. Thanks to both of you and anyone else who helped in this.\nAre you kidding me, Steve Bannon gave a shout out to the Donald today. They're at least watching the stickies. I guarantee he's still got contacts on the inside. He's too calm and collected for what's going on, he probably knows more than he's letting on/saw the Intel on the vote changing system.\nHe’s really more of a Charles today.\nIf we can prove this, Biden has NO legitimacy\nJust posting so I am recorded as being here in the future historical records.\nI'm doing the same. But damn good work OP!\nPound me too\nI really just want to bump the comment count, and want Trump to in. It's not much, but it's honest work\n[nods and smiles in tendie farming overalls]\nHopping on this train\nCount me in too!\nmetoo\nChoo Choo\nI'm doing my part!\nI want to know more\nHaha, seriously, This is some great work.\nILuvPoms wuz here.\nYou were there the day the deep state died\nhope this is all real, those on the outside think Trump and everyone here are just going through stages of denial.

Anything off on the popular vote counts?\nThank you\nWhat does the word dominion mean? Where is it’s most popular historical usage found? Why do these crazy people support killing babies? They are EVIL. We will not allow the US to be overthrown by a Chinese agent! 0% chance! Audit every state, military controlled hand recount! Dominion should change its name to domino\nIt has an evil connotation now, but it didn't necessarily used to. Canada used to be known as The Dominion of Canada, it was named such from Psalms 72:8 \"He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.”\nBut it absolutely means \"Control\" and specifically \"Absolute Control\" not \"Counting some numbers\" or \"Fair elections.\"\nYou are correct, EVIL uses symbolism. The most popular historic use of \"Dominion\" is in the bible. Evil wants light to dark, good to bad.. Everything they do is on purpose.\nThey just want to repeat Babel in different ways.\nLook at how they want to become false gods. Their desires to subvert what is good and holy is an affront to Him. This is no different. A symbol that they are in full control by the use of a word that has no place in a fucking vote managing or election rrlated company.\nIt's so brazen it's laughable.\nRelevant:\nhttps://www.nowtheendbegins.com/eu-parliament-building-tower-babel-common/\nJust like they say, \"Symbolism will be their downfall.\"\nQ said it would be biblical.\nDominion of Virginia, too.\nOld Dominion\nMoving vans...\n\"Are we the baddies?\"\nIf you really want to freak out, note that Dominion Voting System is aka DVS aka devious.\nhttps://starcraftfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Dominion\n🤔\nTrump is our Jim Raynor\nTo be clear, SC1 Raynor, not SC2 Simp Raynor.\nDo you remember when Jim Raynor first met Kerrigan and she calls him a pig because she read his mind? I always wondered what Jim was thinking that got him in so much trouble, and now I know it was grabbing Karrigan by the pussy.\nTrump is our Tassadar defeating the Overmind (deep state)\nYou have got to be kidding me........\n2.Predominance; ascendancy\n3.Sometimes figurative A kingdom, nation, or other spheres of influence; governed territory.\nAlso, Dominion Voting Systems is abbreviated to DVS (Devious).\nAn area of control. Which makes sense in a voting context since it dictates who controls the area it covers.\njust for the record: is there any votes switched from Biden-->Trump?\nAll of them\nyou mean no Biden votes switched to Trump.\nYep, according to this, the \"glitch\" only went one way. Almost like it was by design.\nThe lost votes are for both candidates though.\nI think u/Pedeinspector said elsewhere that there were a small amount of votes that flipped the other way, like ~25k - but didn’t emphasize it because he wanted Trump team to see this right away.\nI want to get more info on how the JSON was generated, and how OP calculated lost votes.\nI believe the lost votes could be an affect of accessing the data through a caching layer\nI want to verify these findings, as this is potentially massive\nThe JSON is from NYT's API. The raw data comes from Edison Research. If caching were the issue you would see the vote totals revert to a previous number, not for votes to transfer from one candidate to another.\nThis pede codes\nThats a good point and makes sense for a single read cache. I'm thinking of a system with multiple read/write caching servers, and the caching servers aggregate incoming update requests before sending a single update query to the db. You could then have a situation where one server has a pending update with mostly trump votes, while another has a pending update on mostly biden votes. They both won't know about the other's votes until they've sent their respective update queries to the db and have refreshed. If you read data from one or the other, it would look like vote switching.\nAll that said this is very hypothetical.. I wish we had some more info on the underlying systems at play here\nIt’s almost like this is the exact information the FBI or journalists could look into given the power and access they have. Fucking sellouts.\nEvery single vote switched from Trump to Biden?\nNone of them according to OP! Lol.\nNo some did, like in PA it was 20k compared to like 900k.\nI wonder if that is just algorithm adjusting itself\nRotten to the core, these folks\ni think they're mistaken.\nAre you saying that in every situation, some votes were flipped and affected both candidates, but overwhelmingly Trump was the one getting screwed?\nI believe all voted that were dropped eventually made it's way back to Biden. Not sure.\nI think if they were committing massive fraud with mail in ballots, they had to manage the data to prevent 200% turnout. This would explain dropped votes. They kept a conservative estimate to help sell the mail in ballot system.\nWow. Important point.\nYeah that makes a lot sense. “Oops, we are cheating him too much, throw a few back his way until the next dump or else people will notice.”\nThe amount of ballots exceeded voter rolls. They knew not all would be used so they had to dump some to save face.\nI asked him in a previous post. For EG, Trump lost 220k votes to biden in pa but biden only lost 20k to trump. Or something like that.\nWhat are you trying to say?\nMy bad. Deleted. Thanks\nThat the votes were doubled back from trump to Biden then back the other way three times over.\nI really don't think that this is the case.\nhttps://thedonald.win/p/11Q8O0gyAf/x/c/1ATp1A4gC7\nYes. Not as many though.\nhttps://thedonald.win/p/11Q8O0gyAf/x/c/1ATp1A4gC7\nI think you meant the opposite of that.\nNo he means from Biden to Trump. Valid question.\nYeah if these are legit \"mistakes\" or \"glitches\" then it should go both ways.\nBill Binny of the NSA says glitches are really programs into the software, bugs are what happens every single time. Www.x22report.com episode 2323\nNot necessarily when code is involved. It could simply only ever happen one way and still not be nefarious. Just an egregious error. (I'm in no way suggesting it wasn't nefarious given who owns this operation and runs it, i'm just saying from an IT perspective)\nYou can have glitches that use alphabetical order or dates, and things like that. It looks systematic, but it's just luck of the underlying order of the list.\nIt's literally the post though. From the OP:\nA valid question would be asking the opposite to compare/contrast.\nThe Pede I initially responded to was right with what they asked. My brain decided to be smooth momentarily and omitted the word \"from\" for some reason.\nThere were other swithces but much smaller, from what he said in a previous post. Its the first thing i asked in his immediate post.\nIt appears some were, actually, from what I found, most were in Texas. For example\nBiden: 0.509\nTrump: 0.478\nVotes: 7175487\nTimestamp: 2020-11-04T01:42:46Z\nFollowed By\nBiden: 0.508\nTrump: 0.478\nTimestamp: 2020-11-04T01:42:55Z\nYeah, but people are answering that all of them went from Biden to Trump. if that is the case, why are we contesting this....\nPeople are confused for some reason. All of these went from Trump to Biden.\nNo. We need to see if it ONLY went one way. or MASSIVELY one way.\nIf you look for the same going from Biden to Trump and find it, then this finding just means the systems are sketchy. But doesn't mean they are 100% intentionally giving Biden votes.\nIt's a HUGE question.\nIt went massively one way from what he said in a previous post.\nReally it's only a huge question in the sense that we'd like to know in order to go after people for serious crimes in connection with it. If it was a botched update that only mostly gave Trump votes to Biden, I'm satisfied if the return of those votes to Trump means he wins.\nIT WENT FROM TRUMP TO BIDEN READ IT SLOWLY\njust wanted to make sure if there's \"glitches\" both ways or all of them benefit Biden...\nGawddammit - I'm the idiot here. My brain just totally overlooked the word \"FROM\".\nAs you were.\nu/keepituryens\nAlways at attention. The erection won’t go away.\nIts ok. For some reason I was doing the same thing. Brain farts are real.\nHave we seen an answer to this? Did a swap benefit Biden at any time?\nI would like to know as well\nSend this to the heavy hitters\nI assure you,they are reading it right now.\nTop. Men.\nThe best men, believe me\nBased men\nWe got men you probably haven't even heard of looking at this right now\nHow do we know that they read this stuff on here? I'm semi-new here.\nI only know that one of the new lawyers on Trump's team specifically referred to this site as a good resource\nWhat do you think GEOTUS was watching in the Eisenhower Building in real time?\nIt wasn't The Gorilla Channel?\nIt wasn’t RT news\nPicture in picture.\nBeing on the front page of this site is getting it to the heavy hitters.\nDoing my part are you?\n1-800-LAW-1333\nPlease sticky, PLUS, explain in laymens terms what this means for the results in the battleground states!\nThe data that is driving CBS, ABC, NBC, Fox, NYT, and several other media outlets reflects tampering to the tune of switching votes and reducing the overall vote count.\nIf you undo this 'glitch', Trump has won the election outright.\nPlease Lord. Send your Holy Spirit upon America to annihilate this fraud and the traitors behind it once and for al.\nAmen!\nAmen!\nI don’t think Holy Spirit brings death...the Angel of Death however 👀\nI mean no offense, friend, but I have to tell you that God doesn't \"send\" Holy Spirit. I know perfectly well where this idea comes from. \"Holy Spirit you're welcom here, come and have your way.\" That's a cliche in almost every CCM song. That may sound awesome in face value, but unfortunately it's not a sound biblical teaching.\nHere's a little theology lesson: Holy Spirit dwells in belivers and moves in their hearts. God guides you, leads you, helps you, but He certainly doesn't do any of those works for you, He redpills ordinary people and works his miracles through people. That's why He is a LIVING God. Just imagine, there's a big heavy box in the room that needs to be moved from point A to point B, and you're kind of relunctant to do that at the beginning, and then God motivates you as He suddenly makes this task your top priority. He gives you the strength and direction to lift up that box and move it toward the destination, but He won't magically lift it up into the air and move it around for you. Right now He's certainly moving in us as we're movitated to gather evidence and donate to the president. I hope His Holy Spirit is moving in the hearts of the lawyers and ultimately, the SCOTUS justices. They need to open their eyes to see beyond their self interests.\n“I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you”\nBut I mostly agree with what you said and I understand and take no offense!\nThe thing is, He was addressing to His disciples, He was building his church that will become His body, His hands and feet. From there on, His disciples, His ecclesia, were fully devoted to preach His gospel to all four corners of the world. He didn't withdraw the Holy Spirit at some point and send it out again unto us. There was no do-over. In dark times like this, the Holy Spirit that already dwells in us wakes up as we wake up from our spiritual slumber.\nTrue. I really do agree with you. I'm the most intellectually honest person you will ever come across. And I have a sense of peace reading this and I know its the truth.\nBut for clarification. I'm catholic. No idea what CCM is.\n\"Send\" is the wrong word and I was using it too subjectively.\nI've said in other posts that \"the holy spirit is moving\". I do believe he is rising in others.\nCCM stands for Contemporary Christian Music, which is mostly pop and rock with \"christian\" lyrics. You may have heard of Chris Tomlin, Kari Jobe, Natalie Grant, Jeremy Camp, Casting Crown, and the most famous, Hillsong just to name a few. Most of the message in the lyrics is about how God's love sets you free and his spirit lifts you up, pretty generic and underwhelming. Some of them are just about inspiration and motivation with zero mention of any entity in the holy trinity. That being said, I still enjoy them and listen to them almost exclusively, because come on, at least the tune is joyful and uplifting, and the message is positive. There're some really good ones, though, like Sovereign Grace, Kirstyn Getty, Darlene Zschech and Selah, some of their songs are so beautiful, the lyrics are so poetic, full of deep biblical doctrine, they could be qualified as modern hymns.\nSo where did the votes switch? only at the media centers?\nOr did they switch in the counting machines? OP is amazing I`m sure but no normie understands what really happend.\nI also need this question answered please. I'm a little lost.\nWe don't know. We know it happened before the media centers -> Edison Research.\nBut what happened between the precinct counting machines and Edison needs to be investigated. It's possible that if Trump hadn't challenged it, the state election boards would quietly \"adjust\" their numbers to match what was on TV. (or for those that don't, the media would just ignore it)\nWho knows how long this has been going on.\nYou sure? Is this confirmed? Are there switched votes enough for this? Do you take in account the lost votes?\nthe programming appears to systematically switch fractional percentage points-- at least for the presidential race-- from R to D. small and incremental values that you really have to dig into the code to notice but that over time result in hundreds of thousands of switched votes.\nThey pulled an \"Office Space!\"\nAnd soon MIlton (BLM/ANTIFA) will burn down the building with all the evidence.\nDid the libs really use scam from Office Space to try to steal the election? Megalulz\nNahhh even the dude in Office Space said they did it in Superman 3. They had to go to the back of the playbook apparently\nBut how could OP know this without analyzing the proprietary software used on the voting machines?\nYou \"black box\" it. You treat the voting software as a black box, analyze what went in, and what came out.\nSo we can see that 50,000 votes @ 52.6% Trump 47.0% Biden flipped to 50,100 votes 52% Trump 47.6% Biden. Mathematically, that's not possible, so something in the software must have flipped it.\nThanks, makes sense. Next, the cucks will be arguing that math is not logical.\nThey already argue that. They literally argue 2+2=4 is “racist” and that it’s really 2+2=5\nWell if they can’t agree on binary gender then interpreting binary code is hopeless.\nYou don't analyze the software, but the output that is sent to media, which is what he did.\nI'm computer illiterate, but it seems to me that any programmer could look at the code and find the specific bit that performs this function, right? And all these programs currently exist free for the asking in every Dominion voting machine, right?\nWould the physical machines have to be secured to prevent tampering?\nThis was probably in the software that collates the votes from the individual machines, so we'd need to get the server software, not the machine software. If we could get the source-code any competent programmer could figure it out in a day. If we can't we need to disassemble the code (convert it back from 1s and 0s into commands) - but the code that creates is very difficult to read by hand, tedious and a specialized skill. But there are people who specialize in reverse engineering code like this, so it's doable.\nIs it possible this code was only set to run from a script in RAM on Nov 4th early morning and then delete itself afterward to avoid detection?\nThey should have a master image. A digitized harddrive that they then cloned onto every voting machine. If the master image is intact, then it will show this script.\nIf they are smart (tbh kinda doubtful with how obvious this is - if it had been continuous instead of flipping in chunks it never would have been detected) they would use \"arbitrary code execution\" - a code block that will download a script off the internet and run it. This is why Tik Tok was so dangerous - Yes, it saved all your personal information, but it could also run brand new code off the CCP servers at any moment.\nIf Dominion has Arbitrary Code Execution we will see that it has the potential to run random scripts (which no voting software should ever have), but not what it actually did.\nOur saving grace is either:\nThey give us dirty code. We find the code and blast it to the world.\nThey give us clean code. When we rerun the ballots we have 55% GEOTUS.\nMy guess is they play dumb, send the wrong programs several times, and just try to run out the clock to Dec 14\nNo, these are closed source systems. The state governments literally just trusted Dominion not to try any funny business, and nobody thought that was at all suspicious. (or they got a nice fat payout to look the other way)\nDiscoverAfire explained the process of examining them. You can also do black box reverse-engineering to get a good idea of what it does, but not necessarily why.\nI wouldn't say malicious intent necessarily, just intent to manipulate elections or keep an unruly populace within certain guard rails. of course that kind of power will inevitably and immediately be taken advantage of and that's probably by design. to me it's reminiscent of the DNC with their \"super delegates.\" they see it as a fail safe in case the public goes off the rails.\nthe company is apparently partially owned by some powerful dems. I'm not familiar enough to say who or in what positions but it's been reported here a few times.\nWhat do you mean rating system?\nLook at the state you want in the OP's post.\nThat's how many were switched and lost. He said \"lost\" is simply lost but he said in his description that \"switched\" DEFINITELY means switched from Trump to Biden. So the total listed there are rightful Trump votes.\nPeople are questioning if it flipped them from Trump to Biden too as part of the 'glitch' and from what i've read nobody has looked into it hard enough to be certain. But in the case of OPs post, those numbers are referencing Trump to Biden votes the glitch flipped.\nWhat you're looking at in OP's picture seems to be two data objects under the \"timeseries\" node of the presidential election data. This is not official data, but rather meta data used for display i.e. the data comes from somewhere.... is stored into this format, then the webpage/TV parses the data for display.\nSo the \"timeseries\" node appears to have updates for total votes and what percent each candidate has with a timestamp of when the update was recorded. In OP's picture we see the update from 4:07 UTZ had total votes of 2984468 with a .566 for trump and .42 for biden equating to roughly 1689209 votes for Trump and 1253476 votes for Biden\nThe next update, at 4:08 UTZ, the total votes are 2984522 and the ratios are .56 for trump and .426 for biden equating to 1671332 for trump (loss of 17876 votes) and 1271406 for biden (gain of 17930 votes).\nWhat this does NOT mean: someone just flipped the .06 from trump to biden! The way that the data is organized is awkward: why not just store votes for Trump and votes for Biden? My guess is it's easier for parsing and display. Remember: this is just the data that was read in for display on the website/tv. The fact that it's .06 exactly is coincidental.\nWhat this DOES mean: the source from where they were getting data had Trump and Biden at 1689208/1253476 at one point and then 1671332/1271406 about a minute later.\nIf you want to click through the JSON yourself, try an online viewer like this\nI pulled the data into a spread sheet and graphed it\nHere is a full graph of PA with all the data points\nHere is zoomed in on the two points OP has in the picture\nOverall, doesn't look suspicious when you look at the whole graph, tbh. But who knows.\nOk, I get what you're saying. But it still shows Trump lost votes, do we know why? Because, .006 x 2984522 comes out to be a shift of close to 36,000 votes difference from Trump to Biden in a minute's time, but with only 42 votes added overall.\nI made a graph of all data points for PA\nYou can see at the beginning that both candidates go up and down. I'm not saying OP isn't on to something, I'm just saying the data might need to be refined i.e. throw out the obvious erroneous data like at the start of the PA graph.\nI graphed Michigan's data too and zoomed in on the infamous 138k votes. From one data point to the next the total vote increases by about 140k and Trump goes up by about 10k.\nSo stuff like that needs an answer.

Did you ask OP?\nThey already posted the code. 🤷🏼♂️\nYeah, I'd like for all of this to have as much exposure and scrutiny as possible\nWe need to make sure it's 100%\nAnd then we can go after the motherfuckers that did this\nOut of all of the mainframe madmen that have laboriously been digging for the truth in the numbers of this election, why have they ALL been on our side? I suspect that some Leftist autists have done much of the same research, did NOT like what they found, shut off their computer, and did not whisper a word of it to anyone.\nI think it was Scott Adams who noted that the Left's major statistical analysis people have been stewing in abject quiet. There's no way they like what they see here.\nConfirmation bias. I know some VERY lefty statisticians, but none of them want to question the results as they stand. So they just go with the narrative.\nScience is actually more about the questions you ask than the answers you find.\n\"WTF I HATE SCIENCE NOW\"\nYep\nThe left can't meme...I mean math. Because objectivity and 2+2=4 is racism and white supremacy.\nThey can't understand which bathroom to use and you want them to do data analysis?\nDo we have evidence that Edison Research had the correct vote counts? They may just as easily claim that they were correcting data as needed.\nAlso put me in the screencap.\nThat would be insane. It has to be automated. Too much data to keep track of in real time.\n\"We have fired the single intern responsible for all these mistakes. It won't happen again.\"\nMe: \"sir, you don't have any interns per the personnel file.\"\nHire an intern! Then fire them! Then shoot them!\nAh, the Clinton way.\nlol\nAaaaaand he's dead.\nWhile I do agree, there are other explanations they might be able to point to. I want to make sure we have all of our i's dotted and t's crossed.\nMaybe call Edison research (1.908.707.4707) per their website claiming to be a reporter and ask them if they can clarify the irregularities.(If you call, record the hell out of it and fwd to Fitton)\nThey'll be looking to throw anyone else under the bus, if it comes out that the Edison data is bad on such a huge scale, nobody will ever trust that company again. If Edison throws Dominion under the bus, then we'll have evidence on tape.\nWell. That is what the “media” is using to “call” the election. Which, if they are using fraudulent data for their projections, makes the entire thing even more sick.\nSure, but I'm less concerned with the media and more concerned with what our side can use in court.\nThis.\nI mean the votes the media shows on TV must be at some point the same as in \"voting centers\" right there in the states?\nI wish OP would find a way to explain what happened for normies. This will die if someone can't say what happened without talking about 0.05% and computer code..\nExactly. I want to send this around to fellow patriots and cucked friends who think Trump lost but if they asked me what it was I wouldn’t know how to explain it other than it is data of the election taken from code from a company called Edison that monitors vote counts real time and in the code it shows major errors of massive amounts votes switching from Trump to Biden and many more just flat out disappearing. But again most people wouldn’t know what they are looking at and would just say it’s bullshit and without a more detailed explanation I don’t think it would go very far with normies.\nYeah, that is my worry. Was there ever a manual input of the data by a human at any point before Edison data received it? The Ds will just claim accidental human clerical error.\nI think the point is this forces manual recounts.\nThey can try and claim accidental error during their trials for election fraud, but in terms of the election result, whatever they claim is irrelevant if the manual recounts confirm these flips were fraudulently altering the totals.\nSo where did in the tabulation process did the algorithm change the votes, precinct level, county tabulation, or state tabulation?\nMy worry is that if we do a hand recount, then the same algorithm could change the votes the way on state tabulation.\nI think Trump still has to get the illegal votes tossed in order to assure victory.\nIt's the software flipping votes, so a manual recount would take the software out of the equation.\nBut yes, we absolutely need to get the illegal votes tossed as well. At least, those that are identifiable.\nAmy Schumer if true\nOn a slightly related note, you still can't convince me Blasey Ford wasn't Vagina Pizza Schumer in disguise.

The posts, which circulated online weeks after a spike in coronavirus cases in Myanmar, go on to claim the virus affects brain activity in the infected deer, increasing the animal's “desire to attack [humans]” and to “suck blood”. The claim is misleading; experts say there is no such virus that causes deer to “attack” or “suck blood”; as of November 2020, there are no reports of animal to human transmission of neurological diseases affecting deer, including chronic wasting disease (CWD).\nThe claim was published here on a Myanmar-based blog on November 11, 2020.The title of the Burmese-language post translates to English as: “Experts express concerns about the Zombie Virus, scarier than the novel coronavirus”.\nIt reads, in part: “There is a type of virus that experts are now more concerned about than COVID-19: the Zombie Virus. This virus is very similar to the virus in zombies seen in movies, who lose their minds and chase after humans to suck blood.\n“Deer infected with the Zombie Virus are called ‘zombie deer’. The infected deer cannot control their brains, resulting in them losing consciousness and developing a desire to attack.”\nThe claim circulated online just a few weeks after Myanmar reported a spike in coronavirus cases, as reported here by AFP on September 26, 2020. The Southeast Asian nation has one of the world's most impoverished healthcare systems.\nA similar claim was also published here, here, here, here, and here on Facebook. The claim is misleading. Ryan Maddox PhD, an epidemiologist and subject matter expert at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told AFP the posts appear to be referring to “chronic wasting disease (CWD)”, a disease in animals that affects deer, elk, reindeer, sika deer and moose.\nIn an email to AFP on November 21, he said: “[CWD] causes a variety of neurologic symptoms and is eventually fatal...It may take over a year before an infected animal develops symptoms, which can include drastic weight loss (or “wasting”), stumbling, listlessness, and other neurologic symptoms. Sucking blood and attacking other animals are not known to be symptoms of deer, elk, reindeer, sika deer and moose with CWD.\"\nAccording to the CDC website, there are no reported cases of CWD transmission from animals to people. Below is a screenshot of a section of the CDC website, with the relevant section highlighted in red by AFP:\n“For more than 20 years, CDC and its health partners have been monitoring for the possibility of human cases of CWD…to date, there have been no reported cases of CWD infection in people,” Maddox added.\n“However, some animal studies suggest CWD poses a risk to certain types of non-human primates, like monkeys, that eat meat from CWD-infected animals or come in contact with brain or body fluids from infected deer or elk. These studies raise concerns that there may also be a risk to people. Currently, CDC recommends that hunters consider having the deer or elk tested for CWD before consuming the meat if the animal was harvested from an area known to have CWD-positive animals.”\nMultiple keyword searches found no credible reports of health experts expressing “greater concern” about CWD in humans. By contrast, health authorities, governments and doctors worldwide have warned about the danger of contracting the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease Covid-19.\nRef: AFP"}, {"claim": "Out-of-State vehicles took tens of thousands of unsealed Demoncratic ballots to Michigan Counting Center.", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Not Enough Evidence", "justification": "The evidence does not show how many ballots were delivered and from where they came from ", "claim_date": "10-11-2020", "speaker": "Jack Davis", "original_claim_url": "https://www.westernjournal.com/lawsuit-state-vehicles-brought-tens-thousands-unsealed-ballots-michigan-dems/", "fact_checking_article": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210128214313/https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2020/11/fact-check-lawsuit-does-not-claim-out-of-state-vehicles-brought-10s-of-thousands-of-unsealed-ballots-to-michigan-all-for-dems.html", "reporting_source": "Website", "location_ISO_code": "US", "claim_types": ["Event/Property Claim"], "fact_checking_strategies": ["Written Evidence", "Consultation"], "questions": [{"question": "Precisely how many absentee ballots were delivered to the TCF / Michigan counting centre at approximately 430am?", "answers": [{"answer": "No answer could be found.", "answer_type": "Unanswerable", "source_url": "", "source_medium": ""}]}, {"question": "What state were the vehicles from that delivered the ballots?", "answers": [{"answer": "No answer could be found.", "answer_type": "Unanswerable", "source_url": "", "source_medium": ""}]}, {"question": "Were absentee Ballots delivered to the TCF / Michigan counting centre at approximately 430am", "answers": [{"answer": "Yes", "answer_type": "Boolean", "source_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210128154316/https://www.greatlakesjc.org/wp-content/uploads/Complaint-Costantino-FINAL-With-Exhibits.pdf", "source_medium": "PDF", "boolean_explanation": "According to the affidavit."}]}], "orig_claim": "A lawsuit claims that out-of-state vehicles delivered tens-of-thousands of unsealed ballots, all for Democrats, into Michigan.", "orig_verdict": "Not The Claim", "fulltext": "Lawsuit: Out-of-State Vehicles Took Tens of Thousands of Ballots to Michigan Counting Center, All for Biden\nCORRECTION, Nov. 18, 2020: The headline of this article has been changed from “Lawsuit: Out-of-State Vehicles Brought Tens of Thousands of Unsealed Ballots to Michigan, All for Dems” to “Lawsuit: Out-of-State Vehicles Took Tens of Thousands of Ballots to Michigan Counting Center, All for Biden.” The lawsuit does not make it clear that a batch of unsealed ballots is the same as a batch of ballots reportedly delivered in vehicles with out-of-state license plates, nor is there any indication in the lawsuit of the point of origin for those ballots, and therefore no way to know whether they were taken into the state or merely relocated within it. We have also replaced the generic “Dems” in the headline with the more specific “Biden,” and “Brought” with the more grammatically accurate “Took.”\nA major new allegation of voter fraud has been raised in Michigan, where a lawsuit filed by the Great Lakes Justice Center on behalf of two poll challengers says multiple levels of improper conduct took place on orders from election officials.\nThe allegations are aimed at election officials from Detroit and Wayne County, according to a release from the center, and are based on affidavits of named individuals who said they witnessed misconduct.\n“This type of widespread fraud in the counting and processing of voter ballots cannot be allowed to stand. Michigan citizens are entitled to know that their elections are conducted in a fair and legal manner and that every legal vote is properly counted,” senior counsel David A. Kallman said in a statement.\n“Such rampant fraud cannot be undone. We ask the Court to enjoin the certification of this fraudulent election, void the election, and order a new vote in Wayne County.”\nMichigan, along with Pennsylvania, are two major states targeted by President Donald Trump’s campaign, which has alleged widespread voter fraud linked to mail-in ballots cast there.\nThe lawsuit, filed by poll challengers Cheryl A. Costantino and Edward P. McCall Jr., cite what the legal filing calls “numerous issues of fraud and misconduct.”\nThe lawsuit seeks a temporary restraining order that would prohibit officials from certifying the vote until the charges made in the lawsuit can be investigated.\n“Defendants systematically processed and counted ballots from voters whose name failed to appear in either the Qualified Voter File (QVF) or in the supplemental sheets. When a voter’s name could not be found, the election worker assigned the ballot to a random name already in the QVF to a person who had not voted,” the complaint reads.\n“Defendants instructed election workers to not verify signatures on absentee ballots, to backdate absentee ballots, and to process such ballots regardless of their validity,” the complaint went on, adding another allegation that election workers were told “to process ballots that appeared after the election deadline and to falsely report that those ballots had been received prior to November 3, 2020 deadline.”\nThe lawsuit said ballots seemed to just keep appearing.\n“After election officials announced the last absentee ballots had been received, another batch of unsecured and unsealed ballots, without envelopes, arrived in trays at the TCF Center. There were tens of thousands of these absentee ballots, and apparently every ballot was counted and attributed only to Democratic candidates,” the complaint read.\n“Unsecured ballots arrived at the TCF Center loading garage, not in sealed ballot boxes, without any chain of custody, and without envelopes.”\nThe complaint alleged that some ballots arrived in vehicles with out-of-state license plates, and that “[i]t was observed that all of these new ballots were cast for Joe Biden.”\nThe complaint went on to claim that election workers “systematically used false information to process ballots, such as using incorrect or false birthdays. Many times, the election workers inserted new names into the QVF after the election and recorded these new voters as having a birthdate of 1/1/1900.”\nOversight was denied, according to the complaint.\n“Defendant election officials and workers refused to record challenges to their processes and removed challengers from the site if they politely voiced a challenge. After poll challengers started discovering the fraud taking place at the TCF Center, Defendant election officials and workers locked credentialed challengers out of the counting room so they could not observe the process, during which time tens of thousands of ballots were processed,” the complaint read.\n“Defendant election officials and workers allowed ballots to be duplicated by hand without allowing poll challengers to check if the duplication was accurate.

Thank you. Thank you very much. Please sit. Thank you. This is without question the latest news conference I’ve ever had. Thank you. I appreciate it very much. And I want to thank the American people for their tremendous support, millions and millions of people voted for us tonight. And a very sad group of people is trying to disenfranchise that group of people and we won’t stand for it. We will not stand for it.\nDonald Trump: (00:54)\nI want to thank the first lady, my entire family, and Vice President Pence, Mrs. Pence for being with us all through this. And we were getting ready for a big celebration. We were winning everything and all of a sudden it was just called off. The results tonight have been phenomenal and we are getting ready… I mean, literally we were just all set to get outside and just celebrate something that was so beautiful, so good. Such a vote, such a success to citizens of this country have come out in record numbers. This is a record. There’s never been anything like it to support our incredible movement. We won states that we weren’t expected to win. Florida, we didn’t win it. We won it by a lot.\nDonald Trump: (01:54)\nWe won the great State of Ohio. We won Texas, we won Texas. We won Texas. We won Texas by 700,000 votes and they don’t even include it in the tabulations. It’s also clear that we have won Georgia. We’re up by 2.5% or 117,000 votes with only 7% left. They’re never going to catch us. They can’t catch us. Likewise we’ve clearly won North Carolina. Where we’re up 1.4%. We’re 77,000 votes with only approximately 5% left. They can’t catch us. We also, if you look and you see Arizona, we have a lot of life in that. And somebody declared that it was a victory for… And maybe it will be. I mean, that’s possible. But certainly there were a lot of votes out there that we could get because we’re now just coming into what they call Trump territory. I don’t know what you call it. But these were friendly Trump voters. And that could be overturned.\nDonald Trump: (03:14)\nThe gentleman that called it, I watched tonight. He said, “Well, we think it’s fairly unlikely that he could catch.” Well, fairly unlikely? And we don’t even need it. We don’t need that. That was just a state that if we would have gotten it, it would have been nice. Arizona. But there’s a possibility, maybe even a good possibility. In fact, since I saw that originally it’s been changed and the numbers have substantially come down just in a small amount of votes. So we want that obviously to stay in play. But most importantly, we’re winning Pennsylvania by a tremendous amount of votes.\nDonald Trump: (04:14)\nWe’re up 600… Think of this. Think of this. Think of this. We’re up 690,000 votes in Pennsylvania, 690,000. These aren’t even close. This is not like, “Oh, it’s close…” With 64% of the vote in, it’s going to be almost impossible to catch. And we’re coming into good Pennsylvania areas where they happen to like your president. I mean, it’s very good. So we’ll probably expand that. We’re winning Michigan, but I’ll tell you, I looked at the numbers. I said, “Wow.” I looked, I said, “Wow, that’s a lot.” By almost 300,000 votes and 65% of the vote is in and we’re winning Wisconsin. And I said, “Well, we don’t need all of them. We need…” Because when you add Texas in, which wasn’t added, I spoke with the really wonderful governor of Texas just a little while ago, Greg Abbott, he said, “Congratulations.” He called me to congratulate me on winning Texas.\nDonald Trump: (05:26)\nI mean, we won Texas. I don’t think they finished quite the tabulation, but there’s no way. And it was almost complete, but he congratulated me. Then he said, “By the way, what’s going on? I’ve never seen anything like this.” Can I tell you what, nobody has. So we won by 107,000 votes with 81% of the vote. That’s Michigan. So when you take those three states in particular and you take all of the others, I mean, we have so many… We had such a big night. You just take a look at all of these states that we’ve won tonight, and then you take a look at the kind of margins that we’ve won it by, and all of a sudden, it’s not like we’re up 12 votes and we have 60% left. We won states. And all of a sudden I said, “What happened to the election? It’s off.” And we have all these announcers saying what happened? And then they said, “Oh.”\nDonald Trump: (06:24)\nBecause you know what happened? They knew they couldn’t win so they said, “Let’s go to court.” And did I predict this, Newt? Did I say this? I’ve been saying this from the day I heard they were going to send out tens of millions of ballots. They said exactly, because either they were going to win or if they didn’t win, they’ll take us to court. So Florida was a tremendous victory. 377,000 votes. Texas, as we said. Ohio, think of this. Ohio a tremendous state, a big state. I love Ohio. We won by 8.1%, 460,00…think of this. Almost 500,000 votes. North Carolina, a big victory with North Carolina. So we won there. We lead by 76,000 votes with almost nothing left. And all of a sudden everything just stopped.\nDonald Trump: (07:28)\nThis is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election. We did win this election. So our goal now is to ensure the integrity for the good of this nation. This is a very big moment. This is a major fraud in our nation. We want the law to be used in a proper manner. So we’ll be going to the US Supreme Court. We want all voting to stop. We don’t want them to find any ballots at four o’clock in the morning and add them to the list. Okay? It’s a very sad moment. To me this is a very sad moment and we will win this. And as far as I’m concerned, we already have won it.\nDonald Trump: (08:30)\nSo I just want to thank you. I want to thank all of our support. I want to thank all of the people that worked with us. And Mr. Vice President, say a few words, please. Please.\nMike Pence: (08:46)\nThank you, Mr. President. I want to join you in thanking more than 60 million Americans who have already cast their vote for four more years for president Donald Trump in the White House. While the votes continue to be counted, we’re going to remain vigilant, as the president said. The right to vote has been at the center of our democracy since the founding of this nation and we’re going to protect the integrity of the vote. But I really believe with all of my heart, with the extraordinary margins, Mr. President, that you’ve inspired in the states that you just described, and the way that you launched this movement across the country to make America great again, I truly do believe as you do that we are on the road to victory and we will make America great again, again. Thank you, Mr. President.\nDonald Trump: (09:51)\nThank you very much [inaudible 00:09:56].
