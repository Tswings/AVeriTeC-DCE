Moreover, these suspicious media outlets completely ignore the fact that Israel possesses an arsenal of chemical and nuclear weapons that endangers the security and peace in the region and in the world as a whole.\nExperts, who had previously worked at the OPCW, presented testimonies that all the accusations fabricated against Syria aimed to implement US and Western political agendas.\nGh.A.Hassoun"}, {"claim": "Illegal drug, border crossings, and human smuggling activities have decreased in areas where barriers are deployed in the United States.", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Not Enough Evidence", "justification": "15 miles of new barriers seems unlikely to account for the halving of illegal crossing from 2019 to 2020.

We can have economic freedom and opportunity, and resist cancel culture and censorship. We can put annus horribilis, 2020, behind us and make America great again, again. We can do all this — if we make the right choice on Nov. 3.\nThe New York Post endorses President Donald J. Trump for re-election.\n*\nElections are always about the economy, but never more so than this year.\nSo a reminder: Until the necessary shutdown to fight the coronavirus, the unemployment rate stood at 3.5 percent, the lowest in a half-century. African American unemployment was 6.8 percent, the lowest figure since 1972.\nAdults out of the workforce for years found new prospects; for 17 months of Trump’s term, there were 1 million more job openings than people unemployed.\nThat drove up salaries. For the first time in a decade, wage growth exceeded 3 percent year-over-year. It also narrowed the wealth gap. Between 2016 and 2019, real median incomes rose the most, 9 percent, for those without a high school diploma. Real median incomes declined 2.3 percent for those with a college degree, mostly because older workers retired, according to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances.\nHow did President Trump do it? First, by trusting the free market. He championed lowering the corporate tax rate to a figure more in line with the rest of the industrialized world. He cut cumbersome regulations, particularly ones rammed through as President Barack Obama was headed out the door. He streamlined the permitting process that would delay infrastructure projects by years, sometimes decades.\nA Joe Biden administration would be beholden to a socialist left that sees an opportunity to remake the nation in its vision, one more dependent on government debt. Consider Biden’s dance on fracking — against it for his party, in favor of it in general because he knows what a positive force it’s been for Pennsylvania. Which position would he have in office?\nTrump also rejected the globalist axiom that trade deals and unfettered immigration were better for Americans. The US has lost 3.7 million jobs to China since 2001, according to the Economic Policy Institute. And this undermining of our workers with cheap foreign labor did nothing to encourage openness and democracy in Beijing. China’s authoritarianism has only grown worse with concentration camps for Uighurs, crackdowns in Hong Kong and the shuttering of independent churches. The nation remains a manipulative planned economy that devalues its currency and exploits its trade deficit.\nFurther, the president recognized that unfettered illegal immigration was unfair to American workers, a common-sense belief held by such right-wingers as Bernie Sanders.\nBiden would open the border floodgates again, and by all appearances would go back to “normalization” with China — a byword for them eating our lunch.\n*\nDomestically, President Trump has rolled back the excesses of previous administrations.\nHis Education Department reversed Obama’s spectacular overreach that turned college bureaucrats into star-chamber judges in sexual assault cases, with no rights for the accused. He’s encouraged school choice — a work in progress that Biden would stifle because of his fealty to the teachers unions. Trump passed criminal justice reform, freeing those locked up far past the point of reasonable punishment. He rightly railed against the permissiveness of politicians in cities such as Portland to the lawlessness on their streets.\nHe’s defended pride in American values against those who slander our entire nation as a racist enterprise.\nMost importantly, throughout his time in office and culminating with the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett, Trump’s judicial appointments promise to curb the leftward shift of the courts and the activism that Democrats have come to count on. The left has achieved through legal decisions what it couldn’t through legislation.\nA new crop of judges and justices promises to decide the law on its constitutionality, not through activism.\n*\nJoe Biden has tried to make this election about the coronavirus, but it’s unclear he’d do anything different except trigger new lockdowns — a strategy the WHO now discourages.\nTrump is criticized for his early handling of the virus, but his institution of a travel ban and aid to the states undoubtedly saved lives. The same perfect hindsight the media expects of the president they rarely apply to others. Consider that Gov. Andrew Cuomo wrote a self-praising book about his response to COVID-19, even though New York’s death toll is higher than that of any other state. And because he’s a Democrat, the media let him get away with it!\nToday, those who are infected with the coronavirus survive at much higher rates. We are likely to have a vaccine in the coming months, far earlier than many experts thought possible. The media don’t want to admit it, but that’s all thanks to the “warp speed” policy instituted by the White House.\n*\nOn foreign policy, President Trump has repeatedly embarrassed the conventional wisdom. After previous administrations promised but did not move our embassy to Jerusalem, he did so, and, despite the doomsayers, nothing happened.\nThe Obama administration tried to co-opt Iran with bundles of cash, which the theocratic regime used to sow chaos across the region, stirring up unrest in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and the West Bank. The Trump administration cut off the money, killed the architect of the terror campaign, Qasem Soleimani, and, despite the doomsayers, the world became safer. The result? Arab nations have increasingly accepted Israel, signing historic peace deals.\nAs promised, Trump has not entangled us in new foreign wars, and has been pulling us out of the old ones. He cajoled Mexico to handle immigration caravans from Central America, and successfully pushed NATO allies to pay more of their commitments. When journalists write that the United States has “lost its standing in the world,” they usually mean our standing at Davos cocktail parties. For the rest of us, it’s clear that Trumpism is focused on pursuing what’s best for our country.\n*\nHere’s the part about Twitter. This paper has, before the 2016 election and often through his term, bemoaned President Trump’s habit of speaking before he thinks. Trump himself admitted in an interview with Barstool Sports in July: “It used to be in the old days before this, you’d write a letter and you’d say, ‘This letter is really bad,’ you put it on your desk and you go back tomorrow and you say, ‘Oh, I’m glad I didn’t send it.’ But we don’t do that with Twitter.”\nHe’s vainglorious and thin-skinned. He cannot change, and nothing we say will curb those impulses — though we acknowledge that considering how frequently Democrats have pushed discredited theories about Russian collusion and insulted his every action, Trump can be forgiven for being angry. Twitter gives him an unfiltered platform to push back and present his side to the American people.\nWe can only counsel that a president who lowers the temperature rather than pouring gasoline on every fire will have a happier nation (and a higher approval rating).\nThe question is what matters more: words or actions? The media are enormously fixated on Trump’s tweets and extemporaneous remarks, never learning the lesson that most of the time, he is just riffing. In endorsing him, we’re choosing to focus on President Trump’s actions and accomplishments. He has kept his promises.\n*\nAs this campaign has made clear, Joe Biden is a figurehead candidate for the Democratic Party. He rarely takes questions, sticks to his stump speeches, puts a lid on the day at the late hour of 9 a.m. There’s no reason to think his presidency would be any different. The assurgent left of the party, AOC and the Squad, are salivating at the possibility of pushing through their agenda. Kamala Harris is measuring the drapes. Whatever moderate impulses Joe Biden may have, expect them to evaporate quickly in office — particularly if there’s a united blue Congress behind him.\nPresident Trump will not be looking to remake the country. He will trust that America will, given support but not interference, bounce back. He will, in short, not get in the way. Re-electing him is the best choice for the United States.\nPlus, it’ll really tick off Hollywood."}, {"claim": "An 'anti-Black Lives Matter' flag replaced the American flag behind President Trump during a Waukesha campaign rally.", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Supported", "justification": "The 2nd QA seems to support this claim.", "claim_date": "24-10-2020", "speaker": "Jeff Sharlet", "original_claim_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210529130838/https://twitter.com/JeffSharlet/status/1320189238214799360", "fact_checking_article": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210525130943/https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/10/28/fact-check-thin-blue-line-flag-prominent-trump-rallies/6058924002/", "reporting_source": "Facebook", "location_ISO_code": "US", "claim_types": ["Event/Property Claim"], "fact_checking_strategies": ["Written Evidence"], "questions": [{"question": "What flag is seen as an anti Black Lives Matter flag?", "answers": [{"answer": "The Blue Lives Matter Flag is said to have racist symbolism which is anti Black Lives Matter.", "answer_type": "Extractive", "source_url": "https://www.reformer.com/opinion/letters/letter-racist-symbolism-behind-the-blue-lives-matter-flag/article_ebf0cd26-2791-513a-8372-96edf1c48ae4.html", "source_medium": "Web text"}]}, {"question": "Did the Blue Lives Matter Flag show at a Donald trump Rally in Waukesha campaign rally in 2020?", "answers": [{"answer": "Yes", "answer_type": "Boolean", "source_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210525130943im_/https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2887f5d7d58a75a6437c45e987fd994202334aff/c=0-156-3000-1844/local/-/media/2020/10/17/Rockford/ghows_gallery_ei-IR-201019800-593e424c.jpg?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "source_medium": "Web text", "boolean_explanation": "A large Blue Lives Matter Flag was behind the podium on which Donald Trump spoke at during the Waukesha rally."}]}], "orig_claim": "An 'anti-Black Lives Matter' flag replaced the American flag behind President Trump during a Waukesha campaign rally", "orig_verdict": "True", "fulltext": "“Tonight in Wisconsin.

People will be invited to parties - like chicken pox parties - so you don't get it when you're older - but we’ll have to wait and see!'\nDiscussing an exit strategy for the pandemic, he said the virus was here to stay with the final aim being 'herd immunity' either through a vaccine or natural infections.\nProfessor Tracy Hussell, the director for inflammation research at the University of Manchester, explained at least 60 per cent of the UK population needs a level of immunity to the virus before going back to normal can be considered.\nPublic Health England has estimated only eight per cent of the UK has so far had the virus, and hence has a level of immunity.\nResponding to MailOnline's query whether there is a way to avoid the 'herd immunity' strategy, she said: 'I think ultimately a virus works its way out of a community because most of the people become immune to it.\n'The sensitivity to herd immunity was because if we let that happen a lot of elderly people will die, and we didn't want to go the herd immunity approach because a lot of people will die.'\nShe added: 'Herd immunity is what we aim for, whether by vaccination or actual infection. Clearly vaccination is best, but herd immunity is the answer.'\nBritons under 40 have just a 0.1 per cent risk of dying from an infection, modelling by the Government's scientific advisers in SAGE spin-off SPI-M-O has revealed. But for those aged over 70 the risk may be as high as 7.2 per cent.\nOffice of National Statistics data shows 0.5 per cent of all fatalities (316 out of 53,030 up to October 9) have been in people aged under 40. For comparison, almost 84 per cent of all fatalities (44,384) have been in people aged over 70.\nPrevious studies have suggested that immunity to the virus may not persist long in people who have been struck down by the virus - and there are a handful of reported cases of re-infection.\nBut Professor Hussell said it was most likely that immunity would persist for longer in some populations than in others.\nProfessor Lehner added: 'I agree endemic coronavirus immunity may wane, but there's underlying background immunity which means when you get it you're not going to get as sick.\n'We have to be optimistic and say this is the sort of thing our immune system has developed to deal with.\n'If you are born today, you're going to be exposed to the virus at a young age.'\nThe scientists did not give a time for when life can return to pre-March 2020, but said a fall in hospitalisations that then stays down - in the absence of a vaccine - could be used as a bell-weather for when restrictions can start to slacken again.\n'When the hospitalisations start going down again and they stay down I think that’s the signal for going back to where we were before,' said Professor Hussell.\nStudies on patients who died from the virus in Trieste, Italy, have revealed large sections of their lungs were replaced with fibrous tissue (shown). This may cause 'long Covid'\nInfection with the virus can also cause cells to clump together. Pictured left are the cells in a healthy lung with red the cell wall and white the nucleus; and right are the cells during an infection where they have clearly clumped together\nVaccine 'may be less effective' for older people, scientist warns\nA coronavirus vaccine may be less effective for older people, a scientist has warned.\nProfessor Tracy Hussell, from Manchester University, said when we age the viral alert systems in the body become 'slower' - a condition called immunosenescence.\nWhen people are young the immune system is active and ready to fight off infections.\nIt creates T cells which remember the design of antibodies - which bind to viruses to stop them damaging cells.\nThese are stored in the thymus - a gland that sits above the heart.\nBut by the time we hit 65 this has shrunk to 40 per cent of its original size, decreasing the number of T cells in the body and reducing immunity.\n'One reason (for this) is the immune system becomes exhausted by exposure to repeated infections,' said Hussell.\n'If you add gender into this as well, being old and male increases the risk factors even further.'\nThey said mass testing to pick up asymptomatic testing could also be used because it would enable people to attend venues knowing no one had Covid-19.\nProfessor Mauro Giacca, from King's College London, said this tool can help people return to normality.\n'I think routine testing before some activities could help returning to a semi-normal life.\n'But it is not 100 per cent sure, but it certainly helps in addressing the problems of having a semi-normal life.'\nThe virus is having such a large impact because it is a type that has 'never been seen before', meaning it is a shock to our immune systems, they added.\nIt is unique from other coronaviruses, including SARS and MERS, in that someone can start spreading it without developing symptoms of the virus, and in its symptoms of loss of taste and smell and thrombosis - blocked blood vessels.\nOnce it infects someone the virus manages to turn someone's nose into a 'replication factory' for 24 hours before they come down with an infection.\nIt goes undetected as it interrupts the transmission of a chemical - called interferon - which is released by cells to signal they are under attack and trigger an immune response.\n'When we look at virus infected cells we can't even tell they are infected,' said Professor Lehner. 'Yet when we stain (the cells) they are screaming with virus.'\nMicroscopic images from infected patients have also revealed cells being broken open and coagulating together, with all their nuclei gathering in one place.\nResearch into patients that had died after up to 40 days in intensive care at Trieste hospital, Italy, also revealed large sections of the lung had been replaced with fibrotic tissue.\nThe scientists said if this persists in the lungs, it may explain why some individuals are suffering from 'long Covid'.\nA study published yesterday by King's College London revealed as many as one in ten people under 40 could be struck by the condition.\nAnd women were 50 per cent more likely to suffer from the condition than men.\nSymptoms include chronic fatigue, chest pains and breathing difficulties.\nResearchers at King's College London made the find after using data from 4,000 contributors to the Covid Symptom Study app who had all tested positive for the coronavirus.\nStudies on patients in Trieste also revealed extensive blood clotting in the lungs of patients who had succumbed to the disease\nAbove are cells that are abnormally fused due to infection with the virus\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article."}, {"claim": "People who do not vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2020 elections will not get the COVID vaccine free of cost.", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Refuted", "justification": "The answer shows that the claim is false and so the claim is refuted.", "claim_date": "22-10-2020", "speaker": "Firoz Khan ", "original_claim_url": "https://twitter.com/sirfirozkhan/status/1319360671729922048", "fact_checking_article": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210301174114/https://www.vishvasnews.com/english/politics/fact-check-posts-claiming-about-no-vote-no-covid-vaccine-is-misleading/", "reporting_source": "Twitter", "location_ISO_code": "IN", "claim_types": ["Causal Claim", "Event/Property Claim"], "fact_checking_strategies": ["Written Evidence", "Consultation"], "questions": [{"question": "What did the BJP party say concerning the claims of them giving vaccines to olny those who vote for them", "answers": [{"answer": "A senior BJP leader denied the claims and said the party had plans according to their manifesto to vaccinate everyone", "answer_type": "Abstractive", "source_url": "https://web-archive-org.translate.goog/web/20210121222119/https://www.jagran.com/elections/bihar-vidhan-sabha-nirmala-sitharaman-said-the-promise-of-free-covid-vaccine-in-bihar-election-manifesto-is-absolutely-correct-20947267.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US&_x_tr_pto=wapp", "source_medium": "Web text"}]}], "orig_claim": "Free covid vaccine only if you vote for BJP", "orig_verdict": "Half true", "fulltext": "Disaster has to be turned into opportunity, all have to be injected.

It’s realty [sic] an honor and pleasure,” the email reads.\nAn earlier email from May 2014 also shows Pozharskyi, reportedly Burisma’s No. 3 exec, asking Hunter for “advice on how you could use your influence” on the company’s behalf.\nThe blockbuster correspondence — which flies in the face of Joe Biden’s claim that he’s “never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings” — is contained in a massive trove of data recovered from a laptop computer.\nThe computer was dropped off at a repair shop in Biden’s home state of Delaware in April 2019, according to the store’s owner.\nCatch up on Twitter’s censorship of The Post’s Hunter Biden laptop story\n- Happening now: Email found on Hunter’s laptop reveals Joe Biden named in 2017 message seeking China natural gas deal\n- Our original report: Smoking-gun email reveals how Hunter Biden introduced Ukrainian businessman to VP dad\n- Editorial: Why has the public turned against “experts”?

If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money,” Biden infamously bragged to the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018.\n“Well, son of a bitch. He got fired.”\nShokin has said that at the time of his firing, in March 2016, he’d made “specific plans” to investigate Burisma that “included interrogations and other crime-investigation procedures into all members of the executive board, including Hunter Biden.”\nJoe Biden has insisted that the US wanted Shokin removed over corruption concerns, which were shared by the European Union.\nMeanwhile, an email dated May 12, 2014 — shortly after Hunter Biden joined the Burisma board — shows Pozharskyi attempting to get him to use his political leverage to help the company.\nThe message had the subject line “urgent issue” and was also sent to Hunter Biden’s business partner, Devon Archer, who also sat on the Burisma board at the time.\nPozharskyi said that “the representatives of new authorities in power tend to quite aggressively approach N. Z. unofficially with the aim to obtain cash from him.”\nN.Z. isn’t identified in the email but appears to be a reference to Burisma founder Mykola Zlochevsky, whose first name is a Ukrainian version of “Nicholas.”\nWhen the alleged shakedown failed, “they proceeded with concrete actions” in the form of “one or more pretrial proceedings,” Pozharskyi wrote.\n“We urgently need your advice on how you could use your influence to convey a message / signal, etc .to stop what we consider to be politically motivated actions,” he added.\nHunter Biden responded by saying he was with Archer in Doha, Qatar, and asked for more information about “the formal (if any) accusations being made against Burisma.”\n“Who is ultimately behind these attacks on the company? Who in the current interim government could put an end to such attacks?” he added.\nThe exchange came the same day that Burisma announced it had expanded its board of directors by adding Hunter Biden, who was put in charge of its “legal unit and will provide support for the Company among international organizations,” according to a news release that’s since been scrubbed from Burisma’s website.\nHunter Biden actually joined the board in April 2014, according to multiple reports.\nHis lawyer said last year that Hunter was “not a member of the management team,” adding, “At no time was Hunter in charge of the company’s legal affairs.”\nAbout four months after Hunter Biden’s correspondence with Pozharskyi, Archer forwarded Hunter Biden an email chain with the subject line “tax raise impact on Burisma production,” which included Pozharskyi saying that the Ukrainian cabinet had submitted new tax legislation to the country’s parliament.\n“If enacted, this law would kill the entire private gas production sector in the bud,” Pozharskyi wrote.\nIn the Sept. 24, 2014, email, Pozharskyi also said he was “going to share this information with the US embassy here in Kyiv, as well as the office of Mr Amos Hochstein in the States.”\nAt the time, Hochstein was the State Department’s newly appointed special envoy and coordinator for international energy affairs.\nIn December 2017, the Naftogaz Group, Ukraine’s state-owned energy company, announced that Hochstein had joined the company as an independent director, but on Monday he announced his resignation.\n“The company has been forced to spend endless amounts of time combating political pressure and efforts by oligarchs to enrich themselves through questionable transactions,” Hochstein wrote in an op-ed published by the Kyiv Post.\nIn addition to denying that’s he’s spoken to Hunter Biden about his overseas business dealings, Joe Biden has repeatedly denied any conflict of interest or wrongdoing by either of them involving Burisma.\nLast February, he got testy during an appearance on NBC’s “Today” show when co-host Savannah Guthrie questioned whether it was “wrong for [Hunter] to take that position, knowing that it was really because that company wanted access to you.”\n“Well, that’s not true. You’re saying things you do not know what you’re talking about,” the elder Biden responded.\nLast December, Joe Biden also lashed out during a Democratic primary town hall event in Iowa, where a man accused him of sending Hunter to Ukraine “to get a job and work for a gas company, he had no experience with gas or nothing, in order to get access to . . . the president.”\n“You’re a damn liar, man. That’s not true and no one has ever said that,” Biden fumed.\nBiden then continued berating the man as he stepped forward, called the man “fat” and challenged him to “do push-ups together, man.”\nThe FBI referred questions about its seizure of the laptop and hard drive to the Delaware US Attorney’s Office, where a spokesperson said, “My office can neither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation.”\nHunter Biden’s lawyer refused to comment on the specifics but instead attacked Giuliani.\n“He has been pushing widely discredited conspiracy theories about the Biden family, openly relying on actors tied to Russian intelligence,” the lawyer, George R. Mesires, said of Giuliani.\nPozharskyi and the Joe Biden campaign did not return requests for comment. Hochstein could not be reached.\nAdditional reporting by Ebony Bowden"}, {"claim": "There is a scam involving Santander customers being sent fake bank cards.", "required_reannotation": true, "label": "Not Enough Evidence", "justification": "Q&A 1 says that Santander was issuing new bank cards but makes no reference to the claim about a scam being linked to fake issued bank cards,  Q&A 2 and 3 give no answer for their questions so needs more evidence overall for the claim points.", "claim_date": "21-10-2020", "speaker": "Nigel Howard Berry", "original_claim_url": "https://www.facebook.com/groups/719779154837578/permalink/1864476120367870/", "fact_checking_article": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210228033931/https://fullfact.org/online/santander-card-scam/", "reporting_source": "facebook", "location_ISO_code": "GB", "claim_types": ["Event/Property Claim"], "fact_checking_strategies": ["Written Evidence", "Consultation"], "questions": [{"question": "Was Santander issuing new debit cards early?", "answers": [{"answer": "Yes", "answer_type": "Boolean", "source_url": "https://twitter.com/santanderukhelp/status/1359776098544988160", "source_medium": "Web text", "boolean_explanation": "We are currently in the process of changing all of our customers from a Visa Debit card to a Debit MasterCard."}]}, {"question": "Is there any evidence of a scam involving Santader debit cards in Oct 2020?", "answers": [{"answer": "No answer could be found.", "answer_type": "Unanswerable", "source_url": "", "source_medium": ""}]}, {"question": "What did Santander say about the claim there's a scam running in their name", "answers": [{"answer": "No answer could be found.", "answer_type": "Unanswerable", "source_url": "", "source_medium": ""}]}], "orig_claim": "There is a scam involving Santander customers being sent fake bank cards.", "orig_verdict": "We can’t find any evidence that this scam exists.", "fulltext": "Beware! \n\nI received new bank card yesterday from Santander\nwhich I thought was a bit strange as there still 9 months to go on my current one.\nIt wasn't contactless either like my current card.\nIt had all my info on the letter from Santander about how to activate it.\nWell as it wasnt contactless it's not much use to me so I went into the bank today to ask them to change it.\nThey informed me that they hadn't sent out the card and it was a good job I had gone in.\nIf I had activated it I would of lost all my money and savings.\nThe Major fraud squad are now involved.\nPeople say to me I'm too suspicious of people.\nGood job I am not so gullible.\nThe bank has now ordered me a new card and I've changed all my security details."}, {"claim": "Scientific American magazine warned that 5G technology is not safe.", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Refuted", "justification": "There is no convincing evidence that 5G technology is unsafe.

Their concerns about both the known and the potential dangers of 5G carry a lot of weight because the magazine is so influential and known for its rigorous scientific standards. In print since 1845, Scientific American is widely considered by modern fact checkers to be pro-science and highly credible.\nPublic health researcher Joel M. Moskowitz of the University of California, Berkeley, says in the article that 5G is a lot more harmful than the government and telecommunications industry want people to believe. He also said the same is true of Wi-Fi and cellular technology.\nExposure limits are outdated\nOne of his biggest concerns is related to the fact that the FCC is reaffirming exposure limits for radio frequency radiation, or RFR, that were put in place in the 1990s long before Wi-Fi, 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G existed. In other words, the FCC plans to maintain significantly outdated safety standards that do not take into account the increasing pile of evidence showing that it is harmful in many ways.\nAccording to Moskowitz, the exposure limits set in the ‘90s were mostly related to the potential effects of RFR exposure intensity. Now, however, we know that there is a risk of cancer and other problems.\n5G will introduce the use of millimeter waves, in addition to the microwaves that older cellular technologies used. Moreover, the limited reach of 5G means cell antennas will need to be placed every 100 to 200 meters, increasing people’s exposure. On top of that, new technologies in 5G such as beam-forming antennas, massive MIMO, and phased arrays, will make it difficult to measure exposure.\nShort-term exposure to millimeter waves, which are absorbed by human skin and the surface layer of the cornea, can affect the nervous, cardiovascular and immune systems. Long-term exposure could put people at risk of melanoma, ocular melanoma and sterility.\nMoskowitz argues that new exposure limits should be put in place that account for certain effects of signals, such as polarization and pulsing, that raise their health and biologic impacts. The current RFR exposure limits set by the FCC regulate the intensity of the exposure but ignore the RFR’s signaling properties.\nMoskowitz also referred to the International EMF Scientist Appeal, which outlines how EMF impacts living beings at levels that are significantly below most guidelines. These effects include cellular stress, rises in harmful free radicals, reproductive system changes, neurological disorders, learning and memory defects and a greater cancer risk. Effects are also being noticed in plant and animal life.\nThe scientists who signed the appeal represent the majority of scientific experts on non-ionizing radiation, who have published more than 2,000 papers and letters on the topic of EMF in professional journals among them.\nMoskowitz also takes issue with the fact that many working in the telecommunications industry and the government officials who they’ve brought over to their side label those who point out 5G’s dangers as fear mongerers. This is far from a conspiracy theory; this position is coming from a body of legitimate scientific research.\nHe said: “Since much of our research is publicly-funded, we believe it is our ethical responsibility to inform the public about what the peer-reviewed scientific literature tells us about the health risks from wireless radiation.”\nIn short, 5G can be likened to a “global human experiment without consent.” The very fact that Scientific American’s editorial board chose to print a piece that is so strongly against 5G shows that even the world’s most mainstream scientific publications have serious reservations about this technology – and that should be enough to make anyone question whether this technology should be used at all.\nSources for this article include:"}, {"claim": "Someone who couldn't afford health care under Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act gets penalized $10,000", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Refuted", "justification": "The 2nd Q&A pair point out that from 2019 there was no more penalty for having no health insurance in the US, whilst the claim was made in 2020.", "claim_date": "20-10-2020", "speaker": "Capitalism", "original_claim_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116144247/https://www.facebook.com/Capitalists/photos/a.226491315514/10164464788875515", "fact_checking_article": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116144247/https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2020/10/fact-check-trump-congress-did-end-theft-of-tax-penalty-for-non-insured-but-10000-penalty-not-likely.html", "reporting_source": "Facebook", "location_ISO_code": "US", "claim_types": ["Event/Property Claim"], "fact_checking_strategies": ["Written Evidence"], "questions": [{"question": "When was the claim made", "answers": [{"answer": "20/10/2020", "answer_type": "Extractive", "source_url": "Metadata", "source_medium": "Metadata"}]}, {"question": "What is the penalty for not having a health insurance in 2020", "answers": [{"answer": "From 2019, there was no more penalty for not having a health insurance", "answer_type": "Abstractive", "source_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210119152541/https://www.healthforcalifornia.com/covered-california/uninsured-penalty", "source_medium": "Web text"}]}], "orig_claim": "Trump, Congress Ended Theft Of Tax Penalty For Non-Insured, And Some Are Fined $10,000", "orig_verdict": "Misleading", "fulltext": "...."}, {"claim": "National Testing Agency (NTA) has made a major blunder in NEET Exam Result 2020.

Mridul then challenged the result declared by the NTA and after rechecking of the OMR sheet and Answer Key, it was found that he is an All India Topper in ST category.  The 17-year-old Rawat is a resident of Gangapur town of Sawai Madhopur district in Rajasthan. On October 16, when the NTA had declared the result, it gave Mridul 329 points in 720. But after rechecking it was found that Mridul has obtained 650 out of 720 marks.  According to Mridul, his All India rank in General Category is 3577.  However, a mistake was also spotted by Mridul in the second marksheet issued by the NTA. In the second marksheet, the sum of of his marks shows 650 but only three hundred twenty-nine were written in words.  In a first, two candidates attained full marks in NEET 2020 exams.

YOU make the work possible.\nPennsylvania rejects 372,000 mail-in ballots, leaving many voters confused: report\nOne voter was alleged to have submitted 11 duplicates\nBy: The Blaze, October 17, 2020:\nIn the immensely critical battleground state of Pennsylvania, approximately 372,000 mail-in ballots were rejected. The situation perplexed many voters, but officials say there is an explanation for the confusion.\nProPublica and the Philadelphia Inquirer co-published a report on Friday discovering that 372,000 mail-in ballots were rejected. Overall, one out of every five requests for mail-in ballots were rejected, according to the report.\nHowever, 90% of those mail-in ballots, about 336,000, were denied as duplicates.\nThe reason for the confusion is because people may have previously and unknowingly already requested a mail-in ballot for the November election.\nMany Pennsylvanians who voted during the June primaries may have checked a box to request a mail-in ballot for the November election. Many may have requested a second ballot unwittingly.\nThe attempt to promote mail-in voting in June amidst the coronavirus pandemic has caused administrative headaches for election officials preparing for the general election.\n“We basically have to treat them all the same,” Bill Turner, acting elections director for Chester County, said. “We’re taking a tremendous amount of staff time and effort only to find out it’s a duplicate.”\n“The volume of calls we have been getting has been overwhelming,” Marybeth Kuznik, elections director in Armstrong County, northeast of Pittsburgh, said. “It has been almost like a denial of service attack at times because it seemed that sometimes all I could get done was answer the phone!”\nMaking matters even worse, nongovernmental election groups have deluged Pennsylvania voters with mail-in ballot applications, urging voters to request mail-in ballots. Some voters assume these applications are from the state. They may think that their request for a mail-in ballot was not received by the government, so they request another mail-in ballot.\nA spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of State said these nongovernmental election groups have caused “confusion for voters and the likelihood that voters will not realize their application has been processed and they don’t need to submit another one.”\n“Voters have also been baffled by unclear or inaccurate information on the state’s ballot-tracking website, and by a wave of mail ballot applications from political parties and get-out-the-vote groups,” the report stated. “County offices across the state have been forced to hire temporary staff and work seven days a week to cope with the confusion.”\nThe report found that there were hundreds of voters who submitted three or more duplicate applications. One voter was alleged to have submitted 11 duplicates.\nThere are concerns that the confusion over the mail-in ballots could lead to voter disenfranchisement.\nOver 2.7 million Pennsylvanians have requested mail-in ballots for this election.\nAlso this week, nearly 30,000 mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania were sent to the wrong residences. “About 28,879 voters in Allegheny County, home to Pittsburgh, were impacted due to an error made by Midwest Direct, the company tasked with printing, collating and mailing the ballots,” as reported by Fox News.\nThe inaccurate mailed ballots were a result of a mapping error. Correct ballots began mailing out on Thursday.\nEarlier this week, over 100 mail-in ballots were found in a Kentucky dumpster. An investigation was opened by the U.S. Postal Service Office of the Inspector General, which led to a U.S. Postal Service employee being terminated.\nHave a tip we should know?

But not because of her religion.\nBarrett, 48, proved to be a Teflon nominee in 2017 for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit. Not only did she deflect Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein's concern that \"the dogma lives loudly within you,\" but her Catholic and conservative backers used the phrase on T-shirts, tote bags and coffee mugs in a sign of support.\nThis time, her nomination to the seat held for 27 years by Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg – a women's rights icon and the subject of far more paraphernalia – makes Barrett's nomination a potential turning point for the nation's judicial system.\nThe nominee acknowledged the moment in her remarks to a supportive crowd gathered in the White House Rose Garden. She paid homage to Ginsburg as \"a woman of enormous talent and consequence\" who \"not only broke glass ceilings, she smashed them.\"\nIf confirmed as Ginsburg's successor, she said, \"I would not assume that role for the sake of those in my own circle, and certainly not for my own sake. I would assume this role to serve you.\"\nNow rather than focusing on religion, opponents are warning of possible Supreme Court reversals on abortion, guns, health care and more.\nMore:Trump embraces political battle with pick of Amy Coney Barrett for Supreme Court\n\"Even in her short time on the bench, (Barrett) has very concerning rulings that relate to important issues, like protections for LGBTQ Americans, immigrants, the Affordable Care Act, and abortion rights,\" Elizabeth Wydra, president of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center, said earlier this week. \"So we should be concerned about this particular nominee.\"\nBut Barrett's allies and colleagues herald her as an almost perfect choice based on her judicial opinions, academic writings and personal life as the mother of seven children, all of whom accompanied her to the White House Saturday.\n\"She is a respected scholar, an award-winning teacher, a razor-sharp lawyer, a disciplined and diligent jurist, and a person of the highest character,\" Rick Garnett, founding director of Notre Dame Law School’s Program on Church, State, and Society, said in 2018 when Barrett competed for the nomination that went to Brett Kavanaugh.\nMore:Health care law faces another Supreme Court showdown, this time without Ginsburg's vote\nBarrett has been winning kudos like that for decades. Every living law clerk who worked at the Supreme Court during its 1998 term signed a letter in 2017 endorsing her appeals court nomination, including those who worked for liberal justices.\n\"Professor Barrett is a woman of remarkable intellect and character,\" the 34 former law clerks wrote. \"Based on our observations, we came to respect Professor Barrett’s conscientious work ethic, her respect for the law, and her remarkable legal abilities.\"\nThat popularity has been evident as well at Notre Dame Law School, where Barrett, an alumni, has been named professor of the year three times since 2002.\n\"She's mind-blowingly intelligent, and she's also one of the most humble people you're going to meet,\" said professor Stephen Yelderman, a recent law clerk for Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch. \"Judge Barrett is the complete package.\"\nAnd it is palpable in her South Bend, Ind., community, where she juggles judging, teaching and, with her husband Jesse, raising seven children, including two adopted from Haiti and one with special needs.\n“On a personal level, you’re amazing – to have seven children and do what you do,\" Feinstein marveled during Barrett's confirmation hearing in 2017.\nThat wasn't all she said.\nIn a dialogue that cemented Barrett's reputation among conservatives and defenders of religious freedom, Feinstein and other Democrats questioned whether the depth of Barrett's Catholic convictions might affect her rulings from the bench on issues such as abortion.\n\"If you're asking whether I take my faith seriously and I'm a faithful Catholic, I am,\" Barrett responded, \"although I would stress that my personal church affiliation or my religious belief would not bear in the discharge of my duties as a judge.\"\n'Kingdom of God'\nMore than a decade earlier in 2006, Barrett described her vision for being a \"different kind of lawyer.\"\nAddressing Notre Dame Law School's 2006 graduating class, she reminded the students that their legal careers are but a means to an end: namely, building the \"kingdom of God.\"\n\"If you can keep in mind that your fundamental purpose in life is not to be a lawyer, but to know, love and serve God, you truly will be a different kind of lawyer,\" she said.\nBarrett’s past membership in the religious group People of Praise has been scrutinized by national media outlets. The group dates to the early 1970s and grew out of the “charismatic” movement, sharing some traits of Protestant Pentecostal groups. It has about 1,700 adult members today.\nSome critics have suggested that its system of spiritual mentorship could raise questions of intellectual independence for Barrett on prospective cases. But Garnett said her participation in the group is “not so different from the lived religious experiences of millions of Americans.”\nFact check:'Kingdom of God' comment by Amy Coney Barrett lacks context in viral meme\nIf her religious views are less controversial this time around, her opinions and writings on abortion and other hot-button issues will take center stage.\nBarrett has written that Supreme Court precedents are not sacrosanct, which liberals have interpreted as a threat to the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide.\nMore:Supreme Court's split decision for abortion rights gives opponents an unlikely boost\nIn a 2013 Texas Law Review article exploring when the Supreme Court should overturn past decisions, Barrett wrote that she agrees \"with those who say that a justice’s duty is to the Constitution, and that it is thus more legitimate for her to enforce her best understanding of the Constitution rather than a precedent she thinks clearly in conflict with it.”\nShe also wrote that the public’s response to controversial cases like Roe v. Wade “reflects public rejection” of the idea that legal precedent “can declare a permanent victor in a divisive constitutional struggle.”\nMore:Casting aside its precedents, Supreme Court moves inexorably toward those on abortion rights\n'Value of human life'\nA former member of the University of Notre Dame’s “Faculty for Life,” Barrett signed a 2015 letter to Catholic bishops that affirmed the “teachings of the Church as truth.” Among those teachings: the “value of human life from conception to natural death” and marriage-family values “founded on the indissoluble commitment of a man and a woman.”\nThose views give anti-abortion groups hope that with her vote, the Supreme Court will uphold efforts by states to further restrict abortion rights – and potentially overrule Roe v. Wade some day.\n\"This is a turning point for the nation in the fight to protect its most vulnerable, the unborn,\" Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which opposes abortion, said upon Ginsburg's death last week.\nIn a 2013 speech at Notre Dame on the 40th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, Barrett said the ruling \"essentially permitted abortion on demand.\" But she declared it \"very unlikely\" the Supreme Court ever would overturn its core protection of abortion rights, according to coverage of her remarks in university publications.\n\"The fundamental element, that the woman has a right to choose abortion, will probably stand,\" the student newspaper The Observer quoted her saying. \"The controversy right now is about funding. It's a question of whether abortions will be publicly or privately funded.\"\nBeyond abortion, liberals are most concerned about Barrett's impact on health care, and specifically the Affordable Care Act. The law is coming before the court again in November, with Texas leading a group of states seeking to strike it down. If confirmed by the Senate before Election Day, she could be on the bench to hear that case a week later.\nBarrett wrote in 2017 that Chief Justice John Roberts pushed the law beyond its plausible meaning in order to save it. Roberts creatively interpreted as a tax the law’s penalty on those who don’t buy insurance, allowing the court to uphold the constitutionality of the law, she said.\nMore:Supreme Court once again will decide fate of Affordable Care Act\nShe also criticized the Obama administration’s method under the health care law for giving employees of religious-affiliated organizations access to birth control without having the institutions pay for it. Religiously-affiliated charities and universities were allowed to shift the cost on to their health insurance providers, but they argued that still left them involved.\nA letter Barrett and more than 300 academics signed said the accommodation “changes nothing of moral substance and fails to remove the assault on religious liberty.” The Supreme Court in July ultimately ruled those employers do not have to be involved in providing contraceptive coverage.\nMore:Supreme Court allows religious, moral exemptions for employers opposed to contraceptives\n'Impressive as they come'\nDuring her three years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, which includes Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin, Barrett has ruled in cases involving abortion, sexual assault, guns, race and immigration. Among them:\nAbortion: Barrett signed a dissent indicating she would have reheard Indiana's defense of a law banning abortions based on sex, race or disability. Indiana did not seek the appeals court's review, but the dissent nevertheless referred to \"eugenics\" and said \"none of the (Supreme) Court’s abortion decisions holds that states are powerless to prevent abortions designed to choose the sex, race, and other attributes of children.\" The high court later refused to consider the state's appeal.\nSexual assault: Barrett and two other judges reversed a lower court ruling and allowed a male student to sue Purdue University for suspending him after finding him guilty of sexual assault. The student's \"allegations raise a plausible inference that he was denied an educational benefit on the basis of his sex,\" she wrote.\nGuns: Barrett dissented when the court upheld a decision restricting the Second Amendment rights of a felon convicted of mail fraud. She said non-violent offenders should not lose their constitutional right to firearms possession.\nImmigration: In dissent, Barrett defended the Trump administration's rule denying immigrants permanent residence if they become regular users of public assistance.\nRace: Barrett helped to block the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's effort to stop an employer from transferring Chicago-area employees based on their race or ethnicity. The agency had accused AutoZone of making the transfers to reflect area demographics. Three dissenting judges said the policy \"deprived people ... of employment opportunities at their preferred geographic location.\"\nAge discrimination: Barrett ruled that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act does not apply when policies impact plaintiffs unintentionally. The ruling went against a 58-year-old job applicant who lost out to someone half his age when the company sought to hire a person with less than seven years' experience.\nMore:Supreme Court is shorthanded but could play role in election\nBarrett's opinions have won broad praise from conservative lawyers and academics. She is an adherent of originalism and textualism, judicial philosophies that teach judges should interpret the Constitution and legislation as written.\n“President Trump has again fulfilled his promise to appoint justices who are not only exceptionally qualified but willing to bravely stand up for the Constitution as it’s written and not bend to political pressures or personal preferences,\" said Leonard Leo, an adviser to the White House on judicial nominations who also serves as co-chairman of the conservative Federalist Society. \"Judge Barrett will be a great role model for future generations seeking to ensure that the rule of law advances the dignity of all people.”\n“In terms of intellectual caliber, she is as impressive as they come,\" said Jonathan Adler, a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, where Barrett spoke in 2019. \"The combination of intellect, poise, thoughtfulness and principle is really remarkable.”\nCajun cooking, child-rearing\nBarrett was born in New Orleans, from which she and her husband retain a penchant for Cajun cooking and Mardi Gras parties. The oldest of seven children, she graduated from Rhodes College in Tennessee before enrolling at Notre Dame Law School, from which she graduated first in her class in 1997.\n“My recollection is that she was quietly brilliant, reasonable, kind and a good person,\" recalled Tom Arkell, who graduated the same year. \"If there was one person in my class I would have expected to become a United States Supreme Court justice, it is Amy Coney Barrett.\"\nShe clerked for two renowned conservative jurists - Judge Laurence Silberman of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, then-Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia. It was during the latter clerkship that she earned the respect of her three dozen colleagues.\n“I remember being struck about how she commanded the room, and everyone respected her,” said Nicole Garnett, who clerked for Associate Justice Clarence Thomas the same term. “Even then, she stood out. And this was not a slouchy bunch.”\nHer liberal colleagues felt the same way. \"Measured subjectively and unscientifically by pure legal acumen, she was one of the two strongest lawyers,\" Harvard law professor Noah Feldman, who testified in favor of Trump's impeachment last year, wrote Saturday in a Bloomberg column.\nAfter working briefly in private practice, Barrett returned to Notre Dame to teach in 2002 and has been doing so ever since. For a class on evidence, Barrett referred students to the plot of \"My Cousin Vinny,\" a 1999 film in which two young friends from New York find themselves charged with murder and robbery in Alabama.\nRev. John Jenkins, Notre Dame's president, praised Barrett in a statement last week. \"The same impressive intellect, character and temperament that made Professor Barrett a successful nominee for the U.S. Court of Appeals would serve her equally well as a nominee for the nation's highest court,\" he said.\nBarrett's husband is a former federal prosecutor now working in private practice. They are the parents of four girls and three boys who smiled through Saturday's Rose Garden ceremony. Trump noted that if confirmed, Barrett would be the first mother of school-age children to serve on the high court.\n\"I'm better known back home as a room parent, carpool driver and birthday party planner,\" Barrett said.\nAs for their youngest child, Benjamin, who has Down syndrome, Barrett has spoken of facing \"unique challenges.\"\n\"But I think all you need to know about Benjamin's place in the family is summed up by the fact that the other children unreservedly identify him as their favorite sibling,\" she said in 2017 – and repeated almost verbatim Saturday.\nIn a 2018 law school graduation speech at Notre Dame after being chosen by students as distinguished professor of the year for the third time, Barrett emphasized that the law is intended to serve everyday Americans.\n“Diseases are named after the doctors who identify them. … But cases are different,\" she said. \"Cases are not named after the lawyers who litigated them, or the judges who decided them, but after the people on whom they had the greatest effect.”\nContributing: Kevin McCoy, Nick Penzenstadler and Michael Collins, USA TODAY; Caleb Bauer, Margaret Fosmoe and Christian Sheckler, South Bend Tribune"}, {"claim": "Daughters of President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo brought about the dissolution of Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Refuted", "justification": "president of Nigeria Muhammadu Buhari dissolved the notorious Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) - no mention on his daughter or Vice President Yemi Osinbajo daughter.", "claim_date": "12-10-2020", "speaker": "", "original_claim_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201101095614/https://authorityngr.com/2020/10/12/how-buhari-osinbajos-daughters-brought-sars-down/", "fact_checking_article": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201101141912/https://dubawa.org/misleading-newspaper-report-claims-daughters-of-buhari-osinbajo-facilitated-dissolution-of-sars/", "reporting_source": "Authority Newspaper", "location_ISO_code": "NG", "claim_types": ["Event/Property Claim"], "fact_checking_strategies": ["Written Evidence", "Consultation"], "questions": [{"question": "Who dissolved the notorious Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in Nigeria?", "answers": [{"answer": "executive order (from president of Nigeria Muhammadu Buhari)", "answer_type": "Abstractive", "source_url": "https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-54501013", "source_medium": "Web text"}]}], "orig_claim": "Daughters of Buhari and Osnibajo facilitated the dissolution of SARS", "orig_verdict": "Misleading", "fulltext": "*Investigates rights violation by defunct SARS\n*IGP acted courageously, says NHRC\nBy Hassan Zaggi\nUnknown to Nigerians, the daughters of President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, brought the pressure that led to the final disbandment of the notorious Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).\nZarah Buhari and Kiki Osinbajo, were in the fore among Nigerian influencers who kicked against the abominable acts of the defunct SARS.\nThe two young ladies had through their separate Instagram accounts thrown support for the campaign to end brutality against citizens traced to the unit.\nNigerians have for long mounted #EndSARS campaign, providing verifiable evidence of brutality, extra-judicial killing, torture and all forms of inhuman treatment meted on fellow Nigerians by SARS operatives, who dressed more like armed bandits, than wear any official anti-crime paraphernalia.\nAlthough the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, had penultimate week announced the disbandment, he immediately reinstated the ban through a statement by the Force Public Relations Officer (FPRO), DCP Frank Mba, but succumbed to pressure and again personally issued a statement disbanding the notorious unit yesterday.\nTwo of his predecessors had three times in the past disbanded SARS, but the notorious outfit swung back almost immediately, fueling speculation that the last has not yet been heard of the dreaded police unit.\nIn mounting pressure for the outfit to be kicked out, Kiki Osinbajo had posted a picture on her Instagram handle showing a clenched fist with the caption, “POLICE BRUTALITY MUST END NOW. #endpolicebrutality #endsars”.\nOn her part, Zahra Buhari applied several tags supportive of the anti-SARS campaign on her handle.\nThe Reaction of the two ladies has, however, elicited mixed reactions with some Nigerians taunting them on their relationship with the President and the Vice-President.\nConversely, they also got support from people who drew a boundary between their actions and that of their fathers respectively.\nFor instance: a_bas_sido wrote: “Do you discuss how bad the country is to your dad ?”; cowgirlpolyy wrote: “U better off comment session lol”; aka_akp wrote: “Tell your papa to end am, your papa Dey rule Nonsense”; odutayosamiat wrote: “She has the right to post whatever she likes!

The current agitation, in this context, is seen as a manifestation of the natural desire of citizens to participate in matters concerning policing and internal security in the nation. This is indeed one of the fundamental principles of Community Policing, which we are currently implementing”.\nHe said that a “Citizens and Strategic Stakeholders’ Forum will be formed to regularly interface with the leadership of the police at all levels and advice on police activities”.\nHe added that “an investigation team will be constituted which will include civil society organisations for transparency, and culprits will be punished”.\n*IGP acted courageously, says NHRC\nReacting to the development, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has commended the “courage and display of mark of a listening government through the disbandment of SARS by the Federal Government”.\nIn a statement by the Executive Secretary, Barr. Tony Ojukwu, the commission said that “in line with its mandate of promoting, protecting and enforcing human rights in Nigeria, the NHRC has been monitoring reports from individual victims and the media with respect to human rights violation of innocent members of the public by operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) as well as other police units across the country.\n“The Commission is equally aware of the public outcry to scrap SARS so as to put an end to these violations which has now been met by the Federal Government as a mark of its commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights of Nigerians.\nHe commended the federal government who he said, “responded to public outcry against human rights violations by SARS in constituting a special Presidential investigation panel with a broad-based membership including the civil society to investigate these allegations and make appropriate recommendations to sanction any SARS operatives found to have violated human rights of members of the public and to also suggest measures to reform SARS.\n“With the initial and right step to disband SARS by the IGP as part of the recommendations of the Presidential Panel, the stage is now set to implement the other recommendations of the panel and in this regard, the government had requested the Commission to constitute a broad based implementation committee inclusive of relevant government agencies and civil society organizations to ensure the transparent, comprehensive and accountable implementation of the white paper on the presidential panel report.\n“The Commission assures Nigerians that the federal government is wholly committed to protecting the human rights of all Nigerians in accordance with the 1999 Constitution as amended, Nigeria’s international human rights obligations and respect for the rule of law”.\nHe urged Nigerian to appreciate the sacrifices made by SARS “in bursting armed robbery and other heinous crimes in the country even at the risk of their personal safety and some of them have paid the supreme sacrifice too”.\nHe insisted that the SARS/police officers tarnishing the image of government and the police force should be made to be accountable.\n3 comments\nMY DEAR!!!

Trump.\nSon auditoire, que ce soit sur Facebook ou sur YouTube – où sa chaîne compte 120 000 abonnés –, a pris beaucoup d'ampleur depuis l'éclatement de la pandémie.\nIl est ainsi devenu une figure de proue au sein du mouvement visant à protester contre les règles sanitaires québécoises, notamment le port obligatoire du couvre-visage dans les commerces et le transport collectif.\nM. Cossette-Trudel s'est aussi exprimé lors de diverses manifestations antimasques, en plus d'être invité sur les ondes de CHOI FM, une station de radio de Québec dont plusieurs animateurs sont opposés au port obligatoire du masque dans certains lieux.\nFacebook dit avoir récemment agi pour limiter l'influence de Radio-Québec, y compris en retirant à M. Cossette-Trudel la capacité d'en monétiser le contenu, ainsi qu'en restreignant les endroits où son réseau apparaît dans les résultats de recherche.\nLors d'une entrevue donnée mardi, avant que son compte Facebook ne soit fermé, M. Cossette-Trudel a soutenu que les restrictions tenaient de la\ncensure, et a accusé Facebook d'être\nle chien de garde des puissants.\nIl a assuré par ailleurs avoir cessé de faire directement référence à QAnon il y a plusieurs mois, et soutient ne jamais avoir fait l'apologie de la violence.\nToujours lors de son entrevue, il a cependant indiqué toujours croire les déclarations de Q, le supposé responsable au sein du gouvernement américain qui serait au fait des divers complots contre M.

He held a press conference with several other doctors at Walter Reed Medical Center.

Behind me are some of the members of the President’s medical team whom I’d like to introduce: Dr. Sean Dooley, Pulmonary Critical Care, Dr. Brian Garibaldi, Pulmonary Critical Care, Dr. Robert Browning, Pulmonary Critical Care, Dr. Jason Blaylock, Infectious Disease, Dr Wes Campbell, Infectious Disease, Dr John Hodgson, Anesthesia, Major Kirt Cline, Army Nurse, Commander Megan Nasworthy, Navy Nurse, Lieutenant Juliana Levopa, Navy Nurse, Lieutenant Commander John Shea, Clinical Pharmacist, and not present with us are, Lieutenant Beth Carter, Lieutenant Maureen Mehan, both Navy Nurses, and Dr. Jesse Shownow, Director of our executive medicine program.\nDr. Sean Conley: (01:07)\nAs reported yesterday, consultation with this group, I recommended we bring the President up to Walter Reed as a precautionary measure to provide state-of-the-art monitoring and any care that he may need. Just 72 hours into the diagnosis now, the first week of COVID, and in particular day seven to 10 are the most critical in determining the likely course of this illness.\nDr. Sean Conley: (01:32)\nAt this time, the team and I are extremely happy with the progress the President has made. Thursday he had a mild cough, and some nasal congestion, and fatigue, all of which are now resolving and improving. At this time, I’d like to bring up Dr. Dooley to discuss some of the specifics of the President’s care.\nDr. Dooley: (01:53)\nThank you, and good afternoon. I’m Dr. Sean Dooley, as Dr. Conley mentioned. I’ll start off by mentioning how incredibly proud I am of our medical team assembled behind me, and the honor it has been to care for the President over these last 24 hours here at Walter Reed.\nDr. Dooley: (02:13)\nHe’s receiving outstanding multidisciplinary care, the state of the science for coronavirus infection. We are monitoring him very closely for any evidence of complications from either the coronavirus illness or the therapies that we are prescribing to make him better.\nDr. Dooley: (02:34)\nWe have monitored his cardiac function, his kidney function, his liver function, all of those are normal. And the President this morning is not on oxygen, not having difficulty breathing or walking around the White House Medical Unit upstairs. He’s in exceptionally good spirits. And in fact, as we were completing our multidisciplinary rounds this morning, the quote he left with was, “I feel like I could walk out of here today.” And that was a very encouraging comment from the President.\nDr. Dooley: (03:06)\nMoving forward, I’ll go ahead and introduce Dr. Garibaldi, who will talk about some of our therapeutics and the plan of care for today. Thank you.\nDr. Garibaldi: (03:17)\nThank you, Dr. Dooley. And I’d like to echo the sentiment from the entire team, what a honor and a privilege that is to be part of this multidisciplinary unit to care for the President.\nDr. Garibaldi: (03:26)\nAbout 48 hours ago, the President received a special antibody therapy directed against the coronavirus, and we’re working very closely with the company to monitor him in terms of that outcome. Yesterday evening, he received his first dose of IV Remdesivir. And our plan is to continue a five day treatment course for Remdesivir. The big plan for today, since he’s in such great spirits and doing well, is to encourage him to eat, to drink, to stay hydrated, to be up out of bed, and to be working and doing the things that he needs to do to get well.\nDr. Garibaldi: (03:58)\nI’ll refer Dr. Conley to any question.s\nDr. Sean Conley: (04:02)\nThanks, Brian.\nDr. Sean Conley: (04:03)\nIt’s important to note the President’s been fever free for over 24 hours. We remain cautiously optimistic, but he’s doing great. With that… Oh, one other note, it should be clear that he’s got plenty of work to get done from the Chief of Staff. And he’s doing it.\nDr. Sean Conley: (04:23)\nWith that, if there’s a couple of questions about the President’s health in the last couple of days.\nSpeaker 5: (04:27)\nSir, could you tell us the President’s optimal saturation level, please?\nDr. Sean Conley: (04:31)\nYeah. So the last saturation that we had, up walking around, he was about 96%.\nSpeaker 5: (04:37)\nAnd he has not received any supplemental oxygen?\nDr. Sean Conley: (04:40)\nHe’s not on oxygen right now. That’s right.\nSpeaker 5: (04:45)\nHe has not received any at all?\nDr. Sean Conley: (04:46)\nHe’s not needed any this morning today at all. That’s right. Now he’s-\nSpeaker 6: (04:52)\nDo you have an estimated date when he might be discharged?\nDr. Sean Conley: (04:56)\nWell, I don’t want to put a hard date on that. He’s doing so well, but with a known course of the illness, day seven to 10 we get really concerned about the inflammatory phase, phase two. Given that we provided some of these advanced therapies so early in the course, a little bit earlier than most of the patients we know and follow, it’s hard to tell where he is on that course. And so, every day we’re evaluating, does he need to be here? What does he need? And where’s he going?\nSpeaker 7: (05:28)\nWhat do you see as the probability that he will need supplemental oxygen going forward?\nDr. Sean Conley: (05:32)\nI don’t want to put a percentage on that, but right now all indicators are that he’ll remain off of oxygen going forward.\nSpeaker 7: (05:40)\nAnd in terms of blood clots, pneumonia, bacterial infection, what do you see is the risk on that front?\nDr. Sean Conley: (05:47)\nWell, we know that all of them are risks associated with this condition. He is receiving all of the standard of care, and beyond, per routine international COVID protocols. We’re monitoring for all of that, but at the moment there’s no cause for concern.\nSpeaker 8: (06:07)\nYou said he’s fever free now, what was his fever when he had one, sir?\nDr. Sean Conley: (06:12)\nI’d rather not give any specific numbers, but he did have a fever Thursday into Friday. And since Friday morning, he’s had none.\nSpeaker 9: (06:20)\nAnd was the date- [crosstalk 00:06:21].\nSpeaker 10: (06:21)\n… on top of the other antibodies?\nDr. Sean Conley: (06:23)\nI’m sorry?\nSpeaker 10: (06:24)\nWhy Remdesivir on top of the antibodies?\nDr. Sean Conley: (06:27)\nRemdesivir works a little bit differently than the antibodies. We are maximizing all aspects of his care, attacking this virus in a multi-pronged approach. As the President, I didn’t want to hold anything back. If there was any possibility that it would add value to his care, and expedite has return, I wanted to take it. And the team agreed, and that’s what we proceeded.\nSpeaker 9: (06:53)\nDoctor, what was the date of the President’s last negative test?\nDr. Sean Conley: (06:56)\nI’m not going to get into all the testing going back, but he, and all the staff routinely are tested, and so…\nSpeaker 11: (07:06)\nDoctor, what is the PPE protocol for President Trump receiving visitors and doctors?\nDr. Sean Conley: (07:11)\nIt’s the same as any hospital has. We have an area that’s clean that you put your equipment on. And then beyond that, everybody is fully gowned up, masks, gloves. We’re protecting ourselves and him.\nSpeaker 12: (07:27)\nHave you done a screen, has there’s been any sign of any lung damage whatsoever?\nDr. Sean Conley: (07:30)\nWe are we’re following all of that. We do daily ultrasounds, we do daily lab work. The team is tracking all of that.\nSpeaker 12: (07:37)\nHas there been any sign of damage, sir? [crosstalk 00:07:38].\nDr. Sean Conley: (07:38)\nI’m not going to go into specifics of what the findings of any of that are.\nSpeaker 12: (07:41)\nCan we just pin you down on one thing? Has he ever been on supplemental oxygen?\nDr. Sean Conley: (07:46)\nRight now, he is not on oxygen.\nSpeaker 12: (07:48)\nI know you keep saying right now, but should we read into the fact that he had been previously?\nDr. Sean Conley: (07:51)\nYesterday and today, he was not on oxygen.\nSpeaker 13: (07:53)\nSo he has not been on it during his COVID treatment? Is that accurate.\nDr. Sean Conley: (07:57)\nHe’s not on oxygen right now.\nSpeaker 14: (07:58)\nHas hydroxychloroquine been considered as a viable treatment option for the President?\nDr. Sean Conley: (08:02)\nWe discussed it. He asked about it. He’s not on it now.\nSpeaker 15: (08:06)\nDoctor, what symptoms, has he also experienced difficulty breathing?\nDr. Sean Conley: (08:10)\nNo. No, he has not, never did. He had a little cough, he had the fever, more than anything he’s felt run down.\nSpeaker 16: (08:17)\nWho is handling contact tracing? Is that the White House or CDC?\nDr. Sean Conley: (08:21)\nThe White House Medical Unit, in collaboration with CDC and local State and Health Departments are conducting all contact tracing per CDC guidelines.\nSpeaker 17: (08:32)\nWhen was the positive diagnosis made? You said 72 hours. That would put it that Wednesday.\nDr. Sean Conley: (08:37)\nYeah. So Thursday afternoon, following the news of a close contact is when we repeated testing. And given clinical indications, I had a little bit more concern. And that’s when, late that night, we got the PCR confirmation that he was.\nSpeaker 18: (08:57)\nIs there any clarity on how he became infected?\nDr. Sean Conley: (08:59)\nI’m not going to go into that. As far as his care, it’s irrelevant.\nSpeaker 18: (09:05)\nOr when he became infected?\nDr. Sean Conley: (09:07)\nYeah. We’re not going to go into that. We’re just tracking his a clinical course and providing the best care we can.\nSpeaker 19: (09:13)\nWill President Trump have to stay at Walter Reed to get the five days Remdesivir treatment?\nDr. Sean Conley: (09:18)\nWe’ve discussed that. Right now, if he needs all five days, that will likely be the course. But again, every day we’re reviewing with the team his needs for being here. And as soon as he gets to the point where it’s not a requirement, he may still need some care, but if we can provide that downtown, at the house, then we will transition at that point, as long as it’s safe and appropriate and the team agrees.\nSpeaker 20: (09:43)\nIn addition to his weight, does he have any other risk factors that make him more at risk for a severe case?\nDr. Sean Conley: (09:50)\nNot particularly. He’s 74, he’s male, and he is slightly overweight. Other than that, he’s very healthy. His cholesterol is great. His blood pressure is great. He’s not on medication for that. He’s up and active. And you saw his activity the days leading up to, the long hours and everything else, he’s able to handle it.\nSpeaker 21: (10:12)\nCan you provide other vitals, like heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature?\nDr. Sean Conley: (10:18)\nHis heart rate is in the 70s-80s, his blood pressure has remained where it’s historically been during our physicals, 110 to 120 is his top. He’s great. It’s never budged. I’ve had no concerns there.\nSpeaker 22: (10:33)\nSo why was the decision made to transfer him here?\nDr. Sean Conley: (10:35)\nBecause he’s the President of the United States.\nSpeaker 22: (10:37)\nAnd obviously, doctors had found that the prone position is helpful for COVID, has he been in that at all?\nDr. Sean Conley: (10:42)\nNo, we actually, he asked about that. He did, Thursday into Friday. He’s been briefed by the task force and all the scientists for months. And he brought that up, as we were discussing his cough. And at that time his oxygen levels were okay, and we didn’t feel like we needed to do it. We came up here, we discussed it with the team as well. We consider all options, but he has not needed any of that.\nSpeaker 23: (11:04)\nWhy wasn’t the first lady admitted as well?\nDr. Sean Conley: (11:07)\nThe First Lady’s doing great. Thanks for asking. She has no indication for hospitalization advanced therapy. She’s convalescing at home. Thank you.\nSpeaker 12: (11:16)\nI’m going to try to pin you down one more time. I know you said there was no oxygen yesterday and today, does that mean he-\nDr. Sean Conley: (11:20)\nYeah, he’s not on oxygen today-\nSpeaker 12: (11:22)\nBut did he receive any on Thursday?\nDr. Sean Conley: (11:24)\nAnd he’s.. What’s today? Saturday?\nSpeaker 12: (11:25)\nToday’s Saturday.\nDr. Sean Conley: (11:26)\nNo, no, Thursday-\nSpeaker 12: (11:28)\nOka, so no Thursday, no Friday, no Saturday. That’s fine. That was why we were confused.\nDr. Sean Conley: (11:30)\nSo Thursday, no oxygen. None at this moment. And yesterday, with the team a while, while we were all here, he was not on oxygen.\nSpeaker 12: (11:38)\nThank you.\nSpeaker 24: (11:39)\nHas the President actually been admitted as a patient to this hospital?\nDr. Sean Conley: (11:44)\nThe President is a patient that Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.\nSpeaker 25: (11:49)\nIs he on any steroids?\nDr. Sean Conley: (11:51)\nChief.\nSpeaker 26: (11:51)\nPress, thank you.\nDr. Sean Conley: (11:53)\nThank you, very much. [crosstalk 00:11:53]\nSpeaker 27: (11:53)\nThank you guys.\nSpeaker 27: (11:53)\nOkay, thank you."}, {"claim": "US President Donald Trump's positive COVID-19 result is a false positive, which could allow an adversary in the White House to poison the president’s soda and later say that he suffered from COVID-19.", "required_reannotation": true, "label": "Refuted", "justification": "I have labelled as refuted as the tests were deemed to be true positives and not false.

As President, I wish to renew my appreciation to Nigerians for entrusting me with your hopes and aspirations for a better and greater Nigeria.\n2. Today, it is my unique privilege to re-commit myself to the service of this great country of great people with profound diversities and opportunities. We are bound by destiny to be the largest and greatest black nation on earth.\n3. At this stage in our nationhood it is important that we reflect how we got here to enable us work TOGETHER to get to where we aspire to be as a strong indivisible nation, united in hope and equal in opportunity.\n4. On October 1st 1960 when Prime Minister Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa received the constitutional instruments symbolizing Nigeria’s independence, he expressed his wish that having acquired our rightful status as an independent sovereign nation, history would record that the building of our nation proceeded at the wisest pace.\n5. This optimism was anchored on the peaceful planning, full and open consultation and harmonious cooperation with the different groups which culminated in Nigeria emerging as a country without bitterness and bloodshed.\n6. Our founding fathers understood the imperative of structuring a National identity using the power of the state and worked towards unification of Nigerians in a politically stable and viable entity.\n7. That philosophy guided the foundation that was laid for our young nation of 45 million people with an urban population of approximately 7million occupying an area of 910,768 square kilometers. These demographics led to development challenges for which major efforts were made to overcome.\n8. Today, we grapple with multiple challenges with a population exceeding 200million occupying the same land mass but 52% residing in urban areas.\n9. Sixty years of nationhood provides an opportunity to ask ourselves questions on the extent to which we have sustained the aspirations of our founding fathers. Where did we do the right things? Are we on course? If not where did we stray and how can we remedy and retrace our steps?\n10. Upon attaining independence, Nigeria’s growth trajectory was anchored on policies and programmes that positively impacted on all sectors of the economy. However, this journey was cut short by the 30-months of civil war.\n11. We came out of the civil war with a focus on reconstruction, rehabilitation and reconciliation that enabled the country to put in place world-class development structures and a strengthened public service that well served the government. This positive trajectory continued with a return to democratic government which was truncated by another round of military rule.\n12. For a cumulative 29 of our 60 years existence as a nation, we have been under military rule.\n13. My summary of our journey so far as a nation is necessary to appropriately chart where we need to go and how to get there TOGETHER.\n14. Today, I am aware that our economy along with every single economy in the world is in crisis. We still face security challenges in parts of the country, while our society suffers from a high loss of moral rectitude which is driven by unbridled craving for political control.\n15. An underlying cause of most of the problems we have faced as a nation is our consistent harping on artificially contrived fault-lines that we have harboured and allowed unnecessarily to fester.\n16. In addition, institutions such as civil service, police, the judiciary, the military all suffered from a general decline.\n17. We need to begin a sincere process of national healing and this anniversary presents a genuine opportunity to eliminate old and outworn perceptions that are always put to test in the lie they always are.\n18. The stereotype of thinking of ourselves as coming from one part of the country before seeing ourselves as Nigerians is a key starting point to project us on the road to our deserved nation’s evolution and integration.\n19. To start this healing process, we are already blessed with the most important asset any nation requires for such – OUR PEOPLE – and this has manifested globally in the exploits of Nigerians in many fields.\n20. It has been demonstrated time and time again that Nigerians in the diaspora frequently excel in science, technology, medicine, sports, arts and many other fields.\n21. Similarly, the creativity, ingenuity and resourcefulness of the Nigerian at home have resulted in globally recognized endeavours.\n22. I am convinced that if we pursue our aspirations TOGETHER we would be able to achieve whatever we desire. That informed our adopting the theme TOGETHER to mark this epochal event.\n23. Together we can change our condition for the better and more importantly, together we can do much more for ourselves and for our country.\n24. I chose the path of self-reflection because this is what I do on a daily basis and I must confess that at most times, I always felt the need for a collective reflection as I know that the foundation for a solid future which this administration is laying can only be sustainable if there is a collective commitment by Nigerians.\n25. Nigeria is not a country for Mr. President, any ruling or opposition party but a country for all of us and we must play our part, irrespective of challenges we face, to make this country what we desire.\n26. To achieve this, we must focus our minds, TOGETHER as a people, on ways of resolving the identified critical challenges that underlie our present state. These include:\na. Evolving and sustaining a democratic culture that leaves power in the hands of the people;\nb. Supporting the enthronement of the rule of law, demanding accountability of elected representatives and contributing to good governance;\nc. Increasing our commitment to peaceful co-existence in a peaceful, secure and united Nigeria;\nd. Harnessing and Optimizing our tremendous human and natural resources to attain our goal of being in the top twenty economies of the world and in the process;\ne. Lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years;\nf. Strengthening institutions to make them stronger in protecting National Interests; and\ng. Imbibing tolerance in diversity.\n27. I am a firm believer in transparent, free, fair and credible elections as has been demonstrated during my period as a democratically elected President.\n28. The recent build-up and eventual outcome of the Edo State elections should encourage Nigerians that it is my commitment to bequeath to this country processes and procedures that would guarantee that the people’s votes count.\n29. The problems with our electoral process are mainly human induced as desperate desire for power leads to desperate attempts to gain power and office.\n30. Democracy, the world over and as I am pursuing in Nigeria, recognizes the power of the people. However, if some constituencies choose to bargain off their power, they should be prepared for denial of their rights.\n31. This call is made more urgent if we realise that even after a transparent, free, fair and credible election, desperation leads to compromising the judiciary to upturn legitimate decisions of the people.\n32. It is necessary to, therefore support the enthronement of the rule of law by avoiding actions which compromise the judiciary.\n33. Fellow Nigerians, our history has shown that we are a people that have the capacity to live peacefully with one another.\n34. As a government, we remain committed to our constitutional oath of securing the lives and properties of the citizenry. I, however, call on the citizenry to also support government by providing the necessary community level intelligence in addressing these challenges.\n35. In moving forward together, it is important to strengthen our economy to provide sustainable means of livelihood for as many Nigerians as possible so as to eradicate absolute poverty from our midst.\n36. I want to re-emphasize my dedication and commitment, a dedication and commitment that propelled my public service career and informed my quest to continually seek for an opportunity to improve the lives of Nigerians, set the country on the path of prosperity and lead the country to a better future.\n37. This administration has been focused on rebuilding and laying the foundations for a sustainable Nigeria. Of course, we have met and are still meeting the challenges inherent in any rebuilding initiative – more so that of a nation like Nigeria that has undergone avoidable levels of deprivation – but can be surmounted if we all work together.\n38. I wish to re-iterate that our people and our spirit of excellence remains our most important asset.\n39. In this wise, the need to return to our age-old ethical and high moral values would be necessary and this informed my launching of the National Ethics and Integrity Policy on Monday 28th September, 2020.\n40. The policy would not implement itself and the first contact of the visibility of its implementation is the Public Service whose on-going reforms would be expected to be sustainable and give a radical re-direction in providing services to all Nigerians.\n41. Fellow Nigerians, in addition to public health challenges of working to contain the spread of the Coronavirus, we have suffered a significant drop in our foreign exchange earnings and internal revenues due to 40 per cent drop in oil prices and steep drop in economic activities, leading to a 60 per cent drop in government revenue.\n42. Our government is grappling with the dual challenge of saving lives and livelihoods in face of drastically reduced resources.\n43. In this regard, sustaining the level of petroleum prices is no longer possible. The government, since coming into office has recognized the economic argument for adjusting the price of petroleum. But the social argument about the knock-on effect of any adjustment weighed heavily with the government.\n44. Accordingly, in the last three years, we have introduced unprecedented measures in support of the economy and to the weakest members of our society in the shape of:\na. Tradermoni\nb. Farmermoni\nc. School Feeding Programme\nd. Job creation efforts\ne. Agricultural intervention programmes\n45. No government in the past did what we are doing with such scarce resources. We have managed to keep things going in spite of the disproportionate spending on security. Those in the previous Governments from 1999 – 2015 who presided over the near destruction of the country have now the impudence to attempt to criticize our efforts.\n46. In the circumstances, a responsible government must face realities and take tough decisions.\n47. Petroleum prices in Nigeria are to be adjusted. We sell now at N161 per litre. A comparison with our neighbours will illustrate the point;\na. Chad which is an oil producing country charges N362 per litre\nb. Niger, also an oil producing country sells 1 litre at N346.\nc. In Ghana, another oil producing country, petroleum pump price is N326 per litre.\n48. Further afield, Egypt charges N211 per litre. Saudi Arabia charges N168 per litre. It makes no sense for oil to be cheaper in Nigeria than in Saudi Arabia.\n49. Fellow Nigerians, to achieve the great country we desire, we need to solidify our strength, increase our commitment and encourage ourselves to do that which is right and proper even when no one is watching.\n50. Fellow Nigerians, let us collectively resolve to continue our journey beyond the sixty years on the clear understanding that as a nation we are greater together than being smaller units of nationalities. By the special grace of God we shall come through any transient challenges.\n51. It is my sincere hope that by the end of this anniversary on September 30th 2021, we will all be proud of taking this individual and collective self-assessment for the progress of our great Nation.\nLong Live the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\nGod Bless us all.

As President, I wish to renew my appreciation to Nigerians for entrusting me with your hopes and aspirations for a better and greater Nigeria.\n2. Today, it is my unique privilege to re-commit myself to the service of this great country of great people with profound diversities and opportunities. We are bound by destiny to be the largest and greatest black nation on earth.\n3. At this stage in our nationhood it is important that we reflect how we got here to enable us work TOGETHER to get to where we aspire to be as a strong indivisible nation, united in hope and equal in opportunity.\n4. On October 1st 1960 when Prime Minister Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa received the constitutional instruments symbolizing Nigeria’s independence, he expressed his wish that having acquired our rightful status as an independent sovereign nation, history would record that the building of our nation proceeded at the wisest pace.\n5. This optimism was anchored on the peaceful planning, full and open consultation and harmonious cooperation with the different groups which culminated in Nigeria emerging as a country without bitterness and bloodshed.\n6. Our founding fathers understood the imperative of structuring a National identity using the power of the state and worked towards unification of Nigerians in a politically stable and viable entity.\n7. That philosophy guided the foundation that was laid for our young nation of 45 million people with an urban population of approximately 7million occupying an area of 910,768 square kilometers.

But the social argument about the knock-on effect of any adjustment weighed heavily with the government.\n44.

School Feeding Programme\nd. Job creation efforts\ne. Agricultural intervention programmes\n45. No government in the past did what we are doing with such scarce resources. We have managed to keep things going in spite of the disproportionate spending on security. Those in the previous Governments from 1999 – 2015 who presided over the near destruction of the country have now the impudence to attempt to criticize our efforts.\n46. In the circumstances, a responsible government must face realities and take tough decisions.\n47. Petroleum prices in Nigeria are to be adjusted. We sell now at N161 per litre. A comparison with our neighbours will illustrate the point;\na. Chad which is an oil producing country charges N362 per litre\nb. Niger, also an oil producing country sells 1 litre at N346.\nc.

It makes no sense for oil to be cheaper in Nigeria than in Saudi Arabia.\n49. Fellow Nigerians, to achieve the great country we desire, we need to solidify our strength, increase our commitment and encourage ourselves to do that which is right and proper even when no one is watching.\n50. Fellow Nigerians, let us collectively resolve to continue our journey beyond the sixty years on the clear understanding that as a nation we are greater together than being smaller units of nationalities.

As President, I wish to renew my appreciation to Nigerians for entrusting me with your hopes and aspirations for a better and greater Nigeria.\n2. Today, it is my unique privilege to re-commit myself to the service of this great country of great people with profound diversities and opportunities. We are bound by destiny to be the largest and greatest black nation on earth.\n3. At this stage in our nationhood it is important that we reflect how we got here to enable us work TOGETHER to get to where we aspire to be as a strong indivisible nation, united in hope and equal in opportunity.\n4. On October 1st 1960 when Prime Minister Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa received the constitutional instruments symbolizing Nigeria’s independence, he expressed his wish that having acquired our rightful status as an independent sovereign nation, history would record that the building of our nation proceeded at the wisest pace.\n5. This optimism was anchored on the peaceful planning, full and open consultation and harmonious cooperation with the different groups which culminated in Nigeria emerging as a country without bitterness and bloodshed.\n6. Our founding fathers understood the imperative of structuring a National identity using the power of the state and worked towards unification of Nigerians in a politically stable and viable entity.\n7. That philosophy guided the foundation that was laid for our young nation of 45 million people with an urban population of approximately 7million occupying an area of 910,768 square kilometers. These demographics led to development challenges for which major efforts were made to overcome.\n8. Today, we grapple with multiple challenges with a population exceeding 200million occupying the same land mass but 52% residing in urban areas.\n9. Sixty years of nationhood provides an opportunity to ask ourselves questions on the extent to which we have sustained the aspirations of our founding fathers. Where did we do the right things? Are we on course? If not where did we stray and how can we remedy and retrace our steps?\n10. Upon attaining independence, Nigeria’s growth trajectory was anchored on policies and programmes that positively impacted on all sectors of the economy. However, this journey was cut short by the 30-months of civil war.\n11. We came out of the civil war with a focus on reconstruction, rehabilitation and reconciliation that enabled the country to put in place world-class development structures and a strengthened public service that well served the government. This positive trajectory continued with a return to democratic government which was truncated by another round of military rule.\n12. For a cumulative 29 of our 60 years existence as a nation, we have been under military rule.\n13. My summary of our journey so far as a nation is necessary to appropriately chart where we need to go and how to get there TOGETHER.\n14. Today, I am aware that our economy along with every single economy in the world is in crisis. We still face security challenges in parts of the country, while our society suffers from a high loss of moral rectitude which is driven by unbridled craving for political control.\n15. An underlying cause of most of the problems we have faced as a nation is our consistent harping on artificially contrived fault-lines that we have harboured and allowed unnecessarily to fester.\n16. In addition, institutions such as civil service, police, the judiciary, the military all suffered from a general decline.\n17. We need to begin a sincere process of national healing and this anniversary presents a genuine opportunity to eliminate old and outworn perceptions that are always put to test in the lie they always are.\n18. The stereotype of thinking of ourselves as coming from one part of the country before seeing ourselves as Nigerians is a key starting point to project us on the road to our deserved nation’s evolution and integration.\n19. To start this healing process, we are already blessed with the most important asset any nation requires for such – OUR PEOPLE – and this has manifested globally in the exploits of Nigerians in many fields.\n20. It has been demonstrated time and time again that Nigerians in the diaspora frequently excel in science, technology, medicine, sports, arts and many other fields.\n21. Similarly, the creativity, ingenuity and resourcefulness of the Nigerian at home have resulted in globally recognized endeavours.\n22. I am convinced that if we pursue our aspirations TOGETHER we would be able to achieve whatever we desire. That informed our adopting the theme TOGETHER to mark this epochal event.\n23. Together we can change our condition for the better and more importantly, together we can do much more for ourselves and for our country.\n24. I chose the path of self-reflection because this is what I do on a daily basis and I must confess that at most times, I always felt the need for a collective reflection as I know that the foundation for a solid future which this administration is laying can only be sustainable if there is a collective commitment by Nigerians.\n25. Nigeria is not a country for Mr. President, any ruling or opposition party but a country for all of us and we must play our part, irrespective of challenges we face, to make this country what we desire.\n26. To achieve this, we must focus our minds, TOGETHER as a people, on ways of resolving the identified critical challenges that underlie our present state. These include:\na. Evolving and sustaining a democratic culture that leaves power in the hands of the people;\nb. Supporting the enthronement of the rule of law, demanding accountability of elected representatives and contributing to good governance;\nc. Increasing our commitment to peaceful co-existence in a peaceful, secure and united Nigeria;\nd. Harnessing and Optimizing our tremendous human and natural resources to attain our goal of being in the top twenty economies of the world and in the process;\ne. Lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years;\nf. Strengthening institutions to make them stronger in protecting National Interests; and\ng. Imbibing tolerance in diversity.\n27. I am a firm believer in transparent, free, fair and credible elections as has been demonstrated during my period as a democratically elected President.\n28. The recent build-up and eventual outcome of the Edo State elections should encourage Nigerians that it is my commitment to bequeath to this country processes and procedures that would guarantee that the people’s votes count.\n29. The problems with our electoral process are mainly human induced as desperate desire for power leads to desperate attempts to gain power and office.\n30. Democracy, the world over and as I am pursuing in Nigeria, recognizes the power of the people. However, if some constituencies choose to bargain off their power, they should be prepared for denial of their rights.\n31. This call is made more urgent if we realise that even after a transparent, free, fair and credible election, desperation leads to compromising the judiciary to upturn legitimate decisions of the people.\n32. It is necessary to, therefore support the enthronement of the rule of law by avoiding actions which compromise the judiciary.\n33. Fellow Nigerians, our history has shown that we are a people that have the capacity to live peacefully with one another.\n34. As a government, we remain committed to our constitutional oath of securing the lives and properties of the citizenry. I, however, call on the citizenry to also support government by providing the necessary community level intelligence in addressing these challenges.\n35. In moving forward together, it is important to strengthen our economy to provide sustainable means of livelihood for as many Nigerians as possible so as to eradicate absolute poverty from our midst.\n36. I want to re-emphasize my dedication and commitment, a dedication and commitment that propelled my public service career and informed my quest to continually seek for an opportunity to improve the lives of Nigerians, set the country on the path of prosperity and lead the country to a better future.\n37. This administration has been focused on rebuilding and laying the foundations for a sustainable Nigeria. Of course, we have met and are still meeting the challenges inherent in any rebuilding initiative – more so that of a nation like Nigeria that has undergone avoidable levels of deprivation – but can be surmounted if we all work together.\n38. I wish to re-iterate that our people and our spirit of excellence remains our most important asset.\n39. In this wise, the need to return to our age-old ethical and high moral values would be necessary and this informed my launching of the National Ethics and Integrity Policy on Monday 28th September, 2020.\n40. The policy would not implement itself and the first contact of the visibility of its implementation is the Public Service whose on-going reforms would be expected to be sustainable and give a radical re-direction in providing services to all Nigerians.\n41. Fellow Nigerians, in addition to public health challenges of working to contain the spread of the Coronavirus, we have suffered a significant drop in our foreign exchange earnings and internal revenues due to 40 per cent drop in oil prices and steep drop in economic activities, leading to a 60 per cent drop in government revenue.\n42. Our government is grappling with the dual challenge of saving lives and livelihoods in face of drastically reduced resources.\n43. In this regard, sustaining the level of petroleum prices is no longer possible. The government, since coming into office has recognized the economic argument for adjusting the price of petroleum. But the social argument about the knock-on effect of any adjustment weighed heavily with the government.\n44. Accordingly, in the last three years, we have introduced unprecedented measures in support of the economy and to the weakest members of our society in the shape of:\na. Tradermoni\nb. Farmermoni\nc. School Feeding Programme\nd. Job creation efforts\ne. Agricultural intervention programmes\n45. No government in the past did what we are doing with such scarce resources. We have managed to keep things going in spite of the disproportionate spending on security. Those in the previous Governments from 1999 – 2015 who presided over the near destruction of the country have now the impudence to attempt to criticize our efforts.\n46. In the circumstances, a responsible government must face realities and take tough decisions.\n47. Petroleum prices in Nigeria are to be adjusted. We sell now at N161 per litre. A comparison with our neighbours will illustrate the point;\na. Chad which is an oil producing country charges N362 per litre\nb. Niger, also an oil producing country sells 1 litre at N346.\nc. In Ghana, another oil producing country, petroleum pump price is N326 per litre.\n48. Further afield, Egypt charges N211 per litre. Saudi Arabia charges N168 per litre. It makes no sense for oil to be cheaper in Nigeria than in Saudi Arabia.\n49. Fellow Nigerians, to achieve the great country we desire, we need to solidify our strength, increase our commitment and encourage ourselves to do that which is right and proper even when no one is watching.\n50. Fellow Nigerians, let us collectively resolve to continue our journey beyond the sixty years on the clear understanding that as a nation we are greater together than being smaller units of nationalities. By the special grace of God we shall come through any transient challenges.\n51. It is my sincere hope that by the end of this anniversary on September 30th 2021, we will all be proud of taking this individual and collective self-assessment for the progress of our great Nation.\nLong Live the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\nGod Bless us all.

Sign the petition here.\nSeptember 26, 2020 (LifeSiteNews) – While Democrats and the mainstream media routinely attribute the United States’ relatively high number COVID-19 deaths to Americans’ failure to uniformly wear masks or “socially distance,” a new report suggests the true culprit may be the country’s unwillingness to embrace the drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).\nThe United States is estimated to have seen 7.1 million COVID-19 cases as of September 25, with more than 200,000 deaths and 4.4 million recoveries. Officially it has the most cases in the world (though that ranking is likely due in part to the authoritarian government of China’s refusal to share accurate numbers).\nHCQ has long been approved for use in treating malaria, arthritis, and certain autoimmune conditions, but its potential applications to the coronavirus became a political lightning rod after President Donald Trump first called attention to early studies indicating its potential. The FDA initially issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) allowing it to be distributed from the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) but revoked that authorization in June, claiming “new information” indicated the potential dangers outweighed any potential effectiveness.\nHowever, a white paper published this month by the Economic Standard argues that the primary roadblocks to HCQ are political rather than scientific.\n“The U.S. is an international outlier on HCQ,” the paper says. “Right now, doctors around the world are prescribing HCQ to treat COVID-19 outside of hospitals, as well as prophylactically to prevent infection among healthcare workers and vulnerable populations. This paper argues that HCQ has met the appropriate burden of proof and urges members of the U.S. news media, public health community, and regulatory agencies to stop politicizing the use of this medicine. Tens of thousands of lives still hang in the balance.”\nThe paper lists more than two dozen medical conditions for which HCQ is an established treatment, which it says “reflect a general medical consensus, long predating the COVID-19 pandemic, that HCQ is a safe, well-tolerated drug.”\n“In the U.S. alone from 2007-2017, patients received around 59 million prescriptions for HCQ,” the paper explains. “In over seven decades of use, there have been a handful of reports of fatal arrhythmias due to torsades de pointes from all drug causes, and zero reports of fatal arrhythmias with HCQ use. Most cases of arrhythmia involved extraordinary circumstances, including overdoses and patients with end-stage liver failure. Other side effects, such as retinopathy and kidney damage, result only from years of long-term use and have been described as ‘rare.’”\nHCQ was identified as a potential COVID-19 treatment relatively early in the outbreak, and has been used in China, South Korea, France, Spain, Italy, Turkey, Malaysia, Bahrain, Poland, Russia, Iran, Egypt, Pakistan, India, and the Philippines, “among many others,” the report says. Yet the United States remains an “international outlier on HCQ, as one of just a handful of countries that have moved to limit – rather than expand – patient access to the drug.”\nThis, it continues, was due in part to the American news media focusing on “low-quality or botched RTCs [randomized controlled trials] – misrepresenting these as the ‘gold standard’ – while dismissing observational studies as irrelevant due to supposed biases...This narrative was sustained and amplified by scientists, academics, and government agency staff,” with possibly the most egregious example being a notorious study published in The Lancet that the esteemed medical journal was forced to retract after the data sources turned out to be fraudulent.\n“A Google News search for the words ‘unproven’ and ‘hydroxychloroquine’ in reports published in April and May returned over 160 results, with most of these articles managing to work the adjective into headlines or opening sentences,” the paper goes on. “None of these reports mentioned that observational trials had discovered useful drugs in the past. Nor did they clarify that many observational studies in aggregate can yield more meaningful results than any one single study, RCTs included.”\nLast month, three Republican senators sent a letter to U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Alex Azar this month demanding an explanation as to why the agency revoked its approval of HCQ against the wishes of American doctors and the experiences of other countries.\nLifeSiteNews’ petition calling on the FDA to drop its hostility to hydroxychloroquine has so far collected more than 49,000 signatures.

As President, I wish to renew my appreciation to Nigerians for entrusting me with your hopes and aspirations for a better and greater Nigeria.\n2. Today, it is my unique privilege to re-commit myself to the service of this great country of great people with profound diversities and opportunities. We are bound by destiny to be the largest and greatest black nation on earth.\n3. At this stage in our nationhood it is important that we reflect how we got here to enable us work TOGETHER to get to where we aspire to be as a strong indivisible nation, united in hope and equal in opportunity.\n4. On October 1st 1960 when Prime Minister Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa received the constitutional instruments symbolizing Nigeria’s independence, he expressed his wish that having acquired our rightful status as an independent sovereign nation, history would record that the building of our nation proceeded at the wisest pace.\n5. This optimism was anchored on the peaceful planning, full and open consultation and harmonious cooperation with the different groups which culminated in Nigeria emerging as a country without bitterness and bloodshed.\n6. Our founding fathers understood the imperative of structuring a National identity using the power of the state and worked towards unification of Nigerians in a politically stable and viable entity.\n7. That philosophy guided the foundation that was laid for our young nation of 45 million people with an urban population of approximately 7million occupying an area of 910,768 square kilometers. These demographics led to development challenges for which major efforts were made to overcome.\n8. Today, we grapple with multiple challenges with a population exceeding 200million occupying the same land mass but 52% residing in urban areas.\n9. Sixty years of nationhood provides an opportunity to ask ourselves questions on the extent to which we have sustained the aspirations of our founding fathers. Where did we do the right things? Are we on course? If not where did we stray and how can we remedy and retrace our steps?\n10. Upon attaining independence, Nigeria’s growth trajectory was anchored on policies and programmes that positively impacted on all sectors of the economy. However, this journey was cut short by the 30-months of civil war.\n11. We came out of the civil war with a focus on reconstruction, rehabilitation and reconciliation that enabled the country to put in place world-class development structures and a strengthened public service that well served the government. This positive trajectory continued with a return to democratic government which was truncated by another round of military rule.\n12. For a cumulative 29 of our 60 years existence as a nation, we have been under military rule.\n13. My summary of our journey so far as a nation is necessary to appropriately chart where we need to go and how to get there TOGETHER.\n14. Today, I am aware that our economy along with every single economy in the world is in crisis. We still face security challenges in parts of the country, while our society suffers from a high loss of moral rectitude which is driven by unbridled craving for political control.\n15. An underlying cause of most of the problems we have faced as a nation is our consistent harping on artificially contrived fault-lines that we have harboured and allowed unnecessarily to fester.\n16. In addition, institutions such as civil service, police, the judiciary, the military all suffered from a general decline.\n17. We need to begin a sincere process of national healing and this anniversary presents a genuine opportunity to eliminate old and outworn perceptions that are always put to test in the lie they always are.\n18. The stereotype of thinking of ourselves as coming from one part of the country before seeing ourselves as Nigerians is a key starting point to project us on the road to our deserved nation’s evolution and integration.\n19. To start this healing process, we are already blessed with the most important asset any nation requires for such – OUR PEOPLE – and this has manifested globally in the exploits of Nigerians in many fields.\n20. It has been demonstrated time and time again that Nigerians in the diaspora frequently excel in science, technology, medicine, sports, arts and many other fields.\n21. Similarly, the creativity, ingenuity and resourcefulness of the Nigerian at home have resulted in globally recognized endeavours.\n22. I am convinced that if we pursue our aspirations TOGETHER we would be able to achieve whatever we desire. That informed our adopting the theme TOGETHER to mark this epochal event.\n23. Together we can change our condition for the better and more importantly, together we can do much more for ourselves and for our country.\n24. I chose the path of self-reflection because this is what I do on a daily basis and I must confess that at most times, I always felt the need for a collective reflection as I know that the foundation for a solid future which this administration is laying can only be sustainable if there is a collective commitment by Nigerians.\n25. Nigeria is not a country for Mr. President, any ruling or opposition party but a country for all of us and we must play our part, irrespective of challenges we face, to make this country what we desire.\n26. To achieve this, we must focus our minds, TOGETHER as a people, on ways of resolving the identified critical challenges that underlie our present state. These include:\na. Evolving and sustaining a democratic culture that leaves power in the hands of the people;\nb. Supporting the enthronement of the rule of law, demanding accountability of elected representatives and contributing to good governance;\nc. Increasing our commitment to peaceful co-existence in a peaceful, secure and united Nigeria;\nd. Harnessing and Optimizing our tremendous human and natural resources to attain our goal of being in the top twenty economies of the world and in the process;\ne. Lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years;\nf. Strengthening institutions to make them stronger in protecting National Interests; and\ng. Imbibing tolerance in diversity.\n27. I am a firm believer in transparent, free, fair and credible elections as has been demonstrated during my period as a democratically elected President.\n28. The recent build-up and eventual outcome of the Edo State elections should encourage Nigerians that it is my commitment to bequeath to this country processes and procedures that would guarantee that the people’s votes count.\n29. The problems with our electoral process are mainly human induced as desperate desire for power leads to desperate attempts to gain power and office.\n30. Democracy, the world over and as I am pursuing in Nigeria, recognizes the power of the people. However, if some constituencies choose to bargain off their power, they should be prepared for denial of their rights.\n31. This call is made more urgent if we realise that even after a transparent, free, fair and credible election, desperation leads to compromising the judiciary to upturn legitimate decisions of the people.\n32. It is necessary to, therefore support the enthronement of the rule of law by avoiding actions which compromise the judiciary.\n33. Fellow Nigerians, our history has shown that we are a people that have the capacity to live peacefully with one another.\n34. As a government, we remain committed to our constitutional oath of securing the lives and properties of the citizenry. I, however, call on the citizenry to also support government by providing the necessary community level intelligence in addressing these challenges.\n35. In moving forward together, it is important to strengthen our economy to provide sustainable means of livelihood for as many Nigerians as possible so as to eradicate absolute poverty from our midst.\n36. I want to re-emphasize my dedication and commitment, a dedication and commitment that propelled my public service career and informed my quest to continually seek for an opportunity to improve the lives of Nigerians, set the country on the path of prosperity and lead the country to a better future.\n37. This administration has been focused on rebuilding and laying the foundations for a sustainable Nigeria. Of course, we have met and are still meeting the challenges inherent in any rebuilding initiative – more so that of a nation like Nigeria that has undergone avoidable levels of deprivation – but can be surmounted if we all work together.\n38. I wish to re-iterate that our people and our spirit of excellence remains our most important asset.\n39. In this wise, the need to return to our age-old ethical and high moral values would be necessary and this informed my launching of the National Ethics and Integrity Policy on Monday 28th September, 2020.\n40. The policy would not implement itself and the first contact of the visibility of its implementation is the Public Service whose on-going reforms would be expected to be sustainable and give a radical re-direction in providing services to all Nigerians.\n41. Fellow Nigerians, in addition to public health challenges of working to contain the spread of the Coronavirus, we have suffered a significant drop in our foreign exchange earnings and internal revenues due to 40 per cent drop in oil prices and steep drop in economic activities, leading to a 60 per cent drop in government revenue.\n42. Our government is grappling with the dual challenge of saving lives and livelihoods in face of drastically reduced resources.\n43. In this regard, sustaining the level of petroleum prices is no longer possible. The government, since coming into office has recognized the economic argument for adjusting the price of petroleum. But the social argument about the knock-on effect of any adjustment weighed heavily with the government.\n44. Accordingly, in the last three years, we have introduced unprecedented measures in support of the economy and to the weakest members of our society in the shape of:\na. Tradermoni\nb. Farmermoni\nc. School Feeding Programme\nd. Job creation efforts\ne. Agricultural intervention programmes\n45. No government in the past did what we are doing with such scarce resources. We have managed to keep things going in spite of the disproportionate spending on security. Those in the previous Governments from 1999 – 2015 who presided over the near destruction of the country have now the impudence to attempt to criticize our efforts.\n46. In the circumstances, a responsible government must face realities and take tough decisions.\n47. Petroleum prices in Nigeria are to be adjusted. We sell now at N161 per litre. A comparison with our neighbours will illustrate the point;\na. Chad which is an oil producing country charges N362 per litre\nb. Niger, also an oil producing country sells 1 litre at N346.\nc. In Ghana, another oil producing country, petroleum pump price is N326 per litre.\n48. Further afield, Egypt charges N211 per litre. Saudi Arabia charges N168 per litre. It makes no sense for oil to be cheaper in Nigeria than in Saudi Arabia.\n49. Fellow Nigerians, to achieve the great country we desire, we need to solidify our strength, increase our commitment and encourage ourselves to do that which is right and proper even when no one is watching.\n50. Fellow Nigerians, let us collectively resolve to continue our journey beyond the sixty years on the clear understanding that as a nation we are greater together than being smaller units of nationalities. By the special grace of God we shall come through any transient challenges.\n51. It is my sincere hope that by the end of this anniversary on September 30th 2021, we will all be proud of taking this individual and collective self-assessment for the progress of our great Nation.\nLong Live the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\nGod Bless us all.

The policy would not implement itself and the first contact of the visibility of its implementation is the Public Service whose on-going reforms would be expected to be sustainable and give a radical re-direction in providing services to all Nigerians.\n41. Fellow Nigerians, in addition to public health challenges of working to contain the spread of the Coronavirus, we have suffered a significant drop in our foreign exchange earnings and internal revenues due to 40 per cent drop in oil prices and steep drop in economic activities, leading to a 60 per cent drop in government revenue.\n42. Our government is grappling with the dual challenge of saving lives and livelihoods in face of drastically reduced resources.\n43. In this regard, sustaining the level of petroleum prices is no longer possible. The government, since coming into office has recognized the economic argument for adjusting the price of petroleum. But the social argument about the knock-on effect of any adjustment weighed heavily with the government.\n44. Accordingly, in the last three years, we have introduced unprecedented measures in support of the economy and to the weakest members of our society in the shape of:\na. Tradermoni\nb. Farmermoni\nc. School Feeding Programme\nd. Job creation efforts\ne. Agricultural intervention programmes\n45. No government in the past did what we are doing with such scarce resources. We have managed to keep things going in spite of the disproportionate spending on security. Those in the previous Governments from 1999 – 2015 who presided over the near destruction of the country have now the impudence to attempt to criticize our efforts.\n46. In the circumstances, a responsible government must face realities and take tough decisions.\n47. Petroleum prices in Nigeria are to be adjusted. We sell now at N161 per litre. A comparison with our neighbours will illustrate the point;\na. Chad which is an oil producing country charges N362 per litre\nb. Niger, also an oil producing country sells 1 litre at N346.\nc. In Ghana, another oil producing country, petroleum pump price is N326 per litre.\n48. Further afield, Egypt charges N211 per litre. Saudi Arabia charges N168 per litre. It makes no sense for oil to be cheaper in Nigeria than in Saudi Arabia.\n49. Fellow Nigerians, to achieve the great country we desire, we need to solidify our strength, increase our commitment and encourage ourselves to do that which is right and proper even when no one is watching.\n50. Fellow Nigerians, let us collectively resolve to continue our journey beyond the sixty years on the clear understanding that as a nation we are greater together than being smaller units of nationalities. By the special grace of God we shall come through any transient challenges.\n51. It is my sincere hope that by the end of this anniversary on September 30th 2021, we will all be proud of taking this individual and collective self-assessment for the progress of our great Nation.\nLong Live the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\nGod Bless us all.

As President, I wish to renew my appreciation to Nigerians for entrusting me with your hopes and aspirations for a better and greater Nigeria.\n2. Today, it is my unique privilege to re-commit myself to the service of this great country of great people with profound diversities and opportunities. We are bound by destiny to be the largest and greatest black nation on earth.\n3. At this stage in our nationhood it is important that we reflect how we got here to enable us work TOGETHER to get to where we aspire to be as a strong indivisible nation, united in hope and equal in opportunity.\n4. On October 1st 1960 when Prime Minister Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa received the constitutional instruments symbolizing Nigeria’s independence, he expressed his wish that having acquired our rightful status as an independent sovereign nation, history would record that the building of our nation proceeded at the wisest pace.\n5. This optimism was anchored on the peaceful planning, full and open consultation and harmonious cooperation with the different groups which culminated in Nigeria emerging as a country without bitterness and bloodshed.\n6. Our founding fathers understood the imperative of structuring a National identity using the power of the state and worked towards unification of Nigerians in a politically stable and viable entity.\n7. That philosophy guided the foundation that was laid for our young nation of 45 million people with an urban population of approximately 7million occupying an area of 910,768 square kilometers. These demographics led to development challenges for which major efforts were made to overcome.\n8. Today, we grapple with multiple challenges with a population exceeding 200million occupying the same land mass but 52% residing in urban areas.\n9. Sixty years of nationhood provides an opportunity to ask ourselves questions on the extent to which we have sustained the aspirations of our founding fathers. Where did we do the right things? Are we on course? If not where did we stray and how can we remedy and retrace our steps?\n10. Upon attaining independence, Nigeria’s growth trajectory was anchored on policies and programmes that positively impacted on all sectors of the economy. However, this journey was cut short by the 30-months of civil war.\n11. We came out of the civil war with a focus on reconstruction, rehabilitation and reconciliation that enabled the country to put in place world-class development structures and a strengthened public service that well served the government. This positive trajectory continued with a return to democratic government which was truncated by another round of military rule.\n12. For a cumulative 29 of our 60 years existence as a nation, we have been under military rule.\n13. My summary of our journey so far as a nation is necessary to appropriately chart where we need to go and how to get there TOGETHER.\n14. Today, I am aware that our economy along with every single economy in the world is in crisis. We still face security challenges in parts of the country, while our society suffers from a high loss of moral rectitude which is driven by unbridled craving for political control.\n15. An underlying cause of most of the problems we have faced as a nation is our consistent harping on artificially contrived fault-lines that we have harboured and allowed unnecessarily to fester.\n16. In addition, institutions such as civil service, police, the judiciary, the military all suffered from a general decline.\n17. We need to begin a sincere process of national healing and this anniversary presents a genuine opportunity to eliminate old and outworn perceptions that are always put to test in the lie they always are.\n18. The stereotype of thinking of ourselves as coming from one part of the country before seeing ourselves as Nigerians is a key starting point to project us on the road to our deserved nation’s evolution and integration.\n19. To start this healing process, we are already blessed with the most important asset any nation requires for such – OUR PEOPLE – and this has manifested globally in the exploits of Nigerians in many fields.\n20. It has been demonstrated time and time again that Nigerians in the diaspora frequently excel in science, technology, medicine, sports, arts and many other fields.\n21. Similarly, the creativity, ingenuity and resourcefulness of the Nigerian at home have resulted in globally recognized endeavours.\n22. I am convinced that if we pursue our aspirations TOGETHER we would be able to achieve whatever we desire. That informed our adopting the theme TOGETHER to mark this epochal event.\n23. Together we can change our condition for the better and more importantly, together we can do much more for ourselves and for our country.\n24. I chose the path of self-reflection because this is what I do on a daily basis and I must confess that at most times, I always felt the need for a collective reflection as I know that the foundation for a solid future which this administration is laying can only be sustainable if there is a collective commitment by Nigerians.\n25. Nigeria is not a country for Mr. President, any ruling or opposition party but a country for all of us and we must play our part, irrespective of challenges we face, to make this country what we desire.\n26. To achieve this, we must focus our minds, TOGETHER as a people, on ways of resolving the identified critical challenges that underlie our present state. These include:\na. Evolving and sustaining a democratic culture that leaves power in the hands of the people;\nb. Supporting the enthronement of the rule of law, demanding accountability of elected representatives and contributing to good governance;\nc. Increasing our commitment to peaceful co-existence in a peaceful, secure and united Nigeria;\nd. Harnessing and Optimizing our tremendous human and natural resources to attain our goal of being in the top twenty economies of the world and in the process;\ne. Lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years;\nf. Strengthening institutions to make them stronger in protecting National Interests; and\ng. Imbibing tolerance in diversity.\n27. I am a firm believer in transparent, free, fair and credible elections as has been demonstrated during my period as a democratically elected President.\n28. The recent build-up and eventual outcome of the Edo State elections should encourage Nigerians that it is my commitment to bequeath to this country processes and procedures that would guarantee that the people’s votes count.\n29. The problems with our electoral process are mainly human induced as desperate desire for power leads to desperate attempts to gain power and office.\n30. Democracy, the world over and as I am pursuing in Nigeria, recognizes the power of the people. However, if some constituencies choose to bargain off their power, they should be prepared for denial of their rights.\n31. This call is made more urgent if we realise that even after a transparent, free, fair and credible election, desperation leads to compromising the judiciary to upturn legitimate decisions of the people.\n32. It is necessary to, therefore support the enthronement of the rule of law by avoiding actions which compromise the judiciary.\n33. Fellow Nigerians, our history has shown that we are a people that have the capacity to live peacefully with one another.\n34. As a government, we remain committed to our constitutional oath of securing the lives and properties of the citizenry. I, however, call on the citizenry to also support government by providing the necessary community level intelligence in addressing these challenges.\n35. In moving forward together, it is important to strengthen our economy to provide sustainable means of livelihood for as many Nigerians as possible so as to eradicate absolute poverty from our midst.\n36. I want to re-emphasize my dedication and commitment, a dedication and commitment that propelled my public service career and informed my quest to continually seek for an opportunity to improve the lives of Nigerians, set the country on the path of prosperity and lead the country to a better future.\n37. This administration has been focused on rebuilding and laying the foundations for a sustainable Nigeria. Of course, we have met and are still meeting the challenges inherent in any rebuilding initiative – more so that of a nation like Nigeria that has undergone avoidable levels of deprivation – but can be surmounted if we all work together.\n38. I wish to re-iterate that our people and our spirit of excellence remains our most important asset.\n39. In this wise, the need to return to our age-old ethical and high moral values would be necessary and this informed my launching of the National Ethics and Integrity Policy on Monday 28th September, 2020.\n40. The policy would not implement itself and the first contact of the visibility of its implementation is the Public Service whose on-going reforms would be expected to be sustainable and give a radical re-direction in providing services to all Nigerians.\n41. Fellow Nigerians, in addition to public health challenges of working to contain the spread of the Coronavirus, we have suffered a significant drop in our foreign exchange earnings and internal revenues due to 40 per cent drop in oil prices and steep drop in economic activities, leading to a 60 per cent drop in government revenue.\n42. Our government is grappling with the dual challenge of saving lives and livelihoods in face of drastically reduced resources.\n43. In this regard, sustaining the level of petroleum prices is no longer possible. The government, since coming into office has recognized the economic argument for adjusting the price of petroleum.

We have managed to keep things going in spite of the disproportionate spending on security. Those in the previous Governments from 1999 – 2015 who presided over the near destruction of the country have now the impudence to attempt to criticize our efforts.\n46. In the circumstances, a responsible government must face realities and take tough decisions.\n47. Petroleum prices in Nigeria are to be adjusted. We sell now at N161 per litre. A comparison with our neighbours will illustrate the point;\na. Chad which is an oil producing country charges N362 per litre\nb. Niger, also an oil producing country sells 1 litre at N346.\nc.

It makes no sense for oil to be cheaper in Nigeria than in Saudi Arabia.\n49. Fellow Nigerians, to achieve the great country we desire, we need to solidify our strength, increase our commitment and encourage ourselves to do that which is right and proper even when no one is watching.\n50. Fellow Nigerians, let us collectively resolve to continue our journey beyond the sixty years on the clear understanding that as a nation we are greater together than being smaller units of nationalities. By the special grace of God we shall come through any transient challenges.\n51. It is my sincere hope that by the end of this anniversary on September 30th 2021, we will all be proud of taking this individual and collective self-assessment for the progress of our great Nation.\nLong Live the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\nGod Bless us all.

That philosophy guided the foundation that was laid for our young nation of 45 million people with an urban population of approximately 7million occupying an area of 910,768 square kilometers. These demographics led to development challenges for which major efforts were made to overcome.\n8. Today, we grapple with multiple challenges with a population exceeding 200million occupying the same land mass but 52% residing in urban areas.\n9. Sixty years of nationhood provides an opportunity to ask ourselves questions on the extent to which we have sustained the aspirations of our founding fathers. Where did we do the right things? Are we on course? If not where did we stray and how can we remedy and retrace our steps?\n10. Upon attaining independence, Nigeria’s growth trajectory was anchored on policies and programmes that positively impacted on all sectors of the economy. However, this journey was cut short by the 30-months of civil war.\n11. We came out of the civil war with a focus on reconstruction, rehabilitation and reconciliation that enabled the country to put in place world-class development structures and a strengthened public service that well served the government. This positive trajectory continued with a return to democratic government which was truncated by another round of military rule.\n12. For a cumulative 29 of our 60 years existence as a nation, we have been under military rule.\n13. My summary of our journey so far as a nation is necessary to appropriately chart where we need to go and how to get there TOGETHER.\n14. Today, I am aware that our economy along with every single economy in the world is in crisis. We still face security challenges in parts of the country, while our society suffers from a high loss of moral rectitude which is driven by unbridled craving for political control.\n15. An underlying cause of most of the problems we have faced as a nation is our consistent harping on artificially contrived fault-lines that we have harboured and allowed unnecessarily to fester.\n16. In addition, institutions such as civil service, police, the judiciary, the military all suffered from a general decline.\n17. We need to begin a sincere process of national healing and this anniversary presents a genuine opportunity to eliminate old and outworn perceptions that are always put to test in the lie they always are.\n18. The stereotype of thinking of ourselves as coming from one part of the country before seeing ourselves as Nigerians is a key starting point to project us on the road to our deserved nation’s evolution and integration.\n19. To start this healing process, we are already blessed with the most important asset any nation requires for such – OUR PEOPLE – and this has manifested globally in the exploits of Nigerians in many fields.\n20. It has been demonstrated time and time again that Nigerians in the diaspora frequently excel in science, technology, medicine, sports, arts and many other fields.\n21. Similarly, the creativity, ingenuity and resourcefulness of the Nigerian at home have resulted in globally recognized endeavours.\n22. I am convinced that if we pursue our aspirations TOGETHER we would be able to achieve whatever we desire. That informed our adopting the theme TOGETHER to mark this epochal event.\n23. Together we can change our condition for the better and more importantly, together we can do much more for ourselves and for our country.\n24. I chose the path of self-reflection because this is what I do on a daily basis and I must confess that at most times, I always felt the need for a collective reflection as I know that the foundation for a solid future which this administration is laying can only be sustainable if there is a collective commitment by Nigerians.\n25. Nigeria is not a country for Mr. President, any ruling or opposition party but a country for all of us and we must play our part, irrespective of challenges we face, to make this country what we desire.\n26. To achieve this, we must focus our minds, TOGETHER as a people, on ways of resolving the identified critical challenges that underlie our present state. These include:\na. Evolving and sustaining a democratic culture that leaves power in the hands of the people;\nb. Supporting the enthronement of the rule of law, demanding accountability of elected representatives and contributing to good governance;\nc. Increasing our commitment to peaceful co-existence in a peaceful, secure and united Nigeria;\nd. Harnessing and Optimizing our tremendous human and natural resources to attain our goal of being in the top twenty economies of the world and in the process;\ne. Lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years;\nf. Strengthening institutions to make them stronger in protecting National Interests; and\ng. Imbibing tolerance in diversity.\n27. I am a firm believer in transparent, free, fair and credible elections as has been demonstrated during my period as a democratically elected President.\n28. The recent build-up and eventual outcome of the Edo State elections should encourage Nigerians that it is my commitment to bequeath to this country processes and procedures that would guarantee that the people’s votes count.\n29. The problems with our electoral process are mainly human induced as desperate desire for power leads to desperate attempts to gain power and office.\n30. Democracy, the world over and as I am pursuing in Nigeria, recognizes the power of the people. However, if some constituencies choose to bargain off their power, they should be prepared for denial of their rights.\n31. This call is made more urgent if we realise that even after a transparent, free, fair and credible election, desperation leads to compromising the judiciary to upturn legitimate decisions of the people.\n32. It is necessary to, therefore support the enthronement of the rule of law by avoiding actions which compromise the judiciary.\n33. Fellow Nigerians, our history has shown that we are a people that have the capacity to live peacefully with one another.\n34. As a government, we remain committed to our constitutional oath of securing the lives and properties of the citizenry. I, however, call on the citizenry to also support government by providing the necessary community level intelligence in addressing these challenges.\n35. In moving forward together, it is important to strengthen our economy to provide sustainable means of livelihood for as many Nigerians as possible so as to eradicate absolute poverty from our midst.\n36. I want to re-emphasize my dedication and commitment, a dedication and commitment that propelled my public service career and informed my quest to continually seek for an opportunity to improve the lives of Nigerians, set the country on the path of prosperity and lead the country to a better future.\n37. This administration has been focused on rebuilding and laying the foundations for a sustainable Nigeria. Of course, we have met and are still meeting the challenges inherent in any rebuilding initiative – more so that of a nation like Nigeria that has undergone avoidable levels of deprivation – but can be surmounted if we all work together.\n38. I wish to re-iterate that our people and our spirit of excellence remains our most important asset.\n39. In this wise, the need to return to our age-old ethical and high moral values would be necessary and this informed my launching of the National Ethics and Integrity Policy on Monday 28th September, 2020.\n40. The policy would not implement itself and the first contact of the visibility of its implementation is the Public Service whose on-going reforms would be expected to be sustainable and give a radical re-direction in providing services to all Nigerians.\n41. Fellow Nigerians, in addition to public health challenges of working to contain the spread of the Coronavirus, we have suffered a significant drop in our foreign exchange earnings and internal revenues due to 40 per cent drop in oil prices and steep drop in economic activities, leading to a 60 per cent drop in government revenue.\n42. Our government is grappling with the dual challenge of saving lives and livelihoods in face of drastically reduced resources.\n43. In this regard, sustaining the level of petroleum prices is no longer possible. The government, since coming into office has recognized the economic argument for adjusting the price of petroleum. But the social argument about the knock-on effect of any adjustment weighed heavily with the government.\n44. Accordingly, in the last three years, we have introduced unprecedented measures in support of the economy and to the weakest members of our society in the shape of:\na. Tradermoni\nb. Farmermoni\nc. School Feeding Programme\nd. Job creation efforts\ne. Agricultural intervention programmes\n45. No government in the past did what we are doing with such scarce resources. We have managed to keep things going in spite of the disproportionate spending on security. Those in the previous Governments from 1999 – 2015 who presided over the near destruction of the country have now the impudence to attempt to criticize our efforts.\n46. In the circumstances, a responsible government must face realities and take tough decisions.\n47. Petroleum prices in Nigeria are to be adjusted. We sell now at N161 per litre. A comparison with our neighbours will illustrate the point;\na. Chad which is an oil producing country charges N362 per litre\nb. Niger, also an oil producing country sells 1 litre at N346.\nc. In Ghana, another oil producing country, petroleum pump price is N326 per litre.\n48. Further afield, Egypt charges N211 per litre. Saudi Arabia charges N168 per litre. It makes no sense for oil to be cheaper in Nigeria than in Saudi Arabia.\n49. Fellow Nigerians, to achieve the great country we desire, we need to solidify our strength, increase our commitment and encourage ourselves to do that which is right and proper even when no one is watching.\n50. Fellow Nigerians, let us collectively resolve to continue our journey beyond the sixty years on the clear understanding that as a nation we are greater together than being smaller units of nationalities. By the special grace of God we shall come through any transient challenges.\n51. It is my sincere hope that by the end of this anniversary on September 30th 2021, we will all be proud of taking this individual and collective self-assessment for the progress of our great Nation.\nLong Live the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\nGod Bless us all.

As President, I wish to renew my appreciation to Nigerians for entrusting me with your hopes and aspirations for a better and greater Nigeria.\n2. Today, it is my unique privilege to re-commit myself to the service of this great country of great people with profound diversities and opportunities. We are bound by destiny to be the largest and greatest black nation on earth.\n3. At this stage in our nationhood it is important that we reflect how we got here to enable us work TOGETHER to get to where we aspire to be as a strong indivisible nation, united in hope and equal in opportunity.\n4. On October 1st 1960 when Prime Minister Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa received the constitutional instruments symbolizing Nigeria’s independence, he expressed his wish that having acquired our rightful status as an independent sovereign nation, history would record that the building of our nation proceeded at the wisest pace.\n5.

Evolving and sustaining a democratic culture that leaves power in the hands of the people;\nb. Supporting the enthronement of the rule of law, demanding accountability of elected representatives and contributing to good governance;\nc. Increasing our commitment to peaceful co-existence in a peaceful, secure and united Nigeria;\nd. Harnessing and Optimizing our tremendous human and natural resources to attain our goal of being in the top twenty economies of the world and in the process;\ne. Lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years;\nf. Strengthening institutions to make them stronger in protecting National Interests; and\ng. Imbibing tolerance in diversity.\n27. I am a firm believer in transparent, free, fair and credible elections as has been demonstrated during my period as a democratically elected President.\n28. The recent build-up and eventual outcome of the Edo State elections should encourage Nigerians that it is my commitment to bequeath to this country processes and procedures that would guarantee that the people’s votes count.\n29. The problems with our electoral process are mainly human induced as desperate desire for power leads to desperate attempts to gain power and office.\n30. Democracy, the world over and as I am pursuing in Nigeria, recognizes the power of the people. However, if some constituencies choose to bargain off their power, they should be prepared for denial of their rights.\n31. This call is made more urgent if we realise that even after a transparent, free, fair and credible election, desperation leads to compromising the judiciary to upturn legitimate decisions of the people.\n32. It is necessary to, therefore support the enthronement of the rule of law by avoiding actions which compromise the judiciary.\n33. Fellow Nigerians, our history has shown that we are a people that have the capacity to live peacefully with one another.\n34. As a government, we remain committed to our constitutional oath of securing the lives and properties of the citizenry. I, however, call on the citizenry to also support government by providing the necessary community level intelligence in addressing these challenges.\n35. In moving forward together, it is important to strengthen our economy to provide sustainable means of livelihood for as many Nigerians as possible so as to eradicate absolute poverty from our midst.\n36. I want to re-emphasize my dedication and commitment, a dedication and commitment that propelled my public service career and informed my quest to continually seek for an opportunity to improve the lives of Nigerians, set the country on the path of prosperity and lead the country to a better future.\n37. This administration has been focused on rebuilding and laying the foundations for a sustainable Nigeria. Of course, we have met and are still meeting the challenges inherent in any rebuilding initiative – more so that of a nation like Nigeria that has undergone avoidable levels of deprivation – but can be surmounted if we all work together.\n38. I wish to re-iterate that our people and our spirit of excellence remains our most important asset.\n39. In this wise, the need to return to our age-old ethical and high moral values would be necessary and this informed my launching of the National Ethics and Integrity Policy on Monday 28th September, 2020.\n40. The policy would not implement itself and the first contact of the visibility of its implementation is the Public Service whose on-going reforms would be expected to be sustainable and give a radical re-direction in providing services to all Nigerians.\n41. Fellow Nigerians, in addition to public health challenges of working to contain the spread of the Coronavirus, we have suffered a significant drop in our foreign exchange earnings and internal revenues due to 40 per cent drop in oil prices and steep drop in economic activities, leading to a 60 per cent drop in government revenue.\n42. Our government is grappling with the dual challenge of saving lives and livelihoods in face of drastically reduced resources.\n43. In this regard, sustaining the level of petroleum prices is no longer possible. The government, since coming into office has recognized the economic argument for adjusting the price of petroleum. But the social argument about the knock-on effect of any adjustment weighed heavily with the government.\n44. Accordingly, in the last three years, we have introduced unprecedented measures in support of the economy and to the weakest members of our society in the shape of:\na. Tradermoni\nb. Farmermoni\nc. School Feeding Programme\nd. Job creation efforts\ne. Agricultural intervention programmes\n45. No government in the past did what we are doing with such scarce resources. We have managed to keep things going in spite of the disproportionate spending on security. Those in the previous Governments from 1999 – 2015 who presided over the near destruction of the country have now the impudence to attempt to criticize our efforts.\n46. In the circumstances, a responsible government must face realities and take tough decisions.\n47. Petroleum prices in Nigeria are to be adjusted. We sell now at N161 per litre. A comparison with our neighbours will illustrate the point;\na. Chad which is an oil producing country charges N362 per litre\nb. Niger, also an oil producing country sells 1 litre at N346.\nc. In Ghana, another oil producing country, petroleum pump price is N326 per litre.\n48. Further afield, Egypt charges N211 per litre. Saudi Arabia charges N168 per litre. It makes no sense for oil to be cheaper in Nigeria than in Saudi Arabia.\n49. Fellow Nigerians, to achieve the great country we desire, we need to solidify our strength, increase our commitment and encourage ourselves to do that which is right and proper even when no one is watching.\n50. Fellow Nigerians, let us collectively resolve to continue our journey beyond the sixty years on the clear understanding that as a nation we are greater together than being smaller units of nationalities. By the special grace of God we shall come through any transient challenges.\n51. It is my sincere hope that by the end of this anniversary on September 30th 2021, we will all be proud of taking this individual and collective self-assessment for the progress of our great Nation.\nLong Live the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\nGod Bless us all.

As President, I wish to renew my appreciation to Nigerians for entrusting me with your hopes and aspirations for a better and greater Nigeria.\n2. Today, it is my unique privilege to re-commit myself to the service of this great country of great people with profound diversities and opportunities. We are bound by destiny to be the largest and greatest black nation on earth.\n3. At this stage in our nationhood it is important that we reflect how we got here to enable us work TOGETHER to get to where we aspire to be as a strong indivisible nation, united in hope and equal in opportunity.\n4. On October 1st 1960 when Prime Minister Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa received the constitutional instruments symbolizing Nigeria’s independence, he expressed his wish that having acquired our rightful status as an independent sovereign nation, history would record that the building of our nation proceeded at the wisest pace.\n5. This optimism was anchored on the peaceful planning, full and open consultation and harmonious cooperation with the different groups which culminated in Nigeria emerging as a country without bitterness and bloodshed.\n6. Our founding fathers understood the imperative of structuring a National identity using the power of the state and worked towards unification of Nigerians in a politically stable and viable entity.\n7. That philosophy guided the foundation that was laid for our young nation of 45 million people with an urban population of approximately 7million occupying an area of 910,768 square kilometers. These demographics led to development challenges for which major efforts were made to overcome.\n8. Today, we grapple with multiple challenges with a population exceeding 200million occupying the same land mass but 52% residing in urban areas.\n9. Sixty years of nationhood provides an opportunity to ask ourselves questions on the extent to which we have sustained the aspirations of our founding fathers. Where did we do the right things? Are we on course? If not where did we stray and how can we remedy and retrace our steps?\n10. Upon attaining independence, Nigeria’s growth trajectory was anchored on policies and programmes that positively impacted on all sectors of the economy. However, this journey was cut short by the 30-months of civil war.\n11. We came out of the civil war with a focus on reconstruction, rehabilitation and reconciliation that enabled the country to put in place world-class development structures and a strengthened public service that well served the government. This positive trajectory continued with a return to democratic government which was truncated by another round of military rule.\n12. For a cumulative 29 of our 60 years existence as a nation, we have been under military rule.\n13. My summary of our journey so far as a nation is necessary to appropriately chart where we need to go and how to get there TOGETHER.\n14. Today, I am aware that our economy along with every single economy in the world is in crisis. We still face security challenges in parts of the country, while our society suffers from a high loss of moral rectitude which is driven by unbridled craving for political control.\n15. An underlying cause of most of the problems we have faced as a nation is our consistent harping on artificially contrived fault-lines that we have harboured and allowed unnecessarily to fester.\n16. In addition, institutions such as civil service, police, the judiciary, the military all suffered from a general decline.\n17. We need to begin a sincere process of national healing and this anniversary presents a genuine opportunity to eliminate old and outworn perceptions that are always put to test in the lie they always are.\n18. The stereotype of thinking of ourselves as coming from one part of the country before seeing ourselves as Nigerians is a key starting point to project us on the road to our deserved nation’s evolution and integration.\n19. To start this healing process, we are already blessed with the most important asset any nation requires for such – OUR PEOPLE – and this has manifested globally in the exploits of Nigerians in many fields.\n20. It has been demonstrated time and time again that Nigerians in the diaspora frequently excel in science, technology, medicine, sports, arts and many other fields.\n21. Similarly, the creativity, ingenuity and resourcefulness of the Nigerian at home have resulted in globally recognized endeavours.\n22. I am convinced that if we pursue our aspirations TOGETHER we would be able to achieve whatever we desire. That informed our adopting the theme TOGETHER to mark this epochal event.\n23. Together we can change our condition for the better and more importantly, together we can do much more for ourselves and for our country.\n24. I chose the path of self-reflection because this is what I do on a daily basis and I must confess that at most times, I always felt the need for a collective reflection as I know that the foundation for a solid future which this administration is laying can only be sustainable if there is a collective commitment by Nigerians.\n25. Nigeria is not a country for Mr. President, any ruling or opposition party but a country for all of us and we must play our part, irrespective of challenges we face, to make this country what we desire.\n26. To achieve this, we must focus our minds, TOGETHER as a people, on ways of resolving the identified critical challenges that underlie our present state. These include:\na. Evolving and sustaining a democratic culture that leaves power in the hands of the people;\nb. Supporting the enthronement of the rule of law, demanding accountability of elected representatives and contributing to good governance;\nc. Increasing our commitment to peaceful co-existence in a peaceful, secure and united Nigeria;\nd. Harnessing and Optimizing our tremendous human and natural resources to attain our goal of being in the top twenty economies of the world and in the process;\ne. Lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years;\nf. Strengthening institutions to make them stronger in protecting National Interests; and\ng. Imbibing tolerance in diversity.\n27.

The problems with our electoral process are mainly human induced as desperate desire for power leads to desperate attempts to gain power and office.\n30.

As President, I wish to renew my appreciation to Nigerians for entrusting me with your hopes and aspirations for a better and greater Nigeria.\n2. Today, it is my unique privilege to re-commit myself to the service of this great country of great people with profound diversities and opportunities. We are bound by destiny to be the largest and greatest black nation on earth.\n3. At this stage in our nationhood it is important that we reflect how we got here to enable us work TOGETHER to get to where we aspire to be as a strong indivisible nation, united in hope and equal in opportunity.\n4. On October 1st 1960 when Prime Minister Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa received the constitutional instruments symbolizing Nigeria’s independence, he expressed his wish that having acquired our rightful status as an independent sovereign nation, history would record that the building of our nation proceeded at the wisest pace.\n5. This optimism was anchored on the peaceful planning, full and open consultation and harmonious cooperation with the different groups which culminated in Nigeria emerging as a country without bitterness and bloodshed.\n6. Our founding fathers understood the imperative of structuring a National identity using the power of the state and worked towards unification of Nigerians in a politically stable and viable entity.\n7. That philosophy guided the foundation that was laid for our young nation of 45 million people with an urban population of approximately 7million occupying an area of 910,768 square kilometers. These demographics led to development challenges for which major efforts were made to overcome.\n8. Today, we grapple with multiple challenges with a population exceeding 200million occupying the same land mass but 52% residing in urban areas.\n9. Sixty years of nationhood provides an opportunity to ask ourselves questions on the extent to which we have sustained the aspirations of our founding fathers. Where did we do the right things? Are we on course? If not where did we stray and how can we remedy and retrace our steps?\n10. Upon attaining independence, Nigeria’s growth trajectory was anchored on policies and programmes that positively impacted on all sectors of the economy. However, this journey was cut short by the 30-months of civil war.\n11. We came out of the civil war with a focus on reconstruction, rehabilitation and reconciliation that enabled the country to put in place world-class development structures and a strengthened public service that well served the government. This positive trajectory continued with a return to democratic government which was truncated by another round of military rule.\n12. For a cumulative 29 of our 60 years existence as a nation, we have been under military rule.\n13. My summary of our journey so far as a nation is necessary to appropriately chart where we need to go and how to get there TOGETHER.\n14. Today, I am aware that our economy along with every single economy in the world is in crisis. We still face security challenges in parts of the country, while our society suffers from a high loss of moral rectitude which is driven by unbridled craving for political control.\n15. An underlying cause of most of the problems we have faced as a nation is our consistent harping on artificially contrived fault-lines that we have harboured and allowed unnecessarily to fester.\n16. In addition, institutions such as civil service, police, the judiciary, the military all suffered from a general decline.\n17. We need to begin a sincere process of national healing and this anniversary presents a genuine opportunity to eliminate old and outworn perceptions that are always put to test in the lie they always are.\n18. The stereotype of thinking of ourselves as coming from one part of the country before seeing ourselves as Nigerians is a key starting point to project us on the road to our deserved nation’s evolution and integration.\n19. To start this healing process, we are already blessed with the most important asset any nation requires for such – OUR PEOPLE – and this has manifested globally in the exploits of Nigerians in many fields.\n20. It has been demonstrated time and time again that Nigerians in the diaspora frequently excel in science, technology, medicine, sports, arts and many other fields.\n21. Similarly, the creativity, ingenuity and resourcefulness of the Nigerian at home have resulted in globally recognized endeavours.\n22. I am convinced that if we pursue our aspirations TOGETHER we would be able to achieve whatever we desire. That informed our adopting the theme TOGETHER to mark this epochal event.\n23. Together we can change our condition for the better and more importantly, together we can do much more for ourselves and for our country.\n24. I chose the path of self-reflection because this is what I do on a daily basis and I must confess that at most times, I always felt the need for a collective reflection as I know that the foundation for a solid future which this administration is laying can only be sustainable if there is a collective commitment by Nigerians.\n25. Nigeria is not a country for Mr. President, any ruling or opposition party but a country for all of us and we must play our part, irrespective of challenges we face, to make this country what we desire.\n26. To achieve this, we must focus our minds, TOGETHER as a people, on ways of resolving the identified critical challenges that underlie our present state. These include:\na. Evolving and sustaining a democratic culture that leaves power in the hands of the people;\nb. Supporting the enthronement of the rule of law, demanding accountability of elected representatives and contributing to good governance;\nc. Increasing our commitment to peaceful co-existence in a peaceful, secure and united Nigeria;\nd. Harnessing and Optimizing our tremendous human and natural resources to attain our goal of being in the top twenty economies of the world and in the process;\ne. Lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years;\nf. Strengthening institutions to make them stronger in protecting National Interests; and\ng. Imbibing tolerance in diversity.\n27. I am a firm believer in transparent, free, fair and credible elections as has been demonstrated during my period as a democratically elected President.\n28. The recent build-up and eventual outcome of the Edo State elections should encourage Nigerians that it is my commitment to bequeath to this country processes and procedures that would guarantee that the people’s votes count.\n29. The problems with our electoral process are mainly human induced as desperate desire for power leads to desperate attempts to gain power and office.\n30. Democracy, the world over and as I am pursuing in Nigeria, recognizes the power of the people. However, if some constituencies choose to bargain off their power, they should be prepared for denial of their rights.\n31. This call is made more urgent if we realise that even after a transparent, free, fair and credible election, desperation leads to compromising the judiciary to upturn legitimate decisions of the people.\n32. It is necessary to, therefore support the enthronement of the rule of law by avoiding actions which compromise the judiciary.\n33. Fellow Nigerians, our history has shown that we are a people that have the capacity to live peacefully with one another.\n34. As a government, we remain committed to our constitutional oath of securing the lives and properties of the citizenry. I, however, call on the citizenry to also support government by providing the necessary community level intelligence in addressing these challenges.\n35. In moving forward together, it is important to strengthen our economy to provide sustainable means of livelihood for as many Nigerians as possible so as to eradicate absolute poverty from our midst.\n36. I want to re-emphasize my dedication and commitment, a dedication and commitment that propelled my public service career and informed my quest to continually seek for an opportunity to improve the lives of Nigerians, set the country on the path of prosperity and lead the country to a better future.\n37. This administration has been focused on rebuilding and laying the foundations for a sustainable Nigeria. Of course, we have met and are still meeting the challenges inherent in any rebuilding initiative – more so that of a nation like Nigeria that has undergone avoidable levels of deprivation – but can be surmounted if we all work together.\n38. I wish to re-iterate that our people and our spirit of excellence remains our most important asset.\n39. In this wise, the need to return to our age-old ethical and high moral values would be necessary and this informed my launching of the National Ethics and Integrity Policy on Monday 28th September, 2020.\n40. The policy would not implement itself and the first contact of the visibility of its implementation is the Public Service whose on-going reforms would be expected to be sustainable and give a radical re-direction in providing services to all Nigerians.\n41. Fellow Nigerians, in addition to public health challenges of working to contain the spread of the Coronavirus, we have suffered a significant drop in our foreign exchange earnings and internal revenues due to 40 per cent drop in oil prices and steep drop in economic activities, leading to a 60 per cent drop in government revenue.\n42. Our government is grappling with the dual challenge of saving lives and livelihoods in face of drastically reduced resources.\n43. In this regard, sustaining the level of petroleum prices is no longer possible. The government, since coming into office has recognized the economic argument for adjusting the price of petroleum. But the social argument about the knock-on effect of any adjustment weighed heavily with the government.\n44. Accordingly, in the last three years, we have introduced unprecedented measures in support of the economy and to the weakest members of our society in the shape of:\na. Tradermoni\nb. Farmermoni\nc. School Feeding Programme\nd. Job creation efforts\ne. Agricultural intervention programmes\n45. No government in the past did what we are doing with such scarce resources. We have managed to keep things going in spite of the disproportionate spending on security. Those in the previous Governments from 1999 – 2015 who presided over the near destruction of the country have now the impudence to attempt to criticize our efforts.\n46. In the circumstances, a responsible government must face realities and take tough decisions.\n47. Petroleum prices in Nigeria are to be adjusted. We sell now at N161 per litre. A comparison with our neighbours will illustrate the point;\na. Chad which is an oil producing country charges N362 per litre\nb. Niger, also an oil producing country sells 1 litre at N346.\nc. In Ghana, another oil producing country, petroleum pump price is N326 per litre.\n48. Further afield, Egypt charges N211 per litre. Saudi Arabia charges N168 per litre. It makes no sense for oil to be cheaper in Nigeria than in Saudi Arabia.\n49. Fellow Nigerians, to achieve the great country we desire, we need to solidify our strength, increase our commitment and encourage ourselves to do that which is right and proper even when no one is watching.\n50. Fellow Nigerians, let us collectively resolve to continue our journey beyond the sixty years on the clear understanding that as a nation we are greater together than being smaller units of nationalities. By the special grace of God we shall come through any transient challenges.\n51. It is my sincere hope that by the end of this anniversary on September 30th 2021, we will all be proud of taking this individual and collective self-assessment for the progress of our great Nation.\nLong Live the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\nGod Bless us all.

I am convinced that if we pursue our aspirations TOGETHER we would be able to achieve whatever we desire. That informed our adopting the theme TOGETHER to mark this epochal event.\n23. Together we can change our condition for the better and more importantly, together we can do much more for ourselves and for our country.\n24. I chose the path of self-reflection because this is what I do on a daily basis and I must confess that at most times, I always felt the need for a collective reflection as I know that the foundation for a solid future which this administration is laying can only be sustainable if there is a collective commitment by Nigerians.\n25. Nigeria is not a country for Mr. President, any ruling or opposition party but a country for all of us and we must play our part, irrespective of challenges we face, to make this country what we desire.\n26. To achieve this, we must focus our minds, TOGETHER as a people, on ways of resolving the identified critical challenges that underlie our present state. These include:\na. Evolving and sustaining a democratic culture that leaves power in the hands of the people;\nb. Supporting the enthronement of the rule of law, demanding accountability of elected representatives and contributing to good governance;\nc. Increasing our commitment to peaceful co-existence in a peaceful, secure and united Nigeria;\nd. Harnessing and Optimizing our tremendous human and natural resources to attain our goal of being in the top twenty economies of the world and in the process;\ne. Lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years;\nf. Strengthening institutions to make them stronger in protecting National Interests; and\ng. Imbibing tolerance in diversity.\n27. I am a firm believer in transparent, free, fair and credible elections as has been demonstrated during my period as a democratically elected President.\n28. The recent build-up and eventual outcome of the Edo State elections should encourage Nigerians that it is my commitment to bequeath to this country processes and procedures that would guarantee that the people’s votes count.\n29. The problems with our electoral process are mainly human induced as desperate desire for power leads to desperate attempts to gain power and office.\n30. Democracy, the world over and as I am pursuing in Nigeria, recognizes the power of the people. However, if some constituencies choose to bargain off their power, they should be prepared for denial of their rights.\n31. This call is made more urgent if we realise that even after a transparent, free, fair and credible election, desperation leads to compromising the judiciary to upturn legitimate decisions of the people.\n32. It is necessary to, therefore support the enthronement of the rule of law by avoiding actions which compromise the judiciary.\n33. Fellow Nigerians, our history has shown that we are a people that have the capacity to live peacefully with one another.\n34. As a government, we remain committed to our constitutional oath of securing the lives and properties of the citizenry. I, however, call on the citizenry to also support government by providing the necessary community level intelligence in addressing these challenges.\n35. In moving forward together, it is important to strengthen our economy to provide sustainable means of livelihood for as many Nigerians as possible so as to eradicate absolute poverty from our midst.\n36. I want to re-emphasize my dedication and commitment, a dedication and commitment that propelled my public service career and informed my quest to continually seek for an opportunity to improve the lives of Nigerians, set the country on the path of prosperity and lead the country to a better future.\n37. This administration has been focused on rebuilding and laying the foundations for a sustainable Nigeria. Of course, we have met and are still meeting the challenges inherent in any rebuilding initiative – more so that of a nation like Nigeria that has undergone avoidable levels of deprivation – but can be surmounted if we all work together.\n38. I wish to re-iterate that our people and our spirit of excellence remains our most important asset.\n39. In this wise, the need to return to our age-old ethical and high moral values would be necessary and this informed my launching of the National Ethics and Integrity Policy on Monday 28th September, 2020.\n40. The policy would not implement itself and the first contact of the visibility of its implementation is the Public Service whose on-going reforms would be expected to be sustainable and give a radical re-direction in providing services to all Nigerians.\n41. Fellow Nigerians, in addition to public health challenges of working to contain the spread of the Coronavirus, we have suffered a significant drop in our foreign exchange earnings and internal revenues due to 40 per cent drop in oil prices and steep drop in economic activities, leading to a 60 per cent drop in government revenue.\n42. Our government is grappling with the dual challenge of saving lives and livelihoods in face of drastically reduced resources.\n43. In this regard, sustaining the level of petroleum prices is no longer possible. The government, since coming into office has recognized the economic argument for adjusting the price of petroleum. But the social argument about the knock-on effect of any adjustment weighed heavily with the government.\n44. Accordingly, in the last three years, we have introduced unprecedented measures in support of the economy and to the weakest members of our society in the shape of:\na. Tradermoni\nb. Farmermoni\nc. School Feeding Programme\nd. Job creation efforts\ne. Agricultural intervention programmes\n45. No government in the past did what we are doing with such scarce resources. We have managed to keep things going in spite of the disproportionate spending on security. Those in the previous Governments from 1999 – 2015 who presided over the near destruction of the country have now the impudence to attempt to criticize our efforts.\n46. In the circumstances, a responsible government must face realities and take tough decisions.\n47. Petroleum prices in Nigeria are to be adjusted. We sell now at N161 per litre. A comparison with our neighbours will illustrate the point;\na. Chad which is an oil producing country charges N362 per litre\nb. Niger, also an oil producing country sells 1 litre at N346.\nc. In Ghana, another oil producing country, petroleum pump price is N326 per litre.\n48. Further afield, Egypt charges N211 per litre. Saudi Arabia charges N168 per litre. It makes no sense for oil to be cheaper in Nigeria than in Saudi Arabia.\n49. Fellow Nigerians, to achieve the great country we desire, we need to solidify our strength, increase our commitment and encourage ourselves to do that which is right and proper even when no one is watching.\n50. Fellow Nigerians, let us collectively resolve to continue our journey beyond the sixty years on the clear understanding that as a nation we are greater together than being smaller units of nationalities. By the special grace of God we shall come through any transient challenges.\n51. It is my sincere hope that by the end of this anniversary on September 30th 2021, we will all be proud of taking this individual and collective self-assessment for the progress of our great Nation.\nLong Live the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\nGod Bless us all.

As President, I wish to renew my appreciation to Nigerians for entrusting me with your hopes and aspirations for a better and greater Nigeria.\n2. Today, it is my unique privilege to re-commit myself to the service of this great country of great people with profound diversities and opportunities. We are bound by destiny to be the largest and greatest black nation on earth.\n3. At this stage in our nationhood it is important that we reflect how we got here to enable us work TOGETHER to get to where we aspire to be as a strong indivisible nation, united in hope and equal in opportunity.\n4. On October 1st 1960 when Prime Minister Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa received the constitutional instruments symbolizing Nigeria’s independence, he expressed his wish that having acquired our rightful status as an independent sovereign nation, history would record that the building of our nation proceeded at the wisest pace.\n5. This optimism was anchored on the peaceful planning, full and open consultation and harmonious cooperation with the different groups which culminated in Nigeria emerging as a country without bitterness and bloodshed.\n6. Our founding fathers understood the imperative of structuring a National identity using the power of the state and worked towards unification of Nigerians in a politically stable and viable entity.\n7. That philosophy guided the foundation that was laid for our young nation of 45 million people with an urban population of approximately 7million occupying an area of 910,768 square kilometers. These demographics led to development challenges for which major efforts were made to overcome.\n8. Today, we grapple with multiple challenges with a population exceeding 200million occupying the same land mass but 52% residing in urban areas.\n9. Sixty years of nationhood provides an opportunity to ask ourselves questions on the extent to which we have sustained the aspirations of our founding fathers. Where did we do the right things? Are we on course? If not where did we stray and how can we remedy and retrace our steps?\n10. Upon attaining independence, Nigeria’s growth trajectory was anchored on policies and programmes that positively impacted on all sectors of the economy. However, this journey was cut short by the 30-months of civil war.\n11. We came out of the civil war with a focus on reconstruction, rehabilitation and reconciliation that enabled the country to put in place world-class development structures and a strengthened public service that well served the government. This positive trajectory continued with a return to democratic government which was truncated by another round of military rule.\n12. For a cumulative 29 of our 60 years existence as a nation, we have been under military rule.\n13. My summary of our journey so far as a nation is necessary to appropriately chart where we need to go and how to get there TOGETHER.\n14. Today, I am aware that our economy along with every single economy in the world is in crisis. We still face security challenges in parts of the country, while our society suffers from a high loss of moral rectitude which is driven by unbridled craving for political control.\n15. An underlying cause of most of the problems we have faced as a nation is our consistent harping on artificially contrived fault-lines that we have harboured and allowed unnecessarily to fester.\n16. In addition, institutions such as civil service, police, the judiciary, the military all suffered from a general decline.\n17. We need to begin a sincere process of national healing and this anniversary presents a genuine opportunity to eliminate old and outworn perceptions that are always put to test in the lie they always are.\n18. The stereotype of thinking of ourselves as coming from one part of the country before seeing ourselves as Nigerians is a key starting point to project us on the road to our deserved nation’s evolution and integration.\n19. To start this healing process, we are already blessed with the most important asset any nation requires for such – OUR PEOPLE – and this has manifested globally in the exploits of Nigerians in many fields.\n20. It has been demonstrated time and time again that Nigerians in the diaspora frequently excel in science, technology, medicine, sports, arts and many other fields.\n21. Similarly, the creativity, ingenuity and resourcefulness of the Nigerian at home have resulted in globally recognized endeavours.\n22. I am convinced that if we pursue our aspirations TOGETHER we would be able to achieve whatever we desire. That informed our adopting the theme TOGETHER to mark this epochal event.\n23.

As President, I wish to renew my appreciation to Nigerians for entrusting me with your hopes and aspirations for a better and greater Nigeria.\n2. Today, it is my unique privilege to re-commit myself to the service of this great country of great people with profound diversities and opportunities. We are bound by destiny to be the largest and greatest black nation on earth.\n3. At this stage in our nationhood it is important that we reflect how we got here to enable us work TOGETHER to get to where we aspire to be as a strong indivisible nation, united in hope and equal in opportunity.\n4. On October 1st 1960 when Prime Minister Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa received the constitutional instruments symbolizing Nigeria’s independence, he expressed his wish that having acquired our rightful status as an independent sovereign nation, history would record that the building of our nation proceeded at the wisest pace.\n5. This optimism was anchored on the peaceful planning, full and open consultation and harmonious cooperation with the different groups which culminated in Nigeria emerging as a country without bitterness and bloodshed.\n6. Our founding fathers understood the imperative of structuring a National identity using the power of the state and worked towards unification of Nigerians in a politically stable and viable entity.\n7. That philosophy guided the foundation that was laid for our young nation of 45 million people with an urban population of approximately 7million occupying an area of 910,768 square kilometers. These demographics led to development challenges for which major efforts were made to overcome.\n8. Today, we grapple with multiple challenges with a population exceeding 200million occupying the same land mass but 52% residing in urban areas.\n9. Sixty years of nationhood provides an opportunity to ask ourselves questions on the extent to which we have sustained the aspirations of our founding fathers. Where did we do the right things? Are we on course? If not where did we stray and how can we remedy and retrace our steps?\n10. Upon attaining independence, Nigeria’s growth trajectory was anchored on policies and programmes that positively impacted on all sectors of the economy. However, this journey was cut short by the 30-months of civil war.\n11. We came out of the civil war with a focus on reconstruction, rehabilitation and reconciliation that enabled the country to put in place world-class development structures and a strengthened public service that well served the government. This positive trajectory continued with a return to democratic government which was truncated by another round of military rule.\n12. For a cumulative 29 of our 60 years existence as a nation, we have been under military rule.\n13. My summary of our journey so far as a nation is necessary to appropriately chart where we need to go and how to get there TOGETHER.\n14. Today, I am aware that our economy along with every single economy in the world is in crisis. We still face security challenges in parts of the country, while our society suffers from a high loss of moral rectitude which is driven by unbridled craving for political control.\n15. An underlying cause of most of the problems we have faced as a nation is our consistent harping on artificially contrived fault-lines that we have harboured and allowed unnecessarily to fester.\n16. In addition, institutions such as civil service, police, the judiciary, the military all suffered from a general decline.\n17. We need to begin a sincere process of national healing and this anniversary presents a genuine opportunity to eliminate old and outworn perceptions that are always put to test in the lie they always are.\n18. The stereotype of thinking of ourselves as coming from one part of the country before seeing ourselves as Nigerians is a key starting point to project us on the road to our deserved nation’s evolution and integration.\n19. To start this healing process, we are already blessed with the most important asset any nation requires for such – OUR PEOPLE – and this has manifested globally in the exploits of Nigerians in many fields.\n20. It has been demonstrated time and time again that Nigerians in the diaspora frequently excel in science, technology, medicine, sports, arts and many other fields.\n21. Similarly, the creativity, ingenuity and resourcefulness of the Nigerian at home have resulted in globally recognized endeavours.\n22. I am convinced that if we pursue our aspirations TOGETHER we would be able to achieve whatever we desire. That informed our adopting the theme TOGETHER to mark this epochal event.\n23. Together we can change our condition for the better and more importantly, together we can do much more for ourselves and for our country.\n24. I chose the path of self-reflection because this is what I do on a daily basis and I must confess that at most times, I always felt the need for a collective reflection as I know that the foundation for a solid future which this administration is laying can only be sustainable if there is a collective commitment by Nigerians.\n25. Nigeria is not a country for Mr. President, any ruling or opposition party but a country for all of us and we must play our part, irrespective of challenges we face, to make this country what we desire.\n26. To achieve this, we must focus our minds, TOGETHER as a people, on ways of resolving the identified critical challenges that underlie our present state. These include:\na. Evolving and sustaining a democratic culture that leaves power in the hands of the people;\nb. Supporting the enthronement of the rule of law, demanding accountability of elected representatives and contributing to good governance;\nc. Increasing our commitment to peaceful co-existence in a peaceful, secure and united Nigeria;\nd. Harnessing and Optimizing our tremendous human and natural resources to attain our goal of being in the top twenty economies of the world and in the process;\ne. Lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years;\nf. Strengthening institutions to make them stronger in protecting National Interests; and\ng. Imbibing tolerance in diversity.\n27. I am a firm believer in transparent, free, fair and credible elections as has been demonstrated during my period as a democratically elected President.\n28. The recent build-up and eventual outcome of the Edo State elections should encourage Nigerians that it is my commitment to bequeath to this country processes and procedures that would guarantee that the people’s votes count.\n29. The problems with our electoral process are mainly human induced as desperate desire for power leads to desperate attempts to gain power and office.\n30. Democracy, the world over and as I am pursuing in Nigeria, recognizes the power of the people. However, if some constituencies choose to bargain off their power, they should be prepared for denial of their rights.\n31. This call is made more urgent if we realise that even after a transparent, free, fair and credible election, desperation leads to compromising the judiciary to upturn legitimate decisions of the people.\n32. It is necessary to, therefore support the enthronement of the rule of law by avoiding actions which compromise the judiciary.\n33. Fellow Nigerians, our history has shown that we are a people that have the capacity to live peacefully with one another.\n34. As a government, we remain committed to our constitutional oath of securing the lives and properties of the citizenry. I, however, call on the citizenry to also support government by providing the necessary community level intelligence in addressing these challenges.\n35. In moving forward together, it is important to strengthen our economy to provide sustainable means of livelihood for as many Nigerians as possible so as to eradicate absolute poverty from our midst.\n36. I want to re-emphasize my dedication and commitment, a dedication and commitment that propelled my public service career and informed my quest to continually seek for an opportunity to improve the lives of Nigerians, set the country on the path of prosperity and lead the country to a better future.\n37. This administration has been focused on rebuilding and laying the foundations for a sustainable Nigeria. Of course, we have met and are still meeting the challenges inherent in any rebuilding initiative – more so that of a nation like Nigeria that has undergone avoidable levels of deprivation – but can be surmounted if we all work together.\n38. I wish to re-iterate that our people and our spirit of excellence remains our most important asset.\n39. In this wise, the need to return to our age-old ethical and high moral values would be necessary and this informed my launching of the National Ethics and Integrity Policy on Monday 28th September, 2020.\n40. The policy would not implement itself and the first contact of the visibility of its implementation is the Public Service whose on-going reforms would be expected to be sustainable and give a radical re-direction in providing services to all Nigerians.\n41. Fellow Nigerians, in addition to public health challenges of working to contain the spread of the Coronavirus, we have suffered a significant drop in our foreign exchange earnings and internal revenues due to 40 per cent drop in oil prices and steep drop in economic activities, leading to a 60 per cent drop in government revenue.\n42. Our government is grappling with the dual challenge of saving lives and livelihoods in face of drastically reduced resources.\n43. In this regard, sustaining the level of petroleum prices is no longer possible. The government, since coming into office has recognized the economic argument for adjusting the price of petroleum. But the social argument about the knock-on effect of any adjustment weighed heavily with the government.\n44. Accordingly, in the last three years, we have introduced unprecedented measures in support of the economy and to the weakest members of our society in the shape of:\na. Tradermoni\nb. Farmermoni\nc. School Feeding Programme\nd. Job creation efforts\ne. Agricultural intervention programmes\n45. No government in the past did what we are doing with such scarce resources. We have managed to keep things going in spite of the disproportionate spending on security. Those in the previous Governments from 1999 – 2015 who presided over the near destruction of the country have now the impudence to attempt to criticize our efforts.\n46. In the circumstances, a responsible government must face realities and take tough decisions.\n47. Petroleum prices in Nigeria are to be adjusted. We sell now at N161 per litre. A comparison with our neighbours will illustrate the point;\na. Chad which is an oil producing country charges N362 per litre\nb. Niger, also an oil producing country sells 1 litre at N346.\nc.

Fellow Nigerians, let us collectively resolve to continue our journey beyond the sixty years on the clear understanding that as a nation we are greater together than being smaller units of nationalities. By the special grace of God we shall come through any transient challenges.\n51. It is my sincere hope that by the end of this anniversary on September 30th 2021, we will all be proud of taking this individual and collective self-assessment for the progress of our great Nation.\nLong Live the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\nGod Bless us all.

We came out of the civil war with a focus on reconstruction, rehabilitation and reconciliation that enabled the country to put in place world-class development structures and a strengthened public service that well served the government. This positive trajectory continued with a return to democratic government which was truncated by another round of military rule.\n12. For a cumulative 29 of our 60 years existence as a nation, we have been under military rule.\n13. My summary of our journey so far as a nation is necessary to appropriately chart where we need to go and how to get there TOGETHER.\n14. Today, I am aware that our economy along with every single economy in the world is in crisis. We still face security challenges in parts of the country, while our society suffers from a high loss of moral rectitude which is driven by unbridled craving for political control.\n15. An underlying cause of most of the problems we have faced as a nation is our consistent harping on artificially contrived fault-lines that we have harboured and allowed unnecessarily to fester.\n16. In addition, institutions such as civil service, police, the judiciary, the military all suffered from a general decline.\n17. We need to begin a sincere process of national healing and this anniversary presents a genuine opportunity to eliminate old and outworn perceptions that are always put to test in the lie they always are.\n18. The stereotype of thinking of ourselves as coming from one part of the country before seeing ourselves as Nigerians is a key starting point to project us on the road to our deserved nation’s evolution and integration.\n19. To start this healing process, we are already blessed with the most important asset any nation requires for such – OUR PEOPLE – and this has manifested globally in the exploits of Nigerians in many fields.\n20. It has been demonstrated time and time again that Nigerians in the diaspora frequently excel in science, technology, medicine, sports, arts and many other fields.\n21. Similarly, the creativity, ingenuity and resourcefulness of the Nigerian at home have resulted in globally recognized endeavours.\n22. I am convinced that if we pursue our aspirations TOGETHER we would be able to achieve whatever we desire. That informed our adopting the theme TOGETHER to mark this epochal event.\n23. Together we can change our condition for the better and more importantly, together we can do much more for ourselves and for our country.\n24. I chose the path of self-reflection because this is what I do on a daily basis and I must confess that at most times, I always felt the need for a collective reflection as I know that the foundation for a solid future which this administration is laying can only be sustainable if there is a collective commitment by Nigerians.\n25. Nigeria is not a country for Mr. President, any ruling or opposition party but a country for all of us and we must play our part, irrespective of challenges we face, to make this country what we desire.\n26. To achieve this, we must focus our minds, TOGETHER as a people, on ways of resolving the identified critical challenges that underlie our present state. These include:\na. Evolving and sustaining a democratic culture that leaves power in the hands of the people;\nb. Supporting the enthronement of the rule of law, demanding accountability of elected representatives and contributing to good governance;\nc. Increasing our commitment to peaceful co-existence in a peaceful, secure and united Nigeria;\nd. Harnessing and Optimizing our tremendous human and natural resources to attain our goal of being in the top twenty economies of the world and in the process;\ne. Lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years;\nf. Strengthening institutions to make them stronger in protecting National Interests; and\ng. Imbibing tolerance in diversity.\n27. I am a firm believer in transparent, free, fair and credible elections as has been demonstrated during my period as a democratically elected President.\n28. The recent build-up and eventual outcome of the Edo State elections should encourage Nigerians that it is my commitment to bequeath to this country processes and procedures that would guarantee that the people’s votes count.\n29. The problems with our electoral process are mainly human induced as desperate desire for power leads to desperate attempts to gain power and office.\n30. Democracy, the world over and as I am pursuing in Nigeria, recognizes the power of the people. However, if some constituencies choose to bargain off their power, they should be prepared for denial of their rights.\n31. This call is made more urgent if we realise that even after a transparent, free, fair and credible election, desperation leads to compromising the judiciary to upturn legitimate decisions of the people.\n32. It is necessary to, therefore support the enthronement of the rule of law by avoiding actions which compromise the judiciary.\n33. Fellow Nigerians, our history has shown that we are a people that have the capacity to live peacefully with one another.\n34. As a government, we remain committed to our constitutional oath of securing the lives and properties of the citizenry. I, however, call on the citizenry to also support government by providing the necessary community level intelligence in addressing these challenges.\n35. In moving forward together, it is important to strengthen our economy to provide sustainable means of livelihood for as many Nigerians as possible so as to eradicate absolute poverty from our midst.\n36. I want to re-emphasize my dedication and commitment, a dedication and commitment that propelled my public service career and informed my quest to continually seek for an opportunity to improve the lives of Nigerians, set the country on the path of prosperity and lead the country to a better future.\n37. This administration has been focused on rebuilding and laying the foundations for a sustainable Nigeria. Of course, we have met and are still meeting the challenges inherent in any rebuilding initiative – more so that of a nation like Nigeria that has undergone avoidable levels of deprivation – but can be surmounted if we all work together.\n38. I wish to re-iterate that our people and our spirit of excellence remains our most important asset.\n39. In this wise, the need to return to our age-old ethical and high moral values would be necessary and this informed my launching of the National Ethics and Integrity Policy on Monday 28th September, 2020.\n40.

Our government is grappling with the dual challenge of saving lives and livelihoods in face of drastically reduced resources.\n43.

School Feeding Programme\nd. Job creation efforts\ne. Agricultural intervention programmes\n45. No government in the past did what we are doing with such scarce resources. We have managed to keep things going in spite of the disproportionate spending on security. Those in the previous Governments from 1999 – 2015 who presided over the near destruction of the country have now the impudence to attempt to criticize our efforts.\n46. In the circumstances, a responsible government must face realities and take tough decisions.\n47. Petroleum prices in Nigeria are to be adjusted. We sell now at N161 per litre. A comparison with our neighbours will illustrate the point;\na. Chad which is an oil producing country charges N362 per litre\nb. Niger, also an oil producing country sells 1 litre at N346.\nc. In Ghana, another oil producing country, petroleum pump price is N326 per litre.\n48. Further afield, Egypt charges N211 per litre. Saudi Arabia charges N168 per litre. It makes no sense for oil to be cheaper in Nigeria than in Saudi Arabia.\n49. Fellow Nigerians, to achieve the great country we desire, we need to solidify our strength, increase our commitment and encourage ourselves to do that which is right and proper even when no one is watching.\n50. Fellow Nigerians, let us collectively resolve to continue our journey beyond the sixty years on the clear understanding that as a nation we are greater together than being smaller units of nationalities. By the special grace of God we shall come through any transient challenges.\n51. It is my sincere hope that by the end of this anniversary on September 30th 2021, we will all be proud of taking this individual and collective self-assessment for the progress of our great Nation.\nLong Live the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\nGod Bless us all.

As President, I wish to renew my appreciation to Nigerians for entrusting me with your hopes and aspirations for a better and greater Nigeria.\n2. Today, it is my unique privilege to re-commit myself to the service of this great country of great people with profound diversities and opportunities. We are bound by destiny to be the largest and greatest black nation on earth.\n3. At this stage in our nationhood it is important that we reflect how we got here to enable us work TOGETHER to get to where we aspire to be as a strong indivisible nation, united in hope and equal in opportunity.\n4. On October 1st 1960 when Prime Minister Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa received the constitutional instruments symbolizing Nigeria’s independence, he expressed his wish that having acquired our rightful status as an independent sovereign nation, history would record that the building of our nation proceeded at the wisest pace.\n5. This optimism was anchored on the peaceful planning, full and open consultation and harmonious cooperation with the different groups which culminated in Nigeria emerging as a country without bitterness and bloodshed.\n6. Our founding fathers understood the imperative of structuring a National identity using the power of the state and worked towards unification of Nigerians in a politically stable and viable entity.\n7. That philosophy guided the foundation that was laid for our young nation of 45 million people with an urban population of approximately 7million occupying an area of 910,768 square kilometers. These demographics led to development challenges for which major efforts were made to overcome.\n8. Today, we grapple with multiple challenges with a population exceeding 200million occupying the same land mass but 52% residing in urban areas.\n9. Sixty years of nationhood provides an opportunity to ask ourselves questions on the extent to which we have sustained the aspirations of our founding fathers. Where did we do the right things? Are we on course? If not where did we stray and how can we remedy and retrace our steps?\n10. Upon attaining independence, Nigeria’s growth trajectory was anchored on policies and programmes that positively impacted on all sectors of the economy. However, this journey was cut short by the 30-months of civil war.\n11. We came out of the civil war with a focus on reconstruction, rehabilitation and reconciliation that enabled the country to put in place world-class development structures and a strengthened public service that well served the government. This positive trajectory continued with a return to democratic government which was truncated by another round of military rule.\n12. For a cumulative 29 of our 60 years existence as a nation, we have been under military rule.\n13. My summary of our journey so far as a nation is necessary to appropriately chart where we need to go and how to get there TOGETHER.\n14. Today, I am aware that our economy along with every single economy in the world is in crisis. We still face security challenges in parts of the country, while our society suffers from a high loss of moral rectitude which is driven by unbridled craving for political control.\n15. An underlying cause of most of the problems we have faced as a nation is our consistent harping on artificially contrived fault-lines that we have harboured and allowed unnecessarily to fester.\n16. In addition, institutions such as civil service, police, the judiciary, the military all suffered from a general decline.\n17. We need to begin a sincere process of national healing and this anniversary presents a genuine opportunity to eliminate old and outworn perceptions that are always put to test in the lie they always are.\n18. The stereotype of thinking of ourselves as coming from one part of the country before seeing ourselves as Nigerians is a key starting point to project us on the road to our deserved nation’s evolution and integration.\n19. To start this healing process, we are already blessed with the most important asset any nation requires for such – OUR PEOPLE – and this has manifested globally in the exploits of Nigerians in many fields.\n20. It has been demonstrated time and time again that Nigerians in the diaspora frequently excel in science, technology, medicine, sports, arts and many other fields.\n21. Similarly, the creativity, ingenuity and resourcefulness of the Nigerian at home have resulted in globally recognized endeavours.\n22. I am convinced that if we pursue our aspirations TOGETHER we would be able to achieve whatever we desire. That informed our adopting the theme TOGETHER to mark this epochal event.\n23. Together we can change our condition for the better and more importantly, together we can do much more for ourselves and for our country.\n24. I chose the path of self-reflection because this is what I do on a daily basis and I must confess that at most times, I always felt the need for a collective reflection as I know that the foundation for a solid future which this administration is laying can only be sustainable if there is a collective commitment by Nigerians.\n25. Nigeria is not a country for Mr. President, any ruling or opposition party but a country for all of us and we must play our part, irrespective of challenges we face, to make this country what we desire.\n26. To achieve this, we must focus our minds, TOGETHER as a people, on ways of resolving the identified critical challenges that underlie our present state. These include:\na. Evolving and sustaining a democratic culture that leaves power in the hands of the people;\nb. Supporting the enthronement of the rule of law, demanding accountability of elected representatives and contributing to good governance;\nc. Increasing our commitment to peaceful co-existence in a peaceful, secure and united Nigeria;\nd. Harnessing and Optimizing our tremendous human and natural resources to attain our goal of being in the top twenty economies of the world and in the process;\ne. Lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years;\nf. Strengthening institutions to make them stronger in protecting National Interests; and\ng. Imbibing tolerance in diversity.\n27. I am a firm believer in transparent, free, fair and credible elections as has been demonstrated during my period as a democratically elected President.\n28. The recent build-up and eventual outcome of the Edo State elections should encourage Nigerians that it is my commitment to bequeath to this country processes and procedures that would guarantee that the people’s votes count.\n29. The problems with our electoral process are mainly human induced as desperate desire for power leads to desperate attempts to gain power and office.\n30. Democracy, the world over and as I am pursuing in Nigeria, recognizes the power of the people. However, if some constituencies choose to bargain off their power, they should be prepared for denial of their rights.\n31. This call is made more urgent if we realise that even after a transparent, free, fair and credible election, desperation leads to compromising the judiciary to upturn legitimate decisions of the people.\n32.

What are the five major challenges Buhari is facing? An overview. 1. Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram\n\nHe promised to defeat the islamist terror group Boko Haram. Since his election in March 2015, Buhari has been able to curb the influence of the Islamist extremists. But although the president in December 2015 said that Boko Haram was \"technically defeated,\" the islamists continue to attack. The terrorist group is said to be responsible for an attack in Maiduguri on Wednesday that left eight people dead.\n\nStill unclear is under what circumstances the 21 Chibok schoolgirls were released on Thursday. According to local sources, the girls were swapped for Boko Haram prisoners. The Nigerian government has denied this. Over two years ago, Boko Haram kidnapped 276 Nigerian schoolgirls from Chibok. The Chibok girls became a symbol of the Boko Haram terror. Although the Nigerian military was able to claw back territory from from Boko Haram, Buhari has been under criticism, because he wasn't - until this week - able to free any of the girls.\n\nAnd in the northeastern part of the country, the population still faces a humanitarian crisis because of Boko Haram. UNICEF workers are referring to the worst situation of hunger in the world. More than three million people in the region have been forced out of their homes. Aid agencies can only reach many of the refugee camps by helicopter - the streets are very insecure. Oxfam workers accuse the army of doing nothing in the region instead of securing access roads for aid agencies. 2. Economic slump\n\nThe fight against Boko Haram is costing Buhari a lot of money and it is running out. The price of oil has gone down by half since mid 2014, likewise oil production has sunk drastically due to sabotage by rebels in the Niger Delta - Buhari's next problem.

As President, I wish to renew my appreciation to Nigerians for entrusting me with your hopes and aspirations for a better and greater Nigeria.\n2. Today, it is my unique privilege to re-commit myself to the service of this great country of great people with profound diversities and opportunities. We are bound by destiny to be the largest and greatest black nation on earth.\n3. At this stage in our nationhood it is important that we reflect how we got here to enable us work TOGETHER to get to where we aspire to be as a strong indivisible nation, united in hope and equal in opportunity.\n4. On October 1st 1960 when Prime Minister Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa received the constitutional instruments symbolizing Nigeria’s independence, he expressed his wish that having acquired our rightful status as an independent sovereign nation, history would record that the building of our nation proceeded at the wisest pace.\n5. This optimism was anchored on the peaceful planning, full and open consultation and harmonious cooperation with the different groups which culminated in Nigeria emerging as a country without bitterness and bloodshed.\n6. Our founding fathers understood the imperative of structuring a National identity using the power of the state and worked towards unification of Nigerians in a politically stable and viable entity.\n7. That philosophy guided the foundation that was laid for our young nation of 45 million people with an urban population of approximately 7million occupying an area of 910,768 square kilometers. These demographics led to development challenges for which major efforts were made to overcome.\n8. Today, we grapple with multiple challenges with a population exceeding 200million occupying the same land mass but 52% residing in urban areas.\n9. Sixty years of nationhood provides an opportunity to ask ourselves questions on the extent to which we have sustained the aspirations of our founding fathers. Where did we do the right things? Are we on course? If not where did we stray and how can we remedy and retrace our steps?\n10. Upon attaining independence, Nigeria’s growth trajectory was anchored on policies and programmes that positively impacted on all sectors of the economy. However, this journey was cut short by the 30-months of civil war.\n11. We came out of the civil war with a focus on reconstruction, rehabilitation and reconciliation that enabled the country to put in place world-class development structures and a strengthened public service that well served the government. This positive trajectory continued with a return to democratic government which was truncated by another round of military rule.\n12. For a cumulative 29 of our 60 years existence as a nation, we have been under military rule.\n13. My summary of our journey so far as a nation is necessary to appropriately chart where we need to go and how to get there TOGETHER.\n14. Today, I am aware that our economy along with every single economy in the world is in crisis. We still face security challenges in parts of the country, while our society suffers from a high loss of moral rectitude which is driven by unbridled craving for political control.\n15. An underlying cause of most of the problems we have faced as a nation is our consistent harping on artificially contrived fault-lines that we have harboured and allowed unnecessarily to fester.\n16. In addition, institutions such as civil service, police, the judiciary, the military all suffered from a general decline.\n17. We need to begin a sincere process of national healing and this anniversary presents a genuine opportunity to eliminate old and outworn perceptions that are always put to test in the lie they always are.\n18. The stereotype of thinking of ourselves as coming from one part of the country before seeing ourselves as Nigerians is a key starting point to project us on the road to our deserved nation’s evolution and integration.\n19. To start this healing process, we are already blessed with the most important asset any nation requires for such – OUR PEOPLE – and this has manifested globally in the exploits of Nigerians in many fields.\n20. It has been demonstrated time and time again that Nigerians in the diaspora frequently excel in science, technology, medicine, sports, arts and many other fields.\n21. Similarly, the creativity, ingenuity and resourcefulness of the Nigerian at home have resulted in globally recognized endeavours.\n22. I am convinced that if we pursue our aspirations TOGETHER we would be able to achieve whatever we desire. That informed our adopting the theme TOGETHER to mark this epochal event.\n23. Together we can change our condition for the better and more importantly, together we can do much more for ourselves and for our country.\n24. I chose the path of self-reflection because this is what I do on a daily basis and I must confess that at most times, I always felt the need for a collective reflection as I know that the foundation for a solid future which this administration is laying can only be sustainable if there is a collective commitment by Nigerians.\n25. Nigeria is not a country for Mr. President, any ruling or opposition party but a country for all of us and we must play our part, irrespective of challenges we face, to make this country what we desire.\n26. To achieve this, we must focus our minds, TOGETHER as a people, on ways of resolving the identified critical challenges that underlie our present state. These include:\na. Evolving and sustaining a democratic culture that leaves power in the hands of the people;\nb. Supporting the enthronement of the rule of law, demanding accountability of elected representatives and contributing to good governance;\nc. Increasing our commitment to peaceful co-existence in a peaceful, secure and united Nigeria;\nd. Harnessing and Optimizing our tremendous human and natural resources to attain our goal of being in the top twenty economies of the world and in the process;\ne. Lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years;\nf. Strengthening institutions to make them stronger in protecting National Interests; and\ng. Imbibing tolerance in diversity.\n27. I am a firm believer in transparent, free, fair and credible elections as has been demonstrated during my period as a democratically elected President.\n28. The recent build-up and eventual outcome of the Edo State elections should encourage Nigerians that it is my commitment to bequeath to this country processes and procedures that would guarantee that the people’s votes count.\n29. The problems with our electoral process are mainly human induced as desperate desire for power leads to desperate attempts to gain power and office.\n30. Democracy, the world over and as I am pursuing in Nigeria, recognizes the power of the people. However, if some constituencies choose to bargain off their power, they should be prepared for denial of their rights.\n31. This call is made more urgent if we realise that even after a transparent, free, fair and credible election, desperation leads to compromising the judiciary to upturn legitimate decisions of the people.\n32. It is necessary to, therefore support the enthronement of the rule of law by avoiding actions which compromise the judiciary.\n33. Fellow Nigerians, our history has shown that we are a people that have the capacity to live peacefully with one another.\n34. As a government, we remain committed to our constitutional oath of securing the lives and properties of the citizenry. I, however, call on the citizenry to also support government by providing the necessary community level intelligence in addressing these challenges.\n35. In moving forward together, it is important to strengthen our economy to provide sustainable means of livelihood for as many Nigerians as possible so as to eradicate absolute poverty from our midst.\n36. I want to re-emphasize my dedication and commitment, a dedication and commitment that propelled my public service career and informed my quest to continually seek for an opportunity to improve the lives of Nigerians, set the country on the path of prosperity and lead the country to a better future.\n37. This administration has been focused on rebuilding and laying the foundations for a sustainable Nigeria. Of course, we have met and are still meeting the challenges inherent in any rebuilding initiative – more so that of a nation like Nigeria that has undergone avoidable levels of deprivation – but can be surmounted if we all work together.\n38. I wish to re-iterate that our people and our spirit of excellence remains our most important asset.\n39. In this wise, the need to return to our age-old ethical and high moral values would be necessary and this informed my launching of the National Ethics and Integrity Policy on Monday 28th September, 2020.\n40. The policy would not implement itself and the first contact of the visibility of its implementation is the Public Service whose on-going reforms would be expected to be sustainable and give a radical re-direction in providing services to all Nigerians.\n41. Fellow Nigerians, in addition to public health challenges of working to contain the spread of the Coronavirus, we have suffered a significant drop in our foreign exchange earnings and internal revenues due to 40 per cent drop in oil prices and steep drop in economic activities, leading to a 60 per cent drop in government revenue.\n42. Our government is grappling with the dual challenge of saving lives and livelihoods in face of drastically reduced resources.\n43. In this regard, sustaining the level of petroleum prices is no longer possible. The government, since coming into office has recognized the economic argument for adjusting the price of petroleum. But the social argument about the knock-on effect of any adjustment weighed heavily with the government.\n44. Accordingly, in the last three years, we have introduced unprecedented measures in support of the economy and to the weakest members of our society in the shape of:\na. Tradermoni\nb. Farmermoni\nc. School Feeding Programme\nd. Job creation efforts\ne. Agricultural intervention programmes\n45. No government in the past did what we are doing with such scarce resources.

As President, I wish to renew my appreciation to Nigerians for entrusting me with your hopes and aspirations for a better and greater Nigeria.\n2. Today, it is my unique privilege to re-commit myself to the service of this great country of great people with profound diversities and opportunities. We are bound by destiny to be the largest and greatest black nation on earth.\n3. At this stage in our nationhood it is important that we reflect how we got here to enable us work TOGETHER to get to where we aspire to be as a strong indivisible nation, united in hope and equal in opportunity.\n4. On October 1st 1960 when Prime Minister Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa received the constitutional instruments symbolizing Nigeria’s independence, he expressed his wish that having acquired our rightful status as an independent sovereign nation, history would record that the building of our nation proceeded at the wisest pace.\n5. This optimism was anchored on the peaceful planning, full and open consultation and harmonious cooperation with the different groups which culminated in Nigeria emerging as a country without bitterness and bloodshed.\n6. Our founding fathers understood the imperative of structuring a National identity using the power of the state and worked towards unification of Nigerians in a politically stable and viable entity.\n7. That philosophy guided the foundation that was laid for our young nation of 45 million people with an urban population of approximately 7million occupying an area of 910,768 square kilometers. These demographics led to development challenges for which major efforts were made to overcome.\n8. Today, we grapple with multiple challenges with a population exceeding 200million occupying the same land mass but 52% residing in urban areas.\n9. Sixty years of nationhood provides an opportunity to ask ourselves questions on the extent to which we have sustained the aspirations of our founding fathers. Where did we do the right things? Are we on course? If not where did we stray and how can we remedy and retrace our steps?\n10. Upon attaining independence, Nigeria’s growth trajectory was anchored on policies and programmes that positively impacted on all sectors of the economy. However, this journey was cut short by the 30-months of civil war.\n11. We came out of the civil war with a focus on reconstruction, rehabilitation and reconciliation that enabled the country to put in place world-class development structures and a strengthened public service that well served the government. This positive trajectory continued with a return to democratic government which was truncated by another round of military rule.\n12. For a cumulative 29 of our 60 years existence as a nation, we have been under military rule.\n13. My summary of our journey so far as a nation is necessary to appropriately chart where we need to go and how to get there TOGETHER.\n14. Today, I am aware that our economy along with every single economy in the world is in crisis. We still face security challenges in parts of the country, while our society suffers from a high loss of moral rectitude which is driven by unbridled craving for political control.\n15. An underlying cause of most of the problems we have faced as a nation is our consistent harping on artificially contrived fault-lines that we have harboured and allowed unnecessarily to fester.\n16. In addition, institutions such as civil service, police, the judiciary, the military all suffered from a general decline.\n17. We need to begin a sincere process of national healing and this anniversary presents a genuine opportunity to eliminate old and outworn perceptions that are always put to test in the lie they always are.\n18. The stereotype of thinking of ourselves as coming from one part of the country before seeing ourselves as Nigerians is a key starting point to project us on the road to our deserved nation’s evolution and integration.\n19. To start this healing process, we are already blessed with the most important asset any nation requires for such – OUR PEOPLE – and this has manifested globally in the exploits of Nigerians in many fields.\n20. It has been demonstrated time and time again that Nigerians in the diaspora frequently excel in science, technology, medicine, sports, arts and many other fields.\n21. Similarly, the creativity, ingenuity and resourcefulness of the Nigerian at home have resulted in globally recognized endeavours.\n22. I am convinced that if we pursue our aspirations TOGETHER we would be able to achieve whatever we desire. That informed our adopting the theme TOGETHER to mark this epochal event.\n23. Together we can change our condition for the better and more importantly, together we can do much more for ourselves and for our country.\n24. I chose the path of self-reflection because this is what I do on a daily basis and I must confess that at most times, I always felt the need for a collective reflection as I know that the foundation for a solid future which this administration is laying can only be sustainable if there is a collective commitment by Nigerians.\n25. Nigeria is not a country for Mr. President, any ruling or opposition party but a country for all of us and we must play our part, irrespective of challenges we face, to make this country what we desire.\n26. To achieve this, we must focus our minds, TOGETHER as a people, on ways of resolving the identified critical challenges that underlie our present state. These include:\na. Evolving and sustaining a democratic culture that leaves power in the hands of the people;\nb. Supporting the enthronement of the rule of law, demanding accountability of elected representatives and contributing to good governance;\nc. Increasing our commitment to peaceful co-existence in a peaceful, secure and united Nigeria;\nd. Harnessing and Optimizing our tremendous human and natural resources to attain our goal of being in the top twenty economies of the world and in the process;\ne. Lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years;\nf. Strengthening institutions to make them stronger in protecting National Interests; and\ng. Imbibing tolerance in diversity.\n27. I am a firm believer in transparent, free, fair and credible elections as has been demonstrated during my period as a democratically elected President.\n28. The recent build-up and eventual outcome of the Edo State elections should encourage Nigerians that it is my commitment to bequeath to this country processes and procedures that would guarantee that the people’s votes count.\n29. The problems with our electoral process are mainly human induced as desperate desire for power leads to desperate attempts to gain power and office.\n30. Democracy, the world over and as I am pursuing in Nigeria, recognizes the power of the people. However, if some constituencies choose to bargain off their power, they should be prepared for denial of their rights.\n31. This call is made more urgent if we realise that even after a transparent, free, fair and credible election, desperation leads to compromising the judiciary to upturn legitimate decisions of the people.\n32. It is necessary to, therefore support the enthronement of the rule of law by avoiding actions which compromise the judiciary.\n33. Fellow Nigerians, our history has shown that we are a people that have the capacity to live peacefully with one another.\n34. As a government, we remain committed to our constitutional oath of securing the lives and properties of the citizenry. I, however, call on the citizenry to also support government by providing the necessary community level intelligence in addressing these challenges.\n35. In moving forward together, it is important to strengthen our economy to provide sustainable means of livelihood for as many Nigerians as possible so as to eradicate absolute poverty from our midst.\n36. I want to re-emphasize my dedication and commitment, a dedication and commitment that propelled my public service career and informed my quest to continually seek for an opportunity to improve the lives of Nigerians, set the country on the path of prosperity and lead the country to a better future.\n37. This administration has been focused on rebuilding and laying the foundations for a sustainable Nigeria. Of course, we have met and are still meeting the challenges inherent in any rebuilding initiative – more so that of a nation like Nigeria that has undergone avoidable levels of deprivation – but can be surmounted if we all work together.\n38. I wish to re-iterate that our people and our spirit of excellence remains our most important asset.\n39. In this wise, the need to return to our age-old ethical and high moral values would be necessary and this informed my launching of the National Ethics and Integrity Policy on Monday 28th September, 2020.\n40. The policy would not implement itself and the first contact of the visibility of its implementation is the Public Service whose on-going reforms would be expected to be sustainable and give a radical re-direction in providing services to all Nigerians.\n41. Fellow Nigerians, in addition to public health challenges of working to contain the spread of the Coronavirus, we have suffered a significant drop in our foreign exchange earnings and internal revenues due to 40 per cent drop in oil prices and steep drop in economic activities, leading to a 60 per cent drop in government revenue.\n42. Our government is grappling with the dual challenge of saving lives and livelihoods in face of drastically reduced resources.\n43. In this regard, sustaining the level of petroleum prices is no longer possible. The government, since coming into office has recognized the economic argument for adjusting the price of petroleum. But the social argument about the knock-on effect of any adjustment weighed heavily with the government.\n44. Accordingly, in the last three years, we have introduced unprecedented measures in support of the economy and to the weakest members of our society in the shape of:\na. Tradermoni\nb. Farmermoni\nc. School Feeding Programme\nd. Job creation efforts\ne. Agricultural intervention programmes\n45. No government in the past did what we are doing with such scarce resources. We have managed to keep things going in spite of the disproportionate spending on security. Those in the previous Governments from 1999 – 2015 who presided over the near destruction of the country have now the impudence to attempt to criticize our efforts.\n46. In the circumstances, a responsible government must face realities and take tough decisions.\n47. Petroleum prices in Nigeria are to be adjusted. We sell now at N161 per litre. A comparison with our neighbours will illustrate the point;\na. Chad which is an oil producing country charges N362 per litre\nb. Niger, also an oil producing country sells 1 litre at N346.\nc. In Ghana, another oil producing country, petroleum pump price is N326 per litre.\n48. Further afield, Egypt charges N211 per litre. Saudi Arabia charges N168 per litre. It makes no sense for oil to be cheaper in Nigeria than in Saudi Arabia.\n49. Fellow Nigerians, to achieve the great country we desire, we need to solidify our strength, increase our commitment and encourage ourselves to do that which is right and proper even when no one is watching.\n50. Fellow Nigerians, let us collectively resolve to continue our journey beyond the sixty years on the clear understanding that as a nation we are greater together than being smaller units of nationalities. By the special grace of God we shall come through any transient challenges.\n51. It is my sincere hope that by the end of this anniversary on September 30th 2021, we will all be proud of taking this individual and collective self-assessment for the progress of our great Nation.\nLong Live the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\nGod Bless us all.

As President, I wish to renew my appreciation to Nigerians for entrusting me with your hopes and aspirations for a better and greater Nigeria.\n2. Today, it is my unique privilege to re-commit myself to the service of this great country of great people with profound diversities and opportunities. We are bound by destiny to be the largest and greatest black nation on earth.\n3. At this stage in our nationhood it is important that we reflect how we got here to enable us work TOGETHER to get to where we aspire to be as a strong indivisible nation, united in hope and equal in opportunity.\n4. On October 1st 1960 when Prime Minister Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa received the constitutional instruments symbolizing Nigeria’s independence, he expressed his wish that having acquired our rightful status as an independent sovereign nation, history would record that the building of our nation proceeded at the wisest pace.\n5. This optimism was anchored on the peaceful planning, full and open consultation and harmonious cooperation with the different groups which culminated in Nigeria emerging as a country without bitterness and bloodshed.\n6. Our founding fathers understood the imperative of structuring a National identity using the power of the state and worked towards unification of Nigerians in a politically stable and viable entity.\n7. That philosophy guided the foundation that was laid for our young nation of 45 million people with an urban population of approximately 7million occupying an area of 910,768 square kilometers. These demographics led to development challenges for which major efforts were made to overcome.\n8. Today, we grapple with multiple challenges with a population exceeding 200million occupying the same land mass but 52% residing in urban areas.\n9. Sixty years of nationhood provides an opportunity to ask ourselves questions on the extent to which we have sustained the aspirations of our founding fathers. Where did we do the right things? Are we on course? If not where did we stray and how can we remedy and retrace our steps?\n10. Upon attaining independence, Nigeria’s growth trajectory was anchored on policies and programmes that positively impacted on all sectors of the economy. However, this journey was cut short by the 30-months of civil war.\n11. We came out of the civil war with a focus on reconstruction, rehabilitation and reconciliation that enabled the country to put in place world-class development structures and a strengthened public service that well served the government. This positive trajectory continued with a return to democratic government which was truncated by another round of military rule.\n12. For a cumulative 29 of our 60 years existence as a nation, we have been under military rule.\n13. My summary of our journey so far as a nation is necessary to appropriately chart where we need to go and how to get there TOGETHER.\n14. Today, I am aware that our economy along with every single economy in the world is in crisis. We still face security challenges in parts of the country, while our society suffers from a high loss of moral rectitude which is driven by unbridled craving for political control.\n15. An underlying cause of most of the problems we have faced as a nation is our consistent harping on artificially contrived fault-lines that we have harboured and allowed unnecessarily to fester.\n16. In addition, institutions such as civil service, police, the judiciary, the military all suffered from a general decline.\n17. We need to begin a sincere process of national healing and this anniversary presents a genuine opportunity to eliminate old and outworn perceptions that are always put to test in the lie they always are.\n18. The stereotype of thinking of ourselves as coming from one part of the country before seeing ourselves as Nigerians is a key starting point to project us on the road to our deserved nation’s evolution and integration.\n19. To start this healing process, we are already blessed with the most important asset any nation requires for such – OUR PEOPLE – and this has manifested globally in the exploits of Nigerians in many fields.\n20. It has been demonstrated time and time again that Nigerians in the diaspora frequently excel in science, technology, medicine, sports, arts and many other fields.\n21. Similarly, the creativity, ingenuity and resourcefulness of the Nigerian at home have resulted in globally recognized endeavours.\n22. I am convinced that if we pursue our aspirations TOGETHER we would be able to achieve whatever we desire. That informed our adopting the theme TOGETHER to mark this epochal event.\n23. Together we can change our condition for the better and more importantly, together we can do much more for ourselves and for our country.\n24. I chose the path of self-reflection because this is what I do on a daily basis and I must confess that at most times, I always felt the need for a collective reflection as I know that the foundation for a solid future which this administration is laying can only be sustainable if there is a collective commitment by Nigerians.\n25. Nigeria is not a country for Mr. President, any ruling or opposition party but a country for all of us and we must play our part, irrespective of challenges we face, to make this country what we desire.\n26. To achieve this, we must focus our minds, TOGETHER as a people, on ways of resolving the identified critical challenges that underlie our present state. These include:\na. Evolving and sustaining a democratic culture that leaves power in the hands of the people;\nb. Supporting the enthronement of the rule of law, demanding accountability of elected representatives and contributing to good governance;\nc. Increasing our commitment to peaceful co-existence in a peaceful, secure and united Nigeria;\nd. Harnessing and Optimizing our tremendous human and natural resources to attain our goal of being in the top twenty economies of the world and in the process;\ne. Lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years;\nf. Strengthening institutions to make them stronger in protecting National Interests; and\ng. Imbibing tolerance in diversity.\n27. I am a firm believer in transparent, free, fair and credible elections as has been demonstrated during my period as a democratically elected President.\n28. The recent build-up and eventual outcome of the Edo State elections should encourage Nigerians that it is my commitment to bequeath to this country processes and procedures that would guarantee that the people’s votes count.\n29. The problems with our electoral process are mainly human induced as desperate desire for power leads to desperate attempts to gain power and office.\n30. Democracy, the world over and as I am pursuing in Nigeria, recognizes the power of the people. However, if some constituencies choose to bargain off their power, they should be prepared for denial of their rights.\n31. This call is made more urgent if we realise that even after a transparent, free, fair and credible election, desperation leads to compromising the judiciary to upturn legitimate decisions of the people.\n32. It is necessary to, therefore support the enthronement of the rule of law by avoiding actions which compromise the judiciary.\n33. Fellow Nigerians, our history has shown that we are a people that have the capacity to live peacefully with one another.\n34. As a government, we remain committed to our constitutional oath of securing the lives and properties of the citizenry. I, however, call on the citizenry to also support government by providing the necessary community level intelligence in addressing these challenges.\n35. In moving forward together, it is important to strengthen our economy to provide sustainable means of livelihood for as many Nigerians as possible so as to eradicate absolute poverty from our midst.\n36. I want to re-emphasize my dedication and commitment, a dedication and commitment that propelled my public service career and informed my quest to continually seek for an opportunity to improve the lives of Nigerians, set the country on the path of prosperity and lead the country to a better future.\n37. This administration has been focused on rebuilding and laying the foundations for a sustainable Nigeria. Of course, we have met and are still meeting the challenges inherent in any rebuilding initiative – more so that of a nation like Nigeria that has undergone avoidable levels of deprivation – but can be surmounted if we all work together.\n38. I wish to re-iterate that our people and our spirit of excellence remains our most important asset.\n39. In this wise, the need to return to our age-old ethical and high moral values would be necessary and this informed my launching of the National Ethics and Integrity Policy on Monday 28th September, 2020.\n40. The policy would not implement itself and the first contact of the visibility of its implementation is the Public Service whose on-going reforms would be expected to be sustainable and give a radical re-direction in providing services to all Nigerians.\n41. Fellow Nigerians, in addition to public health challenges of working to contain the spread of the Coronavirus, we have suffered a significant drop in our foreign exchange earnings and internal revenues due to 40 per cent drop in oil prices and steep drop in economic activities, leading to a 60 per cent drop in government revenue.\n42. Our government is grappling with the dual challenge of saving lives and livelihoods in face of drastically reduced resources.\n43. In this regard, sustaining the level of petroleum prices is no longer possible. The government, since coming into office has recognized the economic argument for adjusting the price of petroleum. But the social argument about the knock-on effect of any adjustment weighed heavily with the government.\n44. Accordingly, in the last three years, we have introduced unprecedented measures in support of the economy and to the weakest members of our society in the shape of:\na. Tradermoni\nb. Farmermoni\nc. School Feeding Programme\nd. Job creation efforts\ne. Agricultural intervention programmes\n45. No government in the past did what we are doing with such scarce resources. We have managed to keep things going in spite of the disproportionate spending on security. Those in the previous Governments from 1999 – 2015 who presided over the near destruction of the country have now the impudence to attempt to criticize our efforts.\n46. In the circumstances, a responsible government must face realities and take tough decisions.\n47. Petroleum prices in Nigeria are to be adjusted. We sell now at N161 per litre. A comparison with our neighbours will illustrate the point;\na. Chad which is an oil producing country charges N362 per litre\nb. Niger, also an oil producing country sells 1 litre at N346.\nc. In Ghana, another oil producing country, petroleum pump price is N326 per litre.\n48. Further afield, Egypt charges N211 per litre. Saudi Arabia charges N168 per litre. It makes no sense for oil to be cheaper in Nigeria than in Saudi Arabia.\n49. Fellow Nigerians, to achieve the great country we desire, we need to solidify our strength, increase our commitment and encourage ourselves to do that which is right and proper even when no one is watching.\n50. Fellow Nigerians, let us collectively resolve to continue our journey beyond the sixty years on the clear understanding that as a nation we are greater together than being smaller units of nationalities. By the special grace of God we shall come through any transient challenges.\n51. It is my sincere hope that by the end of this anniversary on September 30th 2021, we will all be proud of taking this individual and collective self-assessment for the progress of our great Nation.\nLong Live the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\nGod Bless us all.

Gracias al Programa, se logró expandir la cobertura de atención básica y de salud de los brasileños; se amplió el acceso y la oferta de acciones de salud; y se mejoraron los indicadores de salud de la población, reduciéndose las hospitalizaciones por la labor preventiva de los médicos.\nEl nivel de satisfacción y aprobación de los pacientes, médicos y gestores del Programa fue alto. Según un estudio de la Universidad Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG), el 95% de los pacientes estaba satisfecho o muy satisfecho con el Programa.\nSi Cuba no se hubiera visto conminada a retirar sus médicos de Brasil, estos habrían podido contribuir al control y enfrentamiento de la pandemia de la COVID-19 en ese país, el segundo más afectado a nivel mundial.\nCuba es electa para el Comité Ejecutivo de la OPS y denuncia fondo de EE.UU. para denigrar nuestra cooperación médica. El ejemplo de nuestros médicos derrota a la mentira y falacia imperial. #SomosCuba #SomosContinuidad https://t.co/72pQ6MFxRP Via @Granma_Digital— Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez (@DiazCanelB) September 30, 2020\nComo informado en Declaración del Ministerio de Salud Pública del 14 de noviembre de 2018, Cuba tomó la decisión de no continuar participando en el Programa “Más Médicos” ante el servilismo del Presidente brasileño Jair Bolsonaro, quien con actitud despectiva y amenazante hacia nuestros colaboradores y en franco irrespeto a la OPS y a lo convenido por esta con Cuba, impuso modificaciones a los términos del Programa, que condujeron a un incumplimiento de las garantías acordadas inicialmente y a condiciones inaceptables para la permanencia de nuestros profesionales.\nEs repugnante que el gobierno de Estados Unidos intente manipular a los organismos internacionales y regionales a su antojo. Se sabe que no existe documento alguno adoptado por los órganos directivos de la OPS que otorgue un mandato o avale desde el punto de vista legal la realización de esta revisión ni la redacción de sus llamados “Términos de Referencia”.\nDicha redacción estuvo a cargo de un grupo compuesto por Estados Unidos, Brasil, la propia Secretaría de la OPS y Canadá, este último actuando como mediador entre las partes. Para colmo de las arbitrariedades, todo este proceso de revisión se realiza con cargo al Presupuesto ordinario de la OPS.\nSin mandato alguno, se contrató a una firma de abogados estadounidense que en 180 días debe emitir una evaluación ajustada y, por tanto, predeterminada conforme a los “Términos de Referencia” que el selecto grupo dirigido por Estados Unidos ya definió.\nNadie con un sentido básico de honestidad, con un conocimiento de los propósitos y de la conducta del gobierno de Estados Unidos, o con un mínimo de sentido común puede dudar de que se está ante un ataque frontal contra el multilateralismo, de una burda manipulación con fines políticos de la OPS y de una extensión de la agresión contra Cuba.\nTras la denuncia de esta maniobra por el Ministro de Salud Pública José Ángel Portal Miranda en el 58 Consejo Directivo de la OPS, el 28 de septiembre, se demostró en las intervenciones de representantes del Departamento de Estado que el gobierno de Estados Unidos está detrás de las presiones contra la Organización, contra los programas de cooperación de Cuba con Estados miembros de la región y de la llamada “revisión externa” al Programa Más Médicos para Brasil.\nEstados Unidos fue más lejos al oponerse a la elección de Cuba como miembro del Comité Ejecutivo de la OPS, acción que fracasó ante el respaldo unánime que recibió la candidatura de Cuba. Durante las sesiones del Consejo, varios países reconocieron y agradecieron la solidaridad y la cooperación del personal cubano de la salud en el enfrentamiento a la COVID-19.\nEl Ministerio denuncia que se prepara una evaluación espuria y mendaz promovida por y para los propósitos agresivos de Estados Unidos en su afán por desacreditar la cooperación internacional de Cuba.\nResulta lamentable que mediante esta nueva maniobra, el gobierno de Estados Unidos intente dañar las relaciones de Cuba con la OPS, que han descansado históricamente en la cooperación, el respeto, la identificación común de metas y valores humanistas y el empeño en garantizar servicios de salud de calidad a la población. Sobre esas premisas, se ha construido una relación de la que Cuba se ha sentido orgullosa.\nEl Ministerio ratifica el firme compromiso de Cuba con el desarrollo y sostenibilidad de su sistema de salud para beneficio del pueblo cubano y de la cooperación con los pueblos de la región y de otras partes del mundo.\nCuenta con la capacidad para hacerlo, construida con esfuerzos propios. Es una realidad que nadie puede cambiar.\nEl acceso a la salud es un derecho humano y Estados Unidos comete un crimen cuando se propone privar a millones de personas de ese derecho inalienable.\nConforme se expresó en la declaración del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores del 5 de diciembre de 2019, es inmoral e inaceptable que se cuestione la dignidad, la profesionalidad y el altruismo de los más de 400 mil colaboradores cubanos de la salud que, en 56 años, han cumplido misiones en 164 naciones.\nEl recrudecido bloqueo económico, comercial y financiero impuesto por Estados Unidos a Cuba, cuyos efectos son particularmente devastadores en el contexto de la pandemia de la COVID-19, no ha podido ni podrá impedir que nuestro país comparta sus escasos recursos con otros pueblos del mundo que lo necesitan.\nAdemás de enfrentar la pandemia en Cuba, y guiado por la vocación solidaria y humanista de nuestro pueblo, el país ha reforzado su cooperación médica internacional con el envío de más de 3 mil 800 colaboradores organizados en 52 brigadas médicas a 39 países y territorios afectados por la enfermedad, quienes se sumaron a los que ya prestaban servicios en 59 Estados antes de la pandemia.\nComo expresó el líder histórico de la Revolución Cubana, Fidel Castro Ruz, en su reflexión del 2 de octubre de 2014, titulada La hora del deber, “el personal médico que marcha a cualquier punto para salvar vidas, aun a riesgo de perder la suya, es el mayor ejemplo de solidaridad que puede ofrecer el ser humano”.\nLa Habana, 30 de septiembre de 2020\nEDUARDO dijo:\n1\n30 de septiembre de 2020\n13:09:40\nRAFAEL CORONA PEREZ dijo:\n2\n30 de septiembre de 2020\n14:29:12"}, {"claim": "President Joe Biden is abusing the prescription drug Adderall.", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Not Enough Evidence", "justification": "There's no evidence that Biden does or does not take Adderall.", "claim_date": "29-9-2020", "speaker": "Donald Trump", "original_claim_url": "https://slate.com/technology/2020/09/joe-biden-drug-test-trump-adderall-debunk.html", "fact_checking_article": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210307115552/https://misbar.com/en/factcheck/2020/09/30/commotion-accusations-of-adderall-abuse", "reporting_source": "Slate", "location_ISO_code": "US", "claim_types": ["Event/Property Claim"], "fact_checking_strategies": ["Written Evidence", "Consultation"], "questions": [{"question": "What is Adderall?", "answers": [{"answer": "Adderall is an addictive prescription Stimulant with effects similar to Meth.

Only drugs could explain why “Sleepy Joe Biden” sometimes wasn’t so sleepy at all, Trump alleged. If it initially sounded like the president may have been referring to another drug that was famously popular in his heyday in 1980s New York, a surrogate, Rudy Giuliani, clarified things on Fox & Friends on Tuesday morning. He claimed that Biden “has dementia. There’s no doubt about it. I’ve talked to doctors”—and then added: “The president’s quite right to say maybe [Biden]’s taken Adderall.”\nThere’s no evidence to suggest Biden is actually on any drugs, legal or otherwise. But purely hypothetically: Would Adderall really do what Giuliani (and by implication, Trump) claims? What kind of miracle drugs does Trump think Biden would need here? Slate spoke to Michael T. Swanoski, a professor at the University of Minnesota’s College of Pharmacy, to get into what is and isn’t scientifically possible. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\nHeather Schwedel: How would a drug like Adderall affect someone’s debate performances?\nMichael T. Swanoski: Adderall is a stimulant that’s often prescribed for attention deficit disorder. So Adderall potentially could increase your attentiveness if you’re feeling drowsy or if you’re fatigued. But it doesn’t increase cognition per se. It doesn’t improve thinking, but it provides a boost similar to what you’d get from a cup of coffee—a little more pronounced, but not increasing cognition in any way. It wouldn’t have an effect on your acetylcholine, which is the chemical that’s connected with clear thoughts, thinking through a difficult task, and high-level thinking.\nWhat other kind of drugs would take a person from sleepy to wide awake, so to speak?\nThere’s been a push in marketing nutritional supplements that are touted for improving brain health or memory. They make vague claims of brain enhancer or memory enhancer without really getting too specific, because they’re not allowed to make claims that they can’t back up. But there’ve certainly been cases of students using stimulants to help, maybe if they’ve got a big exam, to make them more alert potentially. People are purchasing these products with the hope that they’ll help them with giving them a competitive edge, perhaps in their job or whatever they need to think about.\nWould those show up in a drug test?\nWhether a nutritional supplement would show up in the urine is questionable. If you had amphetamine in your urine, that would show up.\nTrump seems to be implying that there’s a drug that could magically make someone who was frail and confused into a brilliant debater. Is that possible?\nInherently your talents in debating are not going to suddenly be enhanced because you took a nutritional supplement or you took a prescription stimulant. The best they can do is maybe make you more alert. They’re not going to suddenly increase your intelligence. That’s just not possible.\nTrump has been pretty vague, but on Fox News, Rudy Giuliani has gone so far as to say Biden has dementia. There’s a difference between normal cognitive decline and actual dementia, right?\nThere is a difference. As we age, our mental acuity or intelligence, they’re all still there. Forgetting someone’s name is not unusual, but if you forget where you live or where you’re going, it’s really a more pronounced loss of memory and cognitive function. With normal aging, there’s occasional short-term memory lapses here and there, but it’s not profound enough to really impact us. You look at someone like Judge [Ruth Bader] Ginsburg, who was almost 90 years old. She was highly intellectual and exercised her brain, and maybe she had some symptoms of forgetting where she put her keys, but her high level of cognition was still intact. Not everybody who ages gets dementia.\nGiuliani also said “the president’s quite right to say maybe [Biden has] taken Adderall,” implying it would be a treatment for his supposed “sleepiness.”\nDementia is not lack of energy; there’s damage going on in the brain. There’s neural damage that occurs that then impairs the function of these neural transmitters, these chemicals like acetylcholine, which is this chemical that’s really responsible in large part for our normal cognitive function. And so someone with dementia would not be treated with amphetamines to get them more alert. It wouldn’t increase their brain acuity at all. It would make them jittery, more confused, really, because they wouldn’t be able to think clearly. Drugs for dementia are primarily aimed at increasing levels of acetylcholine, like Donepezil, which is used for Alzheimer’s dementia.\nSo just to be clear, you’re saying that Adderall is not a treatment for dementia?\nYou are correct."}, {"claim": "Claims that there were links between Trumps 2016 election campaign and Russia were part of a hoax that Hilary Clinton was behind.", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Refuted", "justification": "This claim is refuted.

Read the full transcript of his remarks here.\nTranscribe Your Own Content\nTry Rev and save time transcribing, captioning, and subtitling.\nJoe Biden: (00:00)\nI had the honor of paying respects to Justice Ginsburg and her family. First woman, first woman in history of our nation to lie in state in the US Capitol. And though it should not have taken nearly this long to bestow that honor on a woman, it nevertheless speaks to the unique and powerful impact Justice Ginsburg has made in our society and her enduring legacy of equal rights and equal justice under the law.\nJoe Biden: (00:36)\nShortly before Justice Ginsburg passed, she told her granddaughter, and I quote, “My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.” End of quote. It wasn’t a personal request. It wasn’t a favor being asked for. It was the last act of a long, unflinching career of standing up for American democracy. Never before in our nation’s history has a Supreme Court justice been nominated and installed while a presidential election is already underway. It defies every precedent, every expectation of a nation where the people, the people, are sovereign and the rule of law reigns.\nJoe Biden: (01:29)\nBut yesterday, before justice Ginsburg could be laid to rest and after a hundred thousands of Americans had already cast their ballots, the president nominated a successor to her seat. It’s no mystery about what’s happening here. President Trump is trying to throw out the Affordable Care Act. He’s been trying to do it for the last four years. The Republican party has been trying to eliminate it for a decade. Twice, already, the Supreme Court has upheld that law, the Affordable Care Act. And the Congress, expressing the popular will of the American people, has rejected President Trump’s efforts, as well.\nJoe Biden: (02:17)\nNow, all of a sudden, this administration believes they found a loophole in the tragedy of Justice Ginsburg’s death. It doesn’t matter to them the Republicans set the precedent just four years ago, when they denied even the courtesy of a hearing to President Obama’s nominee after Justice Scalia passed, after he had only passed away nine the months prior to election day. Didn’t matter to them that millions of Americans already voting on a new president and a new Congress had begun.\nJoe Biden: (02:56)\nAll that does matter is that they see an opportunity to overturn the Affordable Care Act on their way out the door. And as I speak, we are still in the midst of the worst global health crisis in a century, a crisis that has already taken over 200,000 lives, between 750 and 1,000 lives a day and counting. And yet, the Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court right now, as I speak, to eliminate the entire Affordable Care Act. The administration filed a brief in the Supreme Court that concludes, and I quote, “The entire ACA, thus, must fall. The entire ACA, thus, must fall.”\nJoe Biden: (03:51)\nPresident Trump can claim all he wants that he’s going to protect people with pre-existing conditions. But the fact is he’s already fighting to take those protections away as we speak. If he has his way, more than 100 million people with pre-existing conditions like asthma, diabetes, and cancer could once again be denied coverage. Complications from COVID-19 like lung scarring and heart damage could become the next flood of pre-existing conditions used as an excuse to deny coverage to millions of people. Women could once again be charged higher premiums just because they are women. Pregnancy becoming a pre-existing condition, again. Seniors would see their prescription drug prices go up and the funding for Medicare go down.\nJoe Biden: (04:48)\nIt doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter what the American people want. President Trump sees a chance to fulfill his explicit mission: steal away the vital protections of the ACA from countless families who’ve come to rely on them for their health, their financial security, and the lives of those they love. President Trump just tweeted an hour ago, on my way here, and I quote, “Obamacare will be replaced with a much better and far cheaper alternative. If it is terminated in the Supreme Court, it would be a big win for the USA.” Should come as no surprise.\nJoe Biden: (05:36)\nAnd then, Saturday, President Trump would nominate Judge Amy Coney Barrett and, on Sunday, lay out clearly what his objective is: to terminate Obamacare. The judge has a written track record, a written track record of disagreeing adamantly with the Supreme Court’s decisions on two occasions upholding the ACA. In fact, not as a judge, but prior to going on the bench, she publicly criticized Chief Justice Roberts’ opinion upholding the law eight years ago.\nJoe Biden: (06:17)\nThe American people understand the urgency of this moment. They’re already voting in droves because they know their healthcare hangs in the balance. They understand that, if Donald Trump gets his way, they could lose their right to vote, their right to clean air and water, their right to equal pay for equal work. Workers could lose their collective bargaining rights. Dreamers could be thrown out of the only country they’ve ever known. And women could lose the bedrock rights enshrined in Roe v. Wade for 50 years. People are voting right now because they know the very soul of this country is at stake and because they know that the decisions of the Supreme Court affect their everyday lives.\nJoe Biden: (07:03)\nTheir voices may not matter to Donald Trump. They may not matter to Mitch McConnell. But there are Senate Republicans out there who know, in their hearts, that if they shut out the voices of those during a voting period, during an election, they’re closing the door on American democracy thereafter. This is where the power of the nation resides, in the people, in the rule of law, in precedents we abide by. To subvert both, openly and needlessly, even as Americans cast their vote, would be an irreversible step toward the brink and a betrayal of a single quality that America has borne and built on. The people decide.\nJoe Biden: (07:56)\nThe Senate has to stand strong for our democracy. They must not act on this nomination until the American people finish the process they’re already begun, of selecting their president and their Congress. And I’ve said before, if the people choose Donald Trump, then the Senate should give his nominee a hearing and a vote. If the people do not choose Trump and choose me, President Trump’s nomination should be withdrawn. I should nominate… chosen by a president who’s just been elected by the people… to get a fair hearing, which would not even occur until early February… a confirmation vote.\nJoe Biden: (08:43)\nThe US Constitution provides one chance, one, for the Americans to have their voices heard on who serves a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court, who makes those big decisions about their healthcare, their civil rights, and much else. That chance is now. That moment is now. And the voters, in my view, are not going to stand for this abuse of power. And, if we’re to call ourselves a democracy, their voices must be heard.\nJoe Biden: (09:17)\nI urge the American people to keep voting and to let your current senators know that you want to be heard before a vote on confirmation of a new justice. And I urge every senator to take a step back from the brink, take off the blinders on politics for just one critical moment, and stand up for the Constitution you swore to uphold. This is a time to de-escalate, to put an end to the shattering of precedents that has thrown our nation into chaos under this president.\nJoe Biden: (09:55)\nJust because you have the power to do something doesn’t absolve you of your responsibility to do right by the American people. Uphold your Constitutional duty. Summon your conscience. Stand up for the people. Stand up for our cherished system of checks and balances. Americans are watching. Americans are voting. We must listen to them now. We must allow them to exercise this sacred power. So please listen. Thank you, and God bless America. May God protect our troops. And I’ll take a few questions. Yes, sir.\nSpeaker 2: (10:38)\nSir, we’ve already [inaudible 00:10:41] seats to the US Supreme Court. But what should be the consequences for Republicans if they force Judge Barrett’s nomination through and confirm her?\nJoe Biden: (10:49)\nThey should see to it that the American public will vote on the Senate races in this election, and they’ll vote Republicans out of office. That’s the consequence. That’s the focus. That’s why I want to make it clear and stay on message here. The clear focus is this is about your healthcare. This is about whether or not the ACA will exist. This is about whether or not pre-existing conditions will continue to be covered. This is about whether or not a woman can be charged more for the same procedure as a man. This is about people’s healthcare in the middle of a pandemic. Yes?\nSpeaker 3: (11:31)\n[inaudible 00:11:32]-\nJoe Biden: (11:36)\nYou can ask me one question. Fire away.\nSpeaker 3: (11:37)\nHave you reached out to Senate Republicans that you’ve worked with to urge them not to vote? Have you had any contact with any Republicans [inaudible 00:11:41]?\nJoe Biden: (11:44)\nNo, I have not. I concluded that that would put them in a position, if they were to vote the right way, that they’d be compromised because I called them. But I know I have great respect for a number of my Republican colleagues, my former Republican colleagues. And I’m hoping they will do the right thing.\nSpeaker 3: (12:05)\n[inaudible 00:12:01]?\nJoe Biden: (12:10)\nHe’s almost… No, I have no comment. Yes?\nSpeaker 4: (12:28)\nThe President’s clear on the question of expanding the Supreme Court in the event that his nominee does get on the Court. Have you ruled out expanding the Supreme Court as president, under any circumstances whatsoever?\nJoe Biden: (12:32)\nI am not… And I know you’re going to be upset with my answer. But what I’m not going to do is play the Trump game, which is a good game he plays. Take your eye off the issue before us. If I were to say yes or no to that, that becomes a big issue. That’s the headline here. I am focused on one thing right now, and I really mean it. I’m focused on making sure the American people understand that they’re being cut out of this process they’re entitled to be part, and the cutout is designed in order to take away the ACA and your health care in the midst of a pandemic. That’s the focus. That’s what it’s on. And that’s the deal. Thank you all so very, very much. Thank you.\nSpeaker 5: (13:20)\nThank you all and take care.\nJoe Biden: (13:30)\nDid you have a question, sir? I’m sorry.\nSpeaker 6: (13:30)\n[inaudible 00:13:25]? What do you feel like you have to accomplish to be successful on Tuesday? What do you have to do to win this thing?\nJoe Biden: (13:34)\nJust tell the truth. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: (13:36)\nThank you, guys. [inaudible 00:13:38].\nJoe Biden: (13:36)\nThank you very much."}, {"claim": "Raveer Singh requested Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) to let him join anxiety-prone Actor Deepika Padukone during drug interrogation.", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Refuted", "justification": "From the Q&As is obvious that this did not happen as it has been denied by the NCB.

Padukone, who was shooting for Shakun Batra’s film with Ananya Panday and Siddhant Chaturvedi in Goa, was accompanied by actor-husband Ranveer Singh. Republic Media Network sources have now informed that in a big move, Ranveer Singh has asked the central anti-drug agency whether he can be present during his wife’s questioning on Saturday.\nIn his application to the NCB, Ranveer Singh has stated that Deepika Padukone sometimes suffers from anxiety and gets panic attacks, and hence he should be granted permission to be with her, top sources said. The actor has stated that he is a 'law-abiding citizen' and knows that he cannot be present at the time of Deepika Padukone's questioning but is understood to have requested that he be allowed inside the NCB office, sources confirmed.\nHowever, no decision has been taken by the NCB on his application, sources added. Deepika Padukone is set to appear before the NCB on September 26, along with Sara Ali Khan and Shraddha Kapoor. Actor Rakul Preet Singh and Deepika Padukone's manager Karishma Prakash are summoned on Friday. Meanwhile, statements of fashion designer Simone Khambatta and Shruti Modi, Rajput's former manager, were recorded by the NCB probe team in connection with the drugs case.\nThe NCB on Thursday asked Dharma Productions' executive producer Kshitij Ravi to appear before it in the drugs probe linked to Sushant Singh Rajput's death. Dharma Productions is owned by film-maker Karan Johar. Ravi has been asked to appear on Friday as his name surfaced during the probe. So far, the NCB has arrested actor Rhea Chakraborty in the case among others.\nRepublic Media Network sources had earlier reported that six top male Bollywood actors have called their lawyers, fearful of action being taken against them over NCB's massive crackdown on the drug nexus in Bollywood. Sources have told that several stars are doing all they can to plan an escape route. Sources have informed that other talent management agencies have hit the panic button after KWAN came under NCB scanner.\nREAD | When Ranveer Singh & Diljit sported the same red Louis Vuitton hoodie; Who wore it better?\nREAD | Sushant case & drug probe LIVE Updates: Ranveer Singh wants to accompany Deepika to NCB\nThere are at least two angles running in tandem in terms of the NCB's investigation into the link between Bollywood and drugs - regarding the Sushant Singh Rajput-Rhea Chakraborty and associated angle and regarding Manjinder Singh Sirsa's complaint about a 2019 Bollywood party video that had emerged earlier in which a lot of Bollywood stars were present. The video in question had been shared by Karan Johar and had taken place at his house. The NCB has transferred the complaint to Mumbai and is verifying the video. The summons to stars like Deepika Padukone, Sara Ali Khan, Shraddha Kapoor, Rakul Preet Singh and Simone Khambatta, however, are part of two FIRs that are both related to the Sushant Singh Rajput death case drug probe.\nREAD | Ranveer Singh & Rohit Shetty to reunite for another movie after 'Simmba': Reports\nREAD | India's deaf community thanks Ranveer Singh; say, \"With your support we felt inspired\""}, {"claim": "False Facebook posts claim Philippine vice president demanded multi-billion dollar budget for her office in 2021", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Refuted", "justification": "The answer and source refute the claim as the billion dollar budget was not demanded.", "claim_date": "24-9-2020", "speaker": "AFP Philippines", "original_claim_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201226100316/https://factcheck.afp.com/afp-philippines", "fact_checking_article": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201226100316/https://factcheck.afp.com/false-facebook-posts-claim-philippine-vice-president-demanded-multi-billion-dollar-budget-her-office", "reporting_source": "Facebook", "location_ISO_code": "PH", "claim_types": ["Causal Claim", "Quote Verification"], "fact_checking_strategies": ["Written Evidence"], "questions": [{"question": "Did the Philippine vice president demand multi-billion dollar budget for her office in 2021?", "answers": [{"answer": "At the live video’s 12-minute 38-second mark, Robredo states: \"We submitted initially a budget of 720 million pesos ($14.8 million), which is the same budget as what we had last year.

Biden accused Trump & the Republicans of “abuse of power” and asked the Senate to wait until after the election. He also said Trump’s nominee should be withdrawn if he wins. Full transcript here.\nTranscribe Your Own Content\nTry Rev and save time transcribing, captioning, and subtitling.\nJoe Biden: (03:43)\nWelcome to the nation’s Constitution Center. I had the great privilege of being a guest here. It’s an appropriate place to make the speech I’m about to make. I attended a mass earlier today and prayed for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and her family. The nation lost a heroine, an icon. They also lost a mother, a grandmother, and a matriarch. We know how hard that is, to watch a piece of your soul absorb the cruelty and the pain of the dreadful disease of cancer. I spoke to her daughter and her granddaughter last night, expressing my whole family, I mean, my whole family’s sorrow, particularly my grown granddaughters, one of whom was a student of Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s daughter at Columbia. They made clear to me, daughter and granddaughter, that until the very end, Justice Ginsburg displayed the character and courage we’d expect of her. They said she held their hands and gave them strength and purpose to carry on.\nJoe Biden: (05:13)\nIt’s been noted that she passed away on Rosh Hashanah. By tradition, a person who dies during the Jewish new year is considered a soul of great righteousness. That was Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a righteous soul. It was my great honor, when I was in the Senate and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to preside over her confirmation hearings and strongly support her ascension to the Supreme Court bench. Justice Ginsburg achieved a standing few justices have or ever will. She became a presence in the lives of so many Americans and a part of our culture.\nJoe Biden: (06:00)\nI agree with what others have said, that she did as much to advance the constitutional rights, opportunities, and justice for women as Justice Marshall did for African Americans. Yes, there was humor and mentions of the Notorious RBG and her impressive exercise routines, but there was so much more. She was, to use an overused word, a trailblazer, a role model, a source of hope and a powerful voice for justice. She was proof, proof that courage and conviction and moral clarity can change not only the law, it can change our culture. It can change the world. And I believe in the days and months and years ahead, excuse me, she will continue to inspire millions of Americans all across this country. And together we can, and we will, continue to be a voice for justice in her name.\nJoe Biden: (07:05)\nHer granddaughter said yesterday and said publicly that her dying words were, “My most fervent wish is that I not be replaced until a new president is installed.” As a nation, we should heed her final call to us, not as a personal service to her, but as a service to the country, our country, at a crossroads. There’s so much at stake, the right to healthcare, clean air, clean water, the environment, equal pay for equal work, the rights of voters, immigrants, women, workers. And right now our country faces a choice, a choice about whether we will come back from the brink.\nJoe Biden: (08:01)\nThat’s what I would like to talk with you about for a few minutes today. Within an hour of news of her passing, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said President Trump’s nominee to replace Justice Ginsburg will receive a vote in the Senate. Within an hour of her passing. The exact opposite of what he said when President Obama nominated Merrick Garland to replace Justice Scalia in 2016. At that time, Majority Leader McConnell made up a rule based on the fiction that I somehow believe there should be no nomination to the court in an election year. That’s ridiculous. The only rule I’ve ever followed relating to the Supreme Court nomination was the Constitution’s obligation for senators to provide their advice and their consent to a president’s judicial nominee.\nJoe Biden: (09:02)\nBut he created a new rule, the McConnell rule. Absolutely no hearing, no vote for a nominee in an election year, period, no caveats, and many Republican senators agreed with him, including then Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, including the current Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, who at the time said, and I quote verbatim, here’s what he said. “I want you to use my words against me if there’s a Republican president in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term. You can say, Lindsey Graham said, let’s let the next president, whoever it might be, make the nomination.” Continuing to quote, “And you could use my words against me, and you’d be absolutely right.” End of quote. That’s what Republicans said when Justice Scalia passed away about nine months before election day that year.\nJoe Biden: (10:18)\nNow, having lost Justice Ginsburg less than seven weeks before the election this year, after Americans have already begun to cast their vote. It’s estimated that up to 40% of Americans will have voted by October 1st, but at least 30%. Tens of millions. And you can’t unring the bell. Having made this their standard when it served their interests, they cannot just four years later change course when it doesn’t serve their ends. Look, I’m not being naive. I’m not speaking to President Trump, who will do whatever he wants. I’m not speaking to Mitch McConnell, who will do what he wants, and he does. I’m speaking to those Republicans out there, Senate Republicans, who know deep down what is right for the country and consistent with the Constitution, as I stand here in the Constitution Center, not just what’s best for their party.\nJoe Biden: (11:30)\nI’m speaking for millions of Americans out there who already have voted and continue to vote, and we’ll have many more voted by the time this process is finished. Millions of Americans who are voting because they know their healthcare hangs in the balance. In the middle of the worst global health crisis in living memory, Donald Trump is before the Supreme Court, trying to strip healthcare coverage away from tens of millions of families. This took away the peace of mind of more than 100 million Americans with preexisting conditions. If he succeeds, insurers could once again discriminate or drop coverage completely for people living with preexisting conditions, like asthma, diabetes, cancer, and so many other problems.\nJoe Biden: (12:28)\nAnd perhaps most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, the complications from COVID-19, which are well beyond what they should be, it’s estimated that 200 million people have died probably by the time I finish this talk, the complications of COVID-19, like lung scarring and heart damage, could become the next deniable preexisting condition for over six million Americans who’ve already contracted the disease.\nJoe Biden: (13:09)\nMillions of Americans are also voting because they don’t want nearly half a century of legal precedent to be overturned and lose the right to choose. Millions of Americans who are at risk of losing their right to vote. Millions of Dreamers who are at risk of being expelled from the only country they have ever known. Millions of workers. Union workers who are at risk of losing their right to collectively bargain. Millions of Americans who are demanding that their voices be heard, that equal justice be a guarantee for all, not just some. They know, we all know, what should happen now. The voters of this country should be heard. As I said, voting has already begun. By the time we get to the middle of October, there will be millions and millions and millions who have already voted. In just a few weeks, all votes in this nation will be heard. They’re the ones who the Constitution envisions should decide who has the power to make this appointment.\nJoe Biden: (14:27)\nThis appointment isn’t about the past. It’s about the future, and the people of this nation, and the people of this nation are choosing their future right now, as they vote. To jam this nomination through the Senate is just an exercise in raw political power, and I don’t believe that the people of this nation will stand for it. President Trump has already made it clear, this is about power, pure and simple power. Whether the voters should make it clear on this issue and so many others, the power in this nation resides with them, the American people, the voters, and even if President Trump wants to put forward a name now, the Senate should not act until after the American people select their next president, their next Congress, their next Senate. If Donald Trump wins the election, then the Senate should move on his selection and weigh the nominee he chooses fairly.\nJoe Biden: (15:39)\nBut if I win this election, President Trump’s nominee should be withdrawn, and as a new president I should be the one who nominates Justice Ginsburg’s successor, a nominee who should get a fair hearing in the Senate before a confirmation hearing, before a confirmation vote, I should say, after a confirmation hearing.\nJoe Biden: (16:05)\nWe’re in the middle of a pandemic. Like I said, as I speak, we’re probably passing 200,000 deaths lost to this virus. Tens of millions of Americans are unemployed. Healthcare in this country hangs in the balance before the court. And now, in a raw political move, this president and the Republican leader have decided to jam a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court through the United States Senate. That’s the last thing we need at this moment. As I said, voters have already begun casting their votes in the millions. And in just a few weeks, we’re going to know who the voters of this nation have chosen as the next president. The United States Constitution was designed to give voters one chance, one chance to have their voice heard in who serves on the court. And by the way, there’s no court session between now and the end of this election.\nJoe Biden: (17:12)\nThat moment is now for the voters to get a chance to be heard, and their voice should be heard. And I believe voters are going to make it clear. They’ll not stand for this abuse of power, this constitutional abuse. There’s no discussion about what happens if the Senate confirms on the eve of election or in a lame duck after Donald Trump loses. A successor to Justice Ginsburg, what happens? But that discussion assumes that we lose this effort to prevent the grave wrong that Trump and McConnell are pursuing here. I’m not going to assume failure at this point. I believe the voices of the American people should be heard and will be heard. This vote, this fight, this nomination will not be over until the Senate votes, if it does vote. Winning that vote, if it happens, is everything. Action and reaction, anger and more anger, sorrow and frustration at the way things are in this country now politically, that’s the cycle that Republican senators will continue to perpetuate if they go down this dangerous path that they put us on.\nJoe Biden: (18:37)\nWe need to deescalate, not escalate. That’s why I appeal to those few Senate Republicans, the handful who really will decide what happens. Please, follow your conscience. Don’t vote to confirm anyone nominated under the circumstances President Trump and Senator McConnell have created. Don’t go there. Uphold your constitutional duty, your conscience. Let the people speak. Cool the flames that have been engulfing our country. We can’t keep rewriting history, scrambling norms, ignoring our cherished system of checks and balances. That includes this whole business of releasing a list of potential nominees that I would put forward. They’re now saying, after Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away, they said, “Biden should release his list.” It’s no wonder the Trump campaign asked that I release the list only after she passed away. It’s a game for them. It’s a play to [inaudible 00:19:44] up emotions and anger.\nJoe Biden: (19:46)\nThere’s a reason why no presidential candidate, other than Donald Trump, has ever done such a thing. First, putting a judge’s name on a list like that could influence that person’s decision making as a judge, and that would be wrong, or at least create the perception that it would have influence. Second, anyone put on a list like that under these circumstances will be subject to unrelenting political attacks. Because any nominee I would select would not get a hearing until 2021 at the earliest, she would endure those attacks for months on end, without being able to defend herself. Thirdly, and finally, perhaps most importantly, if I win, I’ll make my choice for the Supreme Court not based on a partisan election campaign, but on what prior presidents have done, Republican and Democrats, and I’ve served with many of them.\nJoe Biden: (20:49)\nOnly after consulting Democrats and Republicans in the United States Senate and seeking their advice and asking for the consent, it says, “Advice and consent of the Senate,” the president is the person who gets to name someone, propose. The Senate deposes. As everyone knows, I made it clear that my first choice for the Supreme Court will make history as the first African American woman justice. But I’ll consult with senators in both parties about that pick, as well as the legal and civil leaders in our country. In the end, the choice will be mine and mine alone, but I will consult. It will be the product of a process that restores our finest traditions, not the extension of one that’s torn this country apart the last years.\nJoe Biden: (21:47)\nSo let me conclude with this. As I’ve said in this campaign, we’re in the battle for the soul of this country. We face historic crises, once in a generation pandemic, a devastating economic recession, the rise of white supremacy that the FBI directors warned us against, unseen since the sixties, and a reckoning on race that’s long overdue, a challenging climate, a changing climate that is ravaging our nation and the world as we speak. Supreme Court decisions will touch every part of these crises, every part of our lives and our future. The last thing we need is to add a constitutional crisis that plunges us deeper into the abyss, deeper into the darkness.\nJoe Biden: (22:51)\nIf we go down this path, I predict it will cause irreversible damage. The infection this president has unleashed on our democracy can be fatal. Enough. Enough. Enough. We must come together as a nation. Democrats, Republicans, independents, liberals, conservatives, everybody. I’m not saying we have to agree on everything, but we have to reason our way through what ails us as citizens, voters, public service. That’s the guidebook called the Constitution. We have to act in good faith, in mutual goodwill, in the spirit of conciliation, not confrontation.\nJoe Biden: (23:49)\nThis nation will continue to be inspired by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, but we should not only be inspired by her, we should be guided by her, by her willingness to listen to those with whom she disagreed, to respect other points of view. Famously, Justice Ginsburg got along well with some of the most conservative justices on the court. And she did it without compromising her principles, clouding her moral clarity, or losing her core principles. If she can do this, so can we. How we talk to one another matters, how we treat one another matters, respecting others matters. Justice Ginsburg proved it’s important to have a spine of steel, but also important to have an open hand, not a clenched fist, to those with whom we disagree.\nJoe Biden: (24:54)\nThis nation needs to come together. I’ve said it many times in this election. We are the United States of America. There’s nothing we cannot overcome. There’s nothing we cannot do, if we do it together. Donald Trump seems to want to divide this nation between red states and blue states, between representing those states that vote for him and ignoring those who don’t. I do not. I cannot, I will not be that president. I’ll be a president for the whole country, for those who vote for me and those who vote against me. We need to rise in this moment for the sake of the country we love so dearly, indeed for its very soul. May God bless the United States of America. May God protect our troops. And may God bless Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

The rating on the claim has been changed to Partly False to reflect that reporting.\nIn February 2021, this story has been updated to reflect current information on the origin of the novel coronavirus.\nThe claim: The coronavirus may have originated in a Chinese laboratory.\nAs the new coronavirus spreads, theories about its origins have circulated. And as scientists have studied the virus, some theories have been debunked as false.\nOne of the most prominent initial reports on the virus is an article published in January 2020 by the right-leaning Washington Times that suggests the coronavirus may have originated in a research laboratory in Wuhan, China.\nRelated:WHO says coronavirus came from an animal and was not made in a lab\nMore:Fact check: Coronavirus originated in China, not elsewhere, researchers and studies say\nThe article quoted a former military intelligence officer who claimed the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a maximum-security Chinese laboratory granted authority to research dangerous pathogens, “is linked to Beijing’s covert bio-weapons program.”\nIn mid-March, USA TODAY contacted the author of the article, Bill Gertz, with a request to comment but did not get a response.\nOn March 25, the Washington Times published an updated article that reflects what an editor's note said is updated reporting: \"Since this story ran, scientists outside of China have had a chance to study the SARS-CoV-2 virus. They concluded it does not show signs of having been manufactured or purposefully manipulated in a lab, though the exact origin remains murky and experts debate whether it may have leaked from a Chinese lab that was studying it.\"\nPeople on multiple platforms and networks have shared the same or a similar version of the conspiracy theory.\nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., has suggested to Congress and Fox News that there may be a connection between the Wuhan lab and the origin of the virus. And conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh wrote in an article in February that “it probably is a ChiCom (Chinese Communist) laboratory experiment that is in the process of being weaponized.”\nFormer White House strategist Steve Bannon repeated a similar claim on Fox News in March. And opinion columnist Steven Mosher touted the idea in the New York Post in February.\nVox reported the claim also has been shared widely via message boards in China, prompting Chinese officials to release a statement denouncing the information.\nWhat researchers say: COVID-19 likely originated in nature\nResearchers have been racing to learn about the virus since it was recognized in December 2019 as a new strain. Medical journals have pointed toward animals in nature as the origin of the virus.\nOn April 21, the World Health Organization noted at a briefing that available evidence indicates coronavirus originated in animals in China late last year and was not manipulated or produced in a laboratory as has been alleged.\n\"It is probable, likely, that the virus is of animal origin,\" WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said.\nRichard Ebright, a professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, said earlier this year in an interview with The Washington Post: “Based on the virus genome and properties, there is no indication whatsoever that it was an engineered virus.”\nThe Washington Post reported most countries have abandoned their bioweapons programs after years of work did not yield satisfactory results.\nThe Scripps Research Institute released a study that rejects the notion that the virus was man-made. Researchers concluded that if the virus were engineered, its genome sequence would more closely resemble earlier and more serious versions of the coronavirus.\n“If someone were seeking to engineer a new coronavirus as a pathogen, they would have constructed it from the backbone of a virus known to cause illness,” the report said. “But the scientists found that the SARS-CoV-2 backbone differed substantially from those of already known coronaviruses and mostly resembled related viruses found in bats and pangolins.”\nA statement in the Lancet, a medical journal, written by public health officials who have been following the progression of the virus also asserted that animals are the likely source: “Scientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife.”\nThe statement referenced multiple academic and government sources that supported the Lancet article’s conclusion. These sources include the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; Nature; U.S. National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine; the New England Journal of Medicine; the Chinese Medical Journal; and the medical journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution.\nResearchers who analyzed the genome of the coronavirus found its sequence shared a very high resemblance to a coronavirus in bats, but it's possible other animals may have been involved in the transmission process.\n“2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus,” a study published in the science journal Nature said.\nAnother study published in the Lancet found results based on samples collected from nine patients who had contracted the virus corroborated the theory that the virus had come from bats. Researchers concluded the genome sequences of the coronavirus “was closely related … to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses.”\nAlthough scientists say they believe bats were likely the original host, it’s also very possible, the study notes, that the virus was transferred from a bat to another animal that may have been at the seafood market in Wuhan.\nWhile experts agree the virus came from nature, its origins beyond that remain unclear.\nOne scenario has the virus occurring naturally – from a bat, say – but accidentally escaping the research facility because of poor safety protocols. This is based on circumstantial evidence such as the Wuhan Institute of Virology's history of studying coronaviruses in bats, the lab's proximity to where some of the infections were first diagnosed and China's lax safety record in its labs.\nAnthony Fauci, the U.S.'s top infectious disease expert, was dismissive of the theory of an accidental escape from a Chinese laboratory, USA TODAY reported on April 18.\n\"A group of highly qualified evolutionary virologists looked at the sequences in bats as they evolve. The mutations that it took to get to the point where it is now are totally consistent with a jump of a species from an animal to a human,\" he said Friday in the White House press briefing.\nBut two administration officials with knowledge of the investigation, speaking to USA TODAY on condition of anonymity because it is classified and sensitive, said they have always questioned China's account of how the virus originated and have taken seriously suggestions that it may have resulted from a lab accident that the Chinese are covering up.\n\"There's a high level of suspicion,\" one official said.\nThe officials emphasized that no conclusions have been drawn from an investigation that is ongoing among U.S. intelligence agencies.\nBut even as of Jan. 15, 2021, its origins are unclear, as described in this State Department statement: \"The U.S. government does not know exactly where, when, or how the COVID-19 virus — known as SARS-CoV-2 — was transmitted initially to humans. We have not determined whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan, China.\"\nOur ruling: Partly False\nWe rate the claim that COVID-19 may have originated in a Chinese lab as PARTLY FALSE. Suggestions that the novel coronavirus was engineered for use in bioweapons in a high-security biomedical laboratory in Wuhan, China, were debunked, based on scientific research since the virus began its global spread. Investigations continue into where COVID-19 began, and no conclusions can be drawn, nor has evidence been presented, that definitively explains the pathogen’s origin. Circumstantial evidence suggests the virus could have escaped from the Wuhan lab due to a lapse in safety measures.\nOur fact-check sources:\n- Statement from The Lancet\n- A study published in the science journal Nature\n- Lancet: Genomic characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding\n- Washington Post: Experts debunk fringe theory linking China’s coronavirus to weapons research\n- South China Morning Post: Chinese research lab ‘badly hurt’ by man-made coronavirus rumours\n- NY Post: Don’t buy China’s story: The coronavirus may have leaked from a lab\n- Fox News: Bannon on coronavirus fears impacting global economy\n- Rush Limbaugh\n- Fox News: Tom Cotton on coronavirus origins\n- Sen.

Two of the viral photographs were found from his twitter timeline.\nAccording to a Times of India report, two pilots lost their lives on February 1, 2019, after the Mirage 2000 trainer fighter aircraft of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) crashed at the HAL Airport in Bengaluru. The pilots were identified as Squadron leader Siddharth Negi and Squadron leader Samir Abrol.\nTherefore, the photos show a Mirage 2000 and not a Rafale aircraft, unlike the viral claims.\nIt is noteworthy to mention that initial tweet with the false claim was from a fan account of Shweta Singh. She is the Executive Editor of Special Programming at Aaj Tak.\nThe bio of this account clearly mentions that it isn't her actual account.\nPIB Fact check also debunked the claims.\nTherefore, old photographs from an aeroplane crash at Bengaluru were shared with false claims.\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343.\nAlso Read: Fact Check: Video From Italian Republic Day Shared As Rafale See-Off Hosted By France"}, {"claim": "The rate of abortions under Democratic presidential administrations has actually fallen more precipitously.", "required_reannotation": true, "label": "Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking", "justification": "While the QA pairs do support lower levels of abortion during Democratic administrations , they also state there were fewer pregnancies.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\nWhen Donald Trump ran for President, he promised a “better deal” to constrain Iran’s nuclear program and pledged to pressure Tehran into curbing its aggressive behavior across the Middle East. Like so many of President Trump’s promises, these proved to be just empty words. Instead, he recklessly tossed away a policy that was working to keep America safe and replaced it with one that has worsened the threat.\nThis past month has proven that Trump’s Iran policy is a dangerous failure. At the United Nations, Trump could not rally a single one of America’s closest allies to extend the UN arms embargo on Iran. Next, Trump tried to unilaterally reimpose UN sanctions on Iran, only to have virtually all the UN security council members unite to reject his gambit. Now there are reports that Iran has stockpiled 10 times as much enriched uranium as it had when President Barack Obama and I left office.\nWe urgently need to change course.\nI have no illusions about the challenges the regime in Iran poses to America’s security interests, to our friends and partners and to its own people. But there is a smart way to be tough on Iran, and there is Trump’s way. He ignored our closest allies and walked away – alone, without a plan – from a deal that put the world’s eyes and ears inside Iran’s nuclear program and was verifiably blocking Iran’s pathways to a nuclear weapon.\nHe has repeatedly ratcheted up tensions, risking bringing us closer to another Middle Eastern war without a realistic strategy or endgame. He has lurched into risky escalations that endangered our troops – and then downplayed their brain injuries as “headaches.”\nBy any objective measure, Trump’s “maximum pressure” has been a boon to the regime in Iran and a bust for America’s interests.\nFive years ago, American-led diplomacy produced a deal that ensured it would take Iran at least a year to produce enough fissile material for one bomb. Now – because Trump let Iran off the hook from its obligations under the nuclear deal –Tehran’s “breakout time” is down to just a few months.\nAnd there is no serious diplomacy underway to reverse it. The bottom line is that Iran is closer to a nuclear bomb today than it was when Donald Trump took office. And Trump has no answer for that. Five years ago, even Russia and China stood with our European allies behind an American-led approach to Iran’s nuclear program.\nNow, America stands alone. Trump’s policies have pushed Russia and China closer to Iran, while reducing transatlantic relations to their lowest point in decades. When tensions spiked early this year, instead of rallying to America’s side, our European allies called for “all parties to exercise utmost restraint and responsibility.”\nBecause Trump violated an agreement that America itself negotiated and then acted recklessly, other world powers now devote their energies to opposing US policy instead of working alongside us to counter Tehran. This mix of confrontation and isolation will leave us with the worst of both worlds: no arms embargo or snapback of UN sanctions, but also no deal to constrain Iran’s nuclear program – and no plan except to recklessly double down.\nFive years ago, Iran was a bad regional actor requiring active deterrence and pushback. But it had not conducted a major attack on US forces in the region in years. Since Trump took office, Iran or its proxies have killed two American service members and a US contractor, severely injured more than 100 US troops, damaged Saudi oil facilities and disabled commercial ships transiting the Gulf.\nBefore Trump, years went by without a militia rocket attack on US facilities in Iraq. Now they happen regularly. Instead of restoring deterrence, Trump has emboldened Iran. Instead of ending “endless wars,” Trump has repeatedly brought America to the brink of a new one. If this is what Trump considers success, I would hate to see what failure looks like.\nThe good news is that there remains a better way.\nHere’s what I would do as President.\nFirst, I will make an unshakable commitment to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\nSecond, I will offer Tehran a credible path back to diplomacy. If Iran returns to strict compliance with the nuclear deal, the United States would rejoin the agreement as a starting point for follow-on negotiations. With our allies, we will work to strengthen and extend the nuclear deal’s provisions, while also addressing other issues of concern. This includes working aggressively to free unjustly detained Americans and calling out the regime for its ongoing violations of human rights, including the execution of wrestler Navid Afkari this week and the wrongful detention of political prisoners, such as human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh. And we will work to help our partners reduce tensions and help end regional conflicts, including the disastrous war in Yemen.\nI will also take steps to make sure US sanctions do not hinder Iran’s fight against Covid-19. And on day one, I will repeal Trump’s disgraceful travel ban targeting a number of Muslim-majority countries, among others.\nThird, we will continue to push back against Iran’s destabilizing activities, which threaten our friends and partners in the region. Drawing on the record-setting US-Israel security assistance agreement signed when I was Vice President, America will also work closely with Israel to ensure it can defend itself against Iran and its proxies. We will continue to use targeted sanctions against Iran’s human rights abuses, its support for terrorism and ballistic missile program.\nStay up to date...\nIf Iran chooses confrontation, I am prepared to defend our vital interests and our troops. But, I am ready to walk the path of diplomacy if Iran takes steps to show it is ready too.\nWith the world back at America’s side, a Biden administration will make it a priority to set Iran policy right."}, {"claim": "The UK public won’t be able to claim compensation if unlicensed vaccines damage our health.", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking", "justification": "The evidence presented to support this claim appears to be contradictory, therefore I have judged it as conflicting evidence.

Read the full transcript of thee rally here.\nTranscribe Your Own Content\nTry Rev and save time transcribing, captioning, and subtitling.\nDonald Trump: (02:14)\nWell, I thank you very much. So I want to start by saying, “Hello, Nevada. How are you doing? How are you?” And I’m thrilled to be in Douglas County, but people are coming from all over the place. There’s a lot of people for Douglas County, isn’t it? We have thousands and thousands of loyal, hardworking American patriots, that’s what we have. And 52 days from now, we’re going to win Nevada, and we’re going to win four more years in the White House. And then after that we’ll negotiate, right? ‘Cause we’re probably, based on the way we were treated, we’re probably entitled to another four after that.\nDonald Trump: (03:15)\nAnd it should never happen to another President. That’s just a dishonest group of people. But here we are, and we’re going to be here for another four years. The governor of your state-\nCrowd: (03:30)\nBoo!\nDonald Trump: (03:34)\n… tried very hard to stop us from having this event tonight. He didn’t like us having… They can have riots and they can have all sorts of things and that’s okay, you can burn up the house, that’s okay. We call this a protest because if you call it a protest, you’re allowed to have it. It’s okay. So if anybody asks you outside, this is called a friendly protest, okay? It’s true. You can’t have political rallies. That’s because of me, because if Biden were here, he’d have about three people. Do you ever see him with his little circles? The circle? You know why he puts the circles? Because he wants to be like correct with COVID, but it’s not really because they can’t get anybody to fill up a room. So they put these big circles. So he can’t get anybody to fill. Nobody wants to go. Oh, boy, the fake news, look at all those people back there, the fakers.\nCrowd: (04:31)\nBoo!\nDonald Trump: (04:36)\nThat’s true. Boy, they covered. Did you see the other day, now they’re finding out that to do an interview, an interview, they ask him a question. That means they’re giving him the questions, they never gave me questions before. So to do an interview, he demands on getting the questions, and his people write out the answer. So they ask him a question. He goes, “Bring it up closer, I can’t see it, dammit.” Great. This is something. You know, we have a debate coming up in three weeks. And here’s the problem. Winston Churchill. Did you ever hear of Winston Churchill? Winston Churchill was a great debater. Great. And if Joe gets off the stage, walks off the stage, if he makes it, which I think he probably will, in all fairness, he’s been doing this for 47 years, right? I think he probably will. If he gets off the stage, they’re going to say it was the single greatest debate they’ve ever seen. Winston Churchill was nothing compared to Sleepy Joe.\nDonald Trump: (05:44)\nYou know that, you know that, they’re going to say, “What a great performance. He was great today. He was great. This guy was great.” Nah, he’s not great. But your governor tried to stop us. He tried to stop us. The governor of Nevada, he tried to stop us, and we went to different venues. Kelly O’Donnell, she’s a fading reporter for NBC. Do you know that? She was on, she said, “Well, they have a crowd tonight.” Behind her, it looked like 25,000 people. That’s what we have, by the way, a lot more coming in. But she said, “He’s got maybe a thousand people, a thousand.” You know what I got? I have a thousand people here. No, this is the fake news. You know what? It’s not a question of how many… They are just a bunch of dishonest people, I’ve never seen anything like it.\nCrowd: (06:46)\nBoo!\nDonald Trump: (06:46)\nBeing in real estate and being in New York and being in all over, I’ve seen a lot of dishonest people. I think the media, the fake news is the most dishonest group of people I’ve ever seen anywhere in my entire life. And that includes, by the way, leaders of foreign countries that aren’t our friends, okay? That’s a big statement. They really are bad news. But here we are, and this is really amazing. The governor tried to stop us, he couldn’t, but think of this, he’s in control of millions of votes. Here’s a guy calling venues, telling them not to have the rally, calling different venues, “Don’t have the rally. We’re not going to let you have the rally.”\nDonald Trump: (07:28)\nAnd he’s calling, this governor who was a political hack, he was a political hack, and then he became governor. And this is the guy that we’re entrusting with millions of ballots, unsolicited ballots, millions and millions. And then we’re supposed to win these states, and we have a guy that would do that where he won’t let us have, and we call it a protest and therefore we can do it. But you want to know something? It’s a disgrace. So who the hell is going to trust? They say, “Trust government.” Well, how would you trust a guy that fought that we aren’t here, that we can’t have all these thousands of people? Boy, you are really back far. That’s… Look at that.\nDonald Trump: (08:14)\nNo, but seriously. And now he’s in charge of the election and the millions of ballots. So if I’m up like millions of votes, he can rig the election, he can rig the election. And I’ll tell you what, whether it’s in North Carolina, whether it’s in Michigan, whether it’s in other states where they’re sending out, they’re going to be sending out 80 million ballots. And it’s Democrats. They’re trying to rig this election, at every single place in the last year, year and a half, go modern day, forget about… Tiny amounts, a congressional race in New York, a small number of votes. If you go to New Jersey, if you go to Virginia, if you go to Pennsylvania, if you go to California, look at some of these races, every one of these races was a fraud, missing ballots. And I don’t mean like 1%. I mean like 20%, 25%, they’re trying to rig the election.\nDonald Trump: (09:26)\nThey should make people, if you register, if you want a solicited ballot, that’s where you ask for it. You have to sign papers. You get it because you can’t be there. That’s one thing. When they send 80 million ballots to people, they have no idea where they’re going. Actually, they probably do have a good idea where they’re going, and that’s our problem. They send 80 million ballots out. Where are they going? Who are they sending them to? Are they sending them to certain areas and not other areas? Are they sending them to Democrat areas? These are all controlled by Democrat governors, like your politically motivated governor. So, just to finish on that, look, just to finish on that, he’s a guy that tried to silence us by not having this. And it ended up, our crowd turned out to be a lot bigger than NBC, which is owned by Concast. C-O-N, Concast. C-O-N-C-A-S-T, Concast. It’s really Comcast, but I call it con because it’s a whole con.\nDonald Trump: (10:35)\nI’ll tell you what, in the old days, I think it should still be, news when they broadcast had to be reasonably accurate, right? And they had licensing. Today, they can do whatever the hell they want. It’s fake news, and it’s a disgrace. And you know what, back there, and I’ll tell you, it’s hurting our country. It’s hurting our country. They’re the biggest problem that this country has is the fake news media, worse than the Democrats, because the Democrats are their partners. They play together. Joe Biden spent the last 47 years selling out America, offshoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, depleting our military and sacrificing your children’s future in China. I’ve spent the last four years bringing our jobs back to America, securing our borders, rebuilding our military and standing up to China like never before. Nobody has ever stood up to China like we have stood up to China, and you haven’t seen the last of it.\nCrowd: (11:38)\nUSA, USA, USA, USA!\nDonald Trump: (11:41)\nSleepy Joe Biden, who surrendered, you know where he is now, he’s in his damn basement again. No, he’s in his basement. He’s in his basement. But I can be bad to him because he put the most vicious ad on television that I’ve ever seen. Do you know what I’m talking about? Where I’m standing over the graves of our fallen warriors, our fallen heroes. These are great people, the greatest people there are, and I’m standing over there and they have some sleazebag reporter from a third rate magazine having some source quoting me saying, I won’t even use the term, but saying bad things. And there’s nobody that loves our military, respects it and the people more than me. And they took… And I didn’t even ask. We had 25 people that were witnesses that are on the record already that have said that never took place. It never took place, what they said. And yet pathetic Joe, and he’s a pathetic human being to allow that to happen. Here’s the problem, he doesn’t even know what happened, I don’t think. I think he has no idea, but he’s a pathetic human being to let that happen, where they put an ad like that, where I’m standing over graves. And then they said, “He said this,” with no sources, no nothing. They got nothing. And I have 25 real witnesses with the names, with everything, saying it never happened. And they put an ad like that up, they’re a disgrace. But you know the good part? Now I can be really vicious. I can be really vicious.\nDonald Trump: (13:25)\nAnd we’ll start by saying, we’re going to start by saying that the Democrats are trying to rig this election because it’s the only way they’re going to win. The only way they’re going to win is to rig it. Biden’s surrendered your jobs to China. Look, his son walked away with a billion and a half dollars, give me a break, give me a… His son’s going to say, “Dad, you can’t take this money away. Don’t do it, Dad, please, I don’t…” You know how much experience he had? There’s a young man here, he’s a very young, young man, handsome young guy. He’s about like 12. You know what? He’s got more experience than Hunter. Hunter.\nDonald Trump: (14:07)\nWhere’s Hunter? Where is he? With no experience, no knowledge of energy, no job, got thrown out of the military… You know he got thrown out, by the way. I used to be nice about that. Now I don’t. Once I saw that ad, I don’t have to be nice anymore. Okay, I really mean it. And by the way, on that ad, I know some horrible people, horrible human beings, some of the worst people in the world, I really do, they’re horrible, none of those people, and they’re the worst, the worst, real estate developers in New York, you don’t get much worse. I know some of the worst people in the world, not one person do I know that would say that, standing on top of graves, of heroes, really, not one person. So I will tell you this, so now we can play it like it is. Let’s face it, Joe is shot. Let’s face it, okay? He’s shot. So not that he has anything to do because he won’t know what’s happening. He’ll just be locked up in a room someplace, and the radical left is going to be running our country.\nDonald Trump: (15:14)\nFour more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years!\nDonald Trump: (15:16)\nThank you. But now he wants to surrender our country to the violent left wing mob. You know that. If Biden wins, China wins. If Biden wins, the mob wins. You see what’s going on with all these democratic or I always say Democrat-run cities and states. It’s a disaster. It’s a disaster. And we keep saying, “Let us bring in the troops.” Well, we did it in Minneapolis, we ended it. In 45 minutes, it was ended. They went through two weeks. By the way, we could do it in Portland in half an hour. It would all be over. But we have these stupid people that think… How about that poor mayor? Is that pathetic, Wheeler, is that pathetic? They forced him out of his home. He’s now finding a new home, it’s so nice. It’s pathetic. Honestly, it’s pathetic.\nDonald Trump: (16:08)\nWe could solve that problem in a half an hour, just like we did. And by the way, the US Marshals did a great job in Portland. They did a great job. You know what I mean. If Biden wins, the rioters win, the anarchists win, arsonists, flag burners, they all win. I’m running for reelection to bring prosperity to Nevada, to the whole country. I’ve been here a long time. I have some things in Nevada that are very good to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China. I do get a kick out of watching a guy, “Oh, I’m going to do this.” He copied my whole plan. You see, he says, “Buy America,” I said, “Where the hell have you been for the last half century?”\nCrowd: (16:58)\nWe love Trump, we love Trump, we love Trump, we love Trump, we love Trump!\nDonald Trump: (17:04)\nThank you.\nCrowd: (17:04)\nWe love Trump, we love Trump, we love Trump, we love Trump, we love Trump, we love Trump, we love Trump!\nDonald Trump: (17:15)\nCould I ask the fake news to take your cameras and show all the way back there for hundreds of yards, all the way back there. Take your cameras. Go as far as the eye can see. No, no, tell NBC News it’s not a thousand people. You can’t see it. You can’t see it down here. You won’t believe how many people. That thing goes back…\nCrowd: (17:45)\nUSA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA!\nDonald Trump: (17:59)\nSo the bottom line is when we win, America wins, that’s what’s happening. And nobody’s done to China what I did. Look, billions, tens of billions of dollars of tariffs we took in. I gave $28 billion to farmers. The farmers are doing very well. They’re doing very well. Thank you. Thank you, President Trump. 28 billion. 16 billion one year 12 billion. They were targeted. I said, “How much is it?” Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, great guy, said, “How much were they hurt by?” “Sir, 12 billion two years ago and 16 billion last year.” I said, “All right, good. We’ll take it out of China.” We gave them 28 billion, to the farmers. That never happened before. You think Joe Biden would even think about it? He wouldn’t even think about it. He wouldn’t even think about it. No, he’s more worried about, does he have a teleprompter to answer a reporter’s question.\nDonald Trump: (18:51)\nThe worst part about that isn’t the fact that he’s doing that, because let’s face it, he’s unable, okay? It’s not that, it’s that the fake news would give him the questions. They never gave me the questions. Did you ever give me questions, back there? Did you ever give me… They don’t give me questions. The fake news would give him questions, but of course now Donna Brazile works for Fox, so that’s gone a long way. Remember? Remember when Donna Brazile gave crooked Hillary the questions, right? To a debate? And then she said, “Well, I don’t think I did it. I don’t remember.” I knew she was in trouble when she said, “I don’t remember doing that. I don’t remember.” She didn’t remember. Oh, okay. Well, as long as you don’t remember.\nCrowd: (19:34)\nLock her up, lock her up, lock her up.\nDonald Trump: (19:36)\nIt’s true. It’s true too. It’s true.\nCrowd: (19:38)\nLock her up, lock her up, lock her up, lock her up, lock her up, lock her up.\nDonald Trump: (19:44)\nYou know what, I used to stand back and I’d say, “Be quiet, please. Don’t say that. It’s really not nice.” You know it’s true. She deleted 33… Think of it. They’ll never find the emails because they were acid washed, deleted. But you know what? She got a subpoena from the United States Congress, right? And she and her lawyer deleted 33,000 emails after she got a United States subpoena. And you say, “Why isn’t she guilty of a major crime?” Right? And then she took her telephones and she smashed them with a hammer. Right? And then she took the other ones, and she deleted them. And now the Mueller scam, these people, the worst people. I have a friend, a very smart guy, very streetwise guy. He said, “You have to be the most honest guy in the world to go through three years of investigations, where they have the worst human beings in the world.” They worked for the Democrats. They worked…\nDonald Trump: (20:42)\nI mean, Mueller didn’t have a clue. This guy was totally… But look at this Weissmann, how bad was Weissmann? He deleted his phone. That’s illegal. He deleted everything. They all deleted. And they all said, “Oh gee, we made a mistake. We’re sorry.” They all used the same mistake. They all made… It was, “Oh gee, we didn’t mean to do that.” Every one of them, all of them. I think it was 31 different phones, they deleted. These are criminals we’re dealing with. And they’ve got to… There has to be a repercussion. There has to be a repercussion. We’re dealing with criminals. So I don’t care if you say it anymore because you know what? She illegally deleted, and her lawyers should go to jail with her, okay?\nDonald Trump: (21:25)\nAnd the fact is the Republican party doesn’t play it rough and tough like those people, they don’t play it the same way. They’re too nice. And we have better policy. Thank goodness we have better… We believe in borders. We believe in no sanctuary cities. We believe in lowering taxes. We have better, but our people don’t… We have some that are very good. Jim Jordan, good, right?\nCrowd: (21:51)\nWe love you, Mr. President!\nDonald Trump: (21:53)\nJim Jordan. Mark Meadows, good, right? No, we have some very good, but I’ll tell you what, we play it so nice, and in the end it’s not right because what they get away with… And Obama and Biden got caught spying on our campaign using the intelligence, I put that in quotes, using intelligence to spy on our campaign, and they got caught. They got caught. And if it was me that got caught, forget about it. But they got caught and somebody said, ” Well I know, but he was President.” Oh great, I’m President too. And a hell of a lot better President than he is, I can tell you that. Obama came into office, they gave him the Nobel Prize, like almost immediately, right? In fact, he didn’t even know why he got it. He didn’t even know, he had no idea why he got it. And he was right about that because nobody else does either. They still don’t know, but we’ve done a lot of things. So we were nominated a few days ago for a Nobel Prize, which is a big thing. Nobel Peace Prize.\nDonald Trump: (23:14)\nAnd then yesterday we were nominated a second time for another Nobel Prize. Now, that’s a big thing. To me, it’s a big thing, even though obviously it’s a very political thing, but it’s a very big thing. The Nobel Peace Prize, right? I got, it was just reported. I’m just reporting this, I got zero time on the nightly news, on the network news. Zero, zero. We got zero time. Think of it, the President of your country is honored by being nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, and your nightly news, ABC, which is terrible, CBS, which is terrible, and probably the worst of all owned by Concast, they spend a fortune on PR, and then every time I get up, I call them Concast and sort of wipe out their fortune. But they are bad people. But NBC is the worst of them all, not one mentioned. These people are corrupt. Not one mentioned, not one mentioned.\nDonald Trump: (24:20)\nSo your President gets a Nobel and, at least a nomination, and they don’t mention it. Joe Biden cannot lead our country because he doesn’t really believe in our country. Right now, I don’t think he believes in anything, he just wants to go to sleep. That’s all. “Please, darling, I want to go to bed. I’m exhausted. I made one speech yesterday.” “But darling, they gave you the answers and the questions.” “I know, but that was a big strain because my eyes, I couldn’t see the teleprompter.” This guy is the worst. I am… And you know, it’s going to maybe come back to haunt me because we have a rigged election. It’s a rigged election. It’s the only way we’re going to lose, but I’ll tell you what, he is the worst candidate in the history of Presidential…\nDonald Trump: (25:03)\nHe is the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. He doesn’t know he’s alive. He doesn’t know he’s alive. And I got to know President Xi of China very well, President Putin of Russia, Kim Jong-un. By the way, what happened to the war? I thought we was going to war with Kim Jong-un. Where’s the war? Where’s the war? Oh, I see. Oh, I see. It never happened, did it? Never happened, did it?\nDonald Trump: (25:27)\nWell, maybe some day, could happen. No, remember? “Trump is going to be … ” You know my personality, right? “Trump is going to be a war at within the first week after he wins.” Where’s the war.?In fact, the peace prize was because I stayed out of wars, and by the way, ended certain Wars that could have happened that you don’t even know about. And look what we did just yesterday in Europe, and look what we did with Israel, and you just saw that, with United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain.\nDonald Trump: (26:04)\nFor 72 years, nothing happened, and we did it. We do it very fast. And plenty of other countries are going to be coming in. At Biden’s convention, they decried it. You’re a hell of a crowd. I’ll tell you. You’re [inaudible 00:26:15].\nAudience: (26:15)\n[crosstalk 00:01:17]-\nDonald Trump: (26:42)\nThank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Now, after this is over, you’ll have like at NBC, this third-rate reporter stand up. They had a small crowd, a insignificant crowd, in a great location. You know how great it was? We landed, we had to drive for 50 minutes. That’s how great. But I like it anyway. I’ll take it. I’ll take it anyway. I like it. You’re my kind of people. We love each other. I like it.\nDonald Trump: (27:22)\nWe landed the big, beautiful Air Force One. I just asked as we’re coming in, “Why couldn’t we have landed here?” I would have rather, then I could have had the plane right behind me. Instead, we have the beast. See the beast. What you don’t know is the beast costs almost as much as the plane. It’s a hell of a car. It’s a walking army tank, the beast. But we could have. I said, “Why don’t we just land here?” And we couldn’t. So I get off the plane. Oh, good. “How long will it be?” “About 50 minutes.” That’s a long drive. And driving here, there were tens of thousands of people on the streets with flags.\nDonald Trump: (28:12)\nAnd then you read these fake reporters and they say, “President Trump is tied in Nevada, tied.” I don’t think so. The only way we’re tied is if they screw around with the ballots, which they will do in my opinion. Okay? We’re not tied anywhere. I asked some people that traveled with Obama. I said, “Was it the same thing?” They say, “Not even a tiny fraction of what you have.” There’s not even a fraction. We have more enthusiasm. We have more spirit than any campaign that anybody’s ever seen. It’s true.\nDonald Trump: (28:53)\nAnd that includes 2016, where the enthusiasm obviously was great. How about all those states that we weren’t supposed to win? “No, he won’t win there. He won’t win there.” Then all night long, “Donald Trump won the great state of Texas. Donald Trump won the great state of … ” this and that, and one after another. Was that one of the coolest things, watching their people go crazy? They went crazy. No, they went crazy.\nDonald Trump: (29:24)\nHow is he going to do in Georgia? Well, I think George is going to be very close. It’s going to be very close. They go, “The polls in Georgia have closed. Donald Trump wins the state of Georgia.” You know why? Because we won by so much, that they can do it simultaneously by saying, “The polls closed, and he won.” We had many of them. Right? And by the way, we’re doing great. I just had … Florida is a biggie, a good one. And we are winning in Florida by a lot, so that’s good. A lot.\nDonald Trump: (29:47)\nI’ll tell you here, because you don’t read about that stuff. They don’t like to write that. They don’t like to write it. They have all fake polls. I’ll tell you what, the polls are worse than the writing. Actually, in my opinion, the polls, they’re suppression polls, they’re meant to make people discouraged, Even me, I’m supposed to be discouraged. And fortunately, four years ago, we weren’t discouraged, because if we would have believed the polls, nobody would have voted.\nDonald Trump: (30:14)\nThe concept is really make people feel so that on election, they go, “Darling, let’s go out to dinner. It’s so sad about the president. I wish he was going to win, but let’s go out to dinner. Then we’ll come home. Let’s not bother voting, right? Let’s not bother voting.” See, it’s a suppression, but my people might don’t get suppressed. My people go out and vote.\nDonald Trump: (30:35)\nMy people go out and vote. There’s no suppression. Phony polls. How about the guy? The New York times hired this pollster, this great genius. He never called one wrong. I don’t know. Three, 46.. I don’t know what the hell … It’s called three 40 … What’s his deal?\nSpeaker 1: (30:51)\nSilver.\nDonald Trump: (30:52)\nYeah. It’s Silver, Silver, Nate Silver. They pay him a fortune. He said, I think he gave us a 2% chance, A 3% chance, “Donald Trump has a 3% chance today of winning.” The damn thing was over by 10:00.\nDonald Trump: (31:11)\nWe were given a very tiny chance. What chance did he give us? Like 9%, something like that. You know, they gave him millions of dollars shortly before, because he never called one wrong. He called that one wrong. He called that one wrong. And this is the one … I mean, I must tell you they’re a little more accurate. At least here they have us even in a lot of places. ” He’s even.” Well, we’re not even, we’re not even.\nDonald Trump: (31:33)\nThis is going to be the greatest victory. This is a more important election than four years ago, I’ll tell you, more important. Because at no time before, has there been a clearer choice between two parties or two visions, two philosophies, two agendas for the future. There’s never been anything like this. On November 3rd, Nevada will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity, like we had.\nDonald Trump: (32:02)\nWe had the greatest economy in the history … not of our country, in the world. We were beating everybody. We were beating China. Remember, if you go back, some of you go back, if you go back 10 years, 15 years, five years, everything was … In 2019, China will overtake the United States as the largest economy. And that didn’t work out too well for them. That didn’t work out. We were just doing leaps and bounds. We were doing so great, and then we got hit with the plague, the China plague. And we’re not thrilled. It’s a disgrace. Nobody should have died. Nobody should have died. We got hit. The whole world got hit, but they stopped it from going into the rest of China. They stopped it from going into China, but they didn’t stop it from coming into the US and Europe and 188 countries.\nDonald Trump: (32:57)\nSo whether or not we allow Biden to impose the biggest tax increase in the history of our country, $4 trillion, or ban … He wants to ban energy, ban American … He wants to stop fracking. Hey, by the way, when he was running as a Democrat, in the worst debate performances I’ve ever seen. Okay? What do you think … He was unable to answer anything. Are you awake, sir? Sir, please wake up. And who was the worst? Who treated him the worst? Kamala. Kamala.\nDonald Trump: (33:29)\nShe’s another beauty. She started off as a favorite. She was at 15. Then she went down to 14, to 12, to 10. She was like a dropping rock in water. She was going down so fast. Then she went down to five and four and three, two, and then she said, “I got to get the hell out of here. This is getting embarrassing.”\nDonald Trump: (33:50)\nAnd nobody treated him worse than Kamala. Right? She called him a racist. She called him everything. She was horrible to him. And he says, “She was Kamala. She’s just great.” Oh, yeah. These people, these people. You’re supposed to choose the people that did well. She got out before Iowa, as I remember. Right? She didn’t want to run in Iowa, and then Bernie got … Again, this guy is the greatest loser ever because-\nAudience: (34:15)\n[crosstalk 00:34:15]-\nDonald Trump: (34:15)\nNo, no. No, he’s a good sport, Bernie, crazy Bernie. He’s so crazy, but he’s a good sport, because with Hillary, they really did.\nDonald Trump: (34:26)\nDo we have any young children here? I know it’s on a lot of television. Could you turn the television off just for a minute, just for about three seconds? He got screwed. Right? Okay. Now you can turn it back on. But then they really did with this last one, because if Pocahontas, Elizabeth Warren, if she would have left the race one day before the big Super Tuesday, I mean, Bernie would have her philosophy, right? Liberals.\nDonald Trump: (34:56)\nBy the way, you know who’s more liberal than Bernie? Kamala. She’s rated the number one most liberal … This is not for Nevada. This is not for [inaudible 00:35:04]. And I would say, she’ll be president. If he ever wants, she’ll be president within the first month or so, I would say. I think it’s just an excuse. Using him as just an excuse to get the super libs in there, so they can destroy our suburbs, demolish our Second Amendment, erase your borders and indoctrinate your children with poisonous, anti-American lies in school. So under my leadership, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And now we’re doing it again. We’re doing it again. You’ve seen the numbers. And we’re developing a vaccine in record time. It will be ready before the end of the year and maybe much sooner than that. They’re very unhappy about that. It’s amazing.\nDonald Trump: (35:56)\nWe have a couple of really great experts, one who’s … We call him Dr. Scott. You know who I’m talking about? He’s great. He said, this is the only time … They were grilling him on television, saying, “Well, the vaccine’s going too fast.” You know why that’s too fast? Because they don’t want it to happen before the election. He said, “This is the only thing in the world. I’ve never seen anything like it. Everybody wants a vaccine. And when we start getting it fast, because President Trump happens to be president … ” and we’ve done this in record time, years ahead of schedule. If this was Sleepy Joe and Obama, you wouldn’t have a vaccine for three years. But listen, he said, “This is the craziest thing.”\nDonald Trump: (36:32)\nSo you’re going to have a vaccine quickly. Right? And everybody’s upset about it. So now they’re trying to hurt the vaccine. And they’re trying to say as many bad … They know nothing about it, but they’re trying to hurt it, and it’s a shame. But he said it better than anybody I’ve heard. He said, “You’re trying to hurt this country by saying bad things about the vaccine, because we’re going to produce it early.” It’s the craziest thing. Think about it. Now, having a vaccine is good, but we’re rounding the turn regardless. We’re rounding the turn, and it’s happening. I mean, it’s happening. You see. Florida is way down. Texas is now way down. Arizona, governor’s done a great job. All three governors have done a great job. And Louisiana now, they had a spike, but they had the spike, but the spike was able to be handled, because now we understand. And what we did, we saved millions of lives, because I hated to do it, but we had to close it up, understand this disease, and then open up again.\nDonald Trump: (37:33)\nAnd we opened, but we would have had 2 million, two and a half, or three million people. Think of it. We’re at like around 180,000. One is too many. One, too many. But we would’ve had two and a half, three, three and a half million people. It would not have been acceptable, would not have been sustainable. We’ve done an incredible job. And these people that have done it with me, the ventilators, the vaccines, the therapeutics, these people … I mean the hospitals, the beds that we built, the ships that we sent to New York, the ships that we sent. To have an ungrateful governor in New York, Cuomo, to have an ungrateful governor. We sent him ships. We sent them ships. We sent them.\nDonald Trump: (38:19)\nWe built a convention center with 2,800 beds, and he didn’t use the beds for senior citizens. He hardly used the beds at all. He hardly used the ships at all. He said we did a phenomenal job, and now he gets political. He wants to get political with me. A real wise guy, but that’s okay. You got to see what they are doing between him and de Blasio. That’s a beauty. What they’ve done to my beautiful city. I love that city so much. What they’ve done is so horrible. The highest taxes in the land, crime all over the place. They’re like 300% up in crime. We need Rudy to come out of retirement. But we’re defeating the China virus. When Biden was vice president, he was a complete disaster on the swine flu, which was a much easier thing to handle. Joe Biden’s own chief of staff said that when Biden managed swine flu in 2009, they quote, “Did every possible thing wrong.” This is the guy that worked for him in charge of the swine flu. And 60 million Americans got H1N1 in a period of time. And it’s just purely a … He said it was just … we were lucky. He said, “It’s just lucky that there weren’t great mass casualties.” Different kinds of a disease, a little bit.\nDonald Trump: (39:37)\nAnd what he said is amazing. He said we did nothing right. This is the man that’s going to tell us all about building ventilators. You think Joe is going to be able to build thousands of ventilators a month? Which now we’re doing, and sending them to all these countries, all over the world, who have no hope of building ventilators, and they need them badly.\nSpeaker 2: (39:58)\nThank you [inaudible 00:14:58].\nDonald Trump: (40:00)\nSo it’s an amazing thing. The outbreak was so rampant that Obama-Biden, the administration, told States to stop testing immediately, and they ordered the CDC to stop counting cases because they looked like hell, okay? We didn’t do that. By the way, the reason we show so many cases, because we have the best testing program in the world, by far, by far.\nDonald Trump: (40:26)\nWe’ve tested more people than India, than many, many big countries put together. India’s second. We’re 44 million tests ahead of India. They have 1.5 billion people, and Prime Minister Modi calls me. He says, “What a job you’ve done with testing.” I said, “Explain that to these dishonest people back [inaudible 00:15:45].”\nDonald Trump: (40:47)\nBiden’s record demonstrates that if he had been in charge when the China virus arrived, hundreds of thousands of more Americans would have died. As vice president, he presided over the worst and the weakest and the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. You’ve heard that before. It was the most pathetic recovery since the Depression. No state was hit harder by Biden’s failure than Nevada. And I was out here and that right about that. You got hit hard. This is not the guy you want.\nDonald Trump: (41:20)\nBut under my administration, before the virus, we quickly achieved the lowest unemployment rate in the history of Nevada. And we’ll soon have it back there again. We’ll soon have it back there again, but I hope everybody here, 25,000 people, whatever the hell it is, including those people back there, they’re angry at me. I don’t know why we gave the press this good location, because … No, it blocks the people … thousands of people back there, and the press is blocking them. And I consider them much more important than I do the press. [inaudible 00:41:53].\nDonald Trump: (41:59)\nBut Biden wants to raise your taxes so high. He would eradicate your economy. He’d put on new regulations, and it wouldn’t be him again. I’m going to keep saying it. It will be the people that control him. He’s a puppet. And then he wants to do a complete shutdown. We’re setting records. We just set a job record for four months, 10.4 million people.\nDonald Trump: (42:21)\nListen to this. So when we had this pandemic worldwide, look, it’s a terrible thing that a thing like this happened. People were saying we could go to 41, 42% unemployment. You know what we are now? 8.4%. I don’t say that’s …\nDonald Trump: (42:38)\nIf you would have said that … And we have the strongest, highest stock market in history, so your 401ks are doing great. If he got in, we would have the greatest depression in the history of our country. I mean it. I think 1929 would look like good times. All right? Because he’d do everything wrong. He’d raise your taxes. He’d raised the hell out of interest rates. He’d do everything wrong. The Biden shutdown will permanently destroy the lives and dreams of tens of millions of Americans, inflict totally lasting harm on our children and lead countless deaths from suicide. Don’t forget when you do these shutdowns, your state is shut down.\nDonald Trump: (43:19)\nYou got a governor. You shut down, except if you have a riot. You’re not shut down for riots. Riots, you can have, they can burn the hell out of the Strip. They can burn the hell out of Reno. They can do whatever the hell they want if it’s a riot. But if you want to go to church, you can’t do it. If you want to be in a group of people, you can’t do it. But there’s a lot of harm done on the other side. There’s a lot of tremendous harm done. Remember, the cure can’t be worse. Remember that.\nDonald Trump: (43:51)\nAnd on the other side, drugs, suicide, depression, substance abuse of different kinds, heart disease. You have tremendous problems on the other side. Open your schools, open up. We got to open up this state. And I guarantee you …\nDonald Trump: (44:13)\nAnd by the way, the states that are open are doing really well. They’re doing much better than the ones that are closed. I don’t know if you’ve been seeing the numbers. And this is just arithmetic. The states that are open are doing great. The states that are closed, North Carolina, what he’s doing to that great state, he’s got it locked down, shut down. Michigan, what she’s doing. And we’re trying to get Big 10 football by the way, but we won’t even. Michigan, what she’s doing to Michigan is unbelievable.\nDonald Trump: (44:41)\nTake a look at what they’re doing to Pennsylvania. And here’s another governor in charge of millions of ballots. So I’m going to win Pennsylvania, but what’s he going to do with these ballots? Where are they going? Who are they sending? Who’s sending it back? Who’s signing? They don’t even have to have an authorized signature in Nevada. Do you know that? They don’t have to have …\nDonald Trump: (45:01)\nYou don’t have to have an authorized signature on a ballot? No. They’re trying to rig an election, and we can’t let that happen. I hope you’re all going to be poll-watchers, I hope you are, because with you people watching the polls, it’s going to be pretty hard to cheat. I’ll tell you, I wouldn’t want to be a cheater. They’ll figure a way. No, they are. It’s a very dangerous thing.\nDonald Trump: (45:23)\nIt’s a very dangerous thing, and I totally mean it. And I’ve been at it. And you see people. And by the way, it’s not even politics. It’s common sense. They said millions of ballots. People are getting ballots. People died and they’re getting ballots. They’re sending them to dogs. You see that? Dogs got ballot. Everybody’s getting ballots. Probably everybody, but Republican are going to get the ballots. Right? And they’re unsolicited. So when you say, solicited, because I like solicited better as a word than absentee. Absentee, nobody knows what the hell it’s supposed to represent. It’s not really a good definition. One is solicited, where you ask … You solicit the ballot.\nDonald Trump: (46:00)\nYou want it, you sign papers. They send it to you. You send it back. It’s okay. It’s good. But unsolicited, where they take millions of ballots. So what happens? I happen to think the postal people are great, but what happens if one of the post guys, before he gives the ballots, he takes a whole handful and hands them to some Democrat political operative, right?\nDonald Trump: (46:21)\nAnd so, he hands him a thousand ballots, and the guy doesn’t even have to … you don’t have to have verification to do that. Now, here’s the good news. We’re in front of a court. And hopefully, the court’s going to rule, because this is the greatest scam in the history of presidential politics. These people are … they’ve gone crazy.\nDonald Trump: (46:42)\nBiden and his party of liberal hypocrites want to lock law-abiding Americans in their homes, which is what they’re doing. And they want to keep them out of church. They really do. They’re fighting God, they’re fighting guns, and they’re fighting oil. Think of it. I don’t think they’ll do too well in Texas. Did you see where they said? “We think the race will be quite close in Texas, but the president has an edge.” Listen, I’m in favor of oil and energy. I’m in favor of religion and God. Okay? And I’m in favor of our great Second Amendment, guns.\nDonald Trump: (47:25)\nSo he’s against our Second Amendment. Okay, you know who he’d put in charge. Beto, Beto. Or as he says is, “Beto, Beto.” So when Beto was legit and then Ted Cruz beat him, and Ted did a very good job. I tell you, he did a great job. But Beto went totally south. He’s gone crazy. So he now is a big gun guy. He wants to take guns away from everybody. So who did Biden put in charge? Beto.\nDonald Trump: (47:54)\nRemember Beto was interviewed in some magazine or third-rate magazine, most of them are, but remember? And Beto said, this was at the beginning before he got beat to hell. I said, “He thought this was easy, didn’t he?”\nDonald Trump: (48:07)\nBut remember when Beto said, “I was born for this.” As soon as I hear somebody’s born for running for president, I said, “He’s out. That’s the end of him.” Nobody’s born for this. This is tough stuff. I had a great life, I’ll tell you. My life was so beautiful. What the hell did I do this for? But you know what? You know what? We are doing things that nobody’s ever done before.\nDonald Trump: (48:34)\nAnd I say it all the time, and that’s what makes me happy. We’re dealing with very sick and very bad and evil people. But I’ll tell you no administration in three-and-a-half years, no administration has done what we’ve done in the first three-and-a-half years. But they want to punish you for praying in church while they let agitators and arsonists burn your churches down.\nDonald Trump: (49:01)\nLook at Washington. They want to burn the churches down, and that’s fine. But you want to go pray in church, they won’t let you do that. Just last week, Biden proudly accepted the endorsement of pro-criminal, anti-police, Portland district attorney, who has a policy of releasing rioters, vandals, criminals, and violent extremists without any charges. No charges. Never saw anything.\nDonald Trump: (49:26)\nBy the way, all of these places were talking about are Democrat- run, Chicago, New York, Portland, Seattle. The only reason Seattle got settled, because they knew we were going in. We told them, “we’re going in tomorrow morning. We’re going to open it up. We’re going to take it.” It would have taken us 20 minutes. So they sent people that night, because they didn’t want to be embarrassed. But look at what we’ve done. And so, every place we’ve touched, we solved the crime, but they have to ask us. If they don’t ask us, we’re not supposed to do it, but maybe we do it anyway. And it usually takes anywhere from 25 minutes to …\nDonald Trump: (50:03)\nAnd it usually takes anywhere from 25 minutes to about one hour. Wasn’t that a beautiful sight though in Minneapolis, right? They’re burning the poor city down. I love that state. I think we have a chance of winning in that state, first time in many years for a Republican. They’re burning Minneapolis. You don’t think of Minneapolis that way, right? You don’t think of it. The city is burning down. You have this fake CNN reporter, what’s his name? Velshi, the nice shaved head. Maybe I should try that, should I try that? No, I don’t think … ” Donald Trump went down substantially in the polls, like about 40%. He showed up with a new haircut, it’s called the shave head.” Ali Velshi. And remember he said, “No, this is a friendly protest. It’s a friendly protest. And it’s really quite nice.” And people are throwing bottles at him, he’s being hit with tear gas. This is a friendly protest. And you look over his shoulder and the entire city was burning.\nDonald Trump: (50:55)\nDo you remember the scene? The thing looked like it was 30 blocks, it was just burning. And he’s talking about, this is all fake news and nobody would have known. I knew it before I did it, but I never knew it to this extent. I never knew it to this extent. It is corrupt. It’s fake and they shouldn’t be allowed to do it. They shouldn’t be allowed. These are far left lunatics that Biden selects to staff his government. There are policies Biden’s pledged to apply nationwide. You’re going to have the suburbs, they have a plan. It doesn’t matter, it’s a regulation, very horrible regulation for the … Does anybody live in the suburbs? Because if you don’t vote for Trump in the suburbs, okay.\nSpeaker 3: (51:38)\n[inaudible 00:51:38] Valley loves you!\nDonald Trump: (51:42)\nWomen that live in the suburbs. They say, “Oh, they don’t like Donald Trump.” I said, “I think they do.” Remember last time, remember it’s the same thing. No, it’s the same thing. Remember, last time, four years ago, “Donald Trump will not do well with women.” I said, “Why am I so bad? Donald Trump will not …” And then the votes started coming in. “He’s doing very well, Jim, with women, I don’t know what’s going on.” We did very well with women. We did well with everybody, we did well with everybody. But they have a regulation. And Ben Carson was fantastic, the head of HUD. I said, “Ben, they’re going to destroy the suburbs.” And they wanted Corey Booker to head that program. But the program was already doing damage. They were playing with the zoning so they could build projects in the suburb, projects in the suburbs. And I said, “We’re going to end it.” Somebody said, “Sir, let’s just amend it.” I said, “Nope, we got to end it. End it, I want to end it. I don’t want to have a lesser version.”\nDonald Trump: (52:46)\nBut if he gets in, they will open up that whole program. They’re going to open it up on steroids. They’re going to open it up to a level that you wouldn’t have believed possible. And he will drive you out of the suburbs. He will drive you out of the … he’ll drive you out of everything. They’re open up their … I call it the suburban destruction program because that’s what they’ve done. And it’s been a horrible program. It’s been very unfair to people with the American dream. And let me just tell you something. 30% of the people that live in the suburbs are minorities. They’re Hispanic, they’re Black, they’re Asian, it’s the American dream. And they want the American dream and they don’t want that to happen. That’s why I’m doing so well with African American, with Asian American, with Hispanic American and with women. But don’t let them ruin the suburbs because they will put that regulation back immediately, immediately. And don’t let them ruin the suburbs because the suburbs are a special place. The suburbs are the American dream.\nDonald Trump: (53:51)\nThat’s where everyone aspires to and that includes minorities and everybody. Don’t let them ruin the suburbs. And with that comes tremendous crime. And I was talking the other day, “Darling, somebody just moved next door. Who is it? It’s a representative of Antifa.” She will look at her husband, say, “Darling, we’re out of here. We’re out of here.” Antifa. Remember they were trying to blame other people. They don’t like to mention the name Antifa. I said, it’s Antifa and I was right. I was right. They’re bad people. And you know what, they have to pay a price for the damage and for the horror that they’ve caused, they have to pay a price. And it’s so easy. It’s so easy. A lot of them now are wealthy. They’re like these wealthy, spoiled kids that have no clue about life.\nDonald Trump: (54:44)\nThey’ve got arms that are about this big but they were heavy jackets with lots … and you look and you say, “Oh, that guy looks tough.” And then the jacket comes off and you see these two little … And they go home and they live in a basement too, their mom and dad’s basement. But Biden’s plan is to appease domestic terrorists and my plan is to arrest domestic terrorists. Joe Biden is a weak person. He does whatever his left wing, puppet masters demand, you know that. Look, Joe doesn’t know what’s going on, you know that. I mean, let’s be nice about it, okay. And I’m being nice when I say it. He’ll never be able to protect your family, your loved ones or your community. If Biden’s elected his radical supporters won’t just cause mayhem on the streets like you’re seeing, all Democrats. We could solve it so fast. Chicago, a few weekends, think of it, 72 people shot, this is shot. Somebody said, “You mean with bullets?” I said, “Yeah, with bullets.” 18 people died. Now we’re pulling our troops out of Afghanistan, out of Iraq, you see what’s happening.\nDonald Trump: (55:56)\nBut let me tell you but we don’t … there’s nothing like that over there. They don’t have 18 people killed or 12 people in a short period of time. Well, you have 70 people shot, where you have another weekend where they had, I think a few weekends ago, 38 people have been shot in Chicago. I said, 38? It’s not even believable. And now when these people say it, they make it … they try and play it down. And you’re sitting there, I said, “Did I just see 38 people were shot?” It’s just a terrible thing. And it could all be stopped. It could all be stopped so quickly. But they have to respect law and they have to have order. Law and order.\nDonald Trump: (56:37)\nBut these radical lefts will be running the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security and the United States Supreme Court. And you see what’s going on there. If we don’t … The next president, hopefully it’s going to be us, not me, us, but the next president is going to have one, two, three or four Supreme Court justice. It’s just, you know, just that time, right? Just that time, going to be a minimum of one, I would say, but it will be a one, two, three or four. And that’s going to change the whole makeup of the Supreme Court. That’s going to take away your guns. That’s going to destroy your second amendment. That’s going to change the whole rationale thinking on so many different subjects like you wouldn’t believe, including by the way, life, okay. Life, pro-life, anybody pro-life here? No, this is going to change the makeup of this country for 50 years. I don’t know that the country will survive 50 years, if that happens, it might not survive five years if that happens. But the next president and you saw, I put out a list of an additional number of very conservative, highly thought of, highly respected judges. And they are the only people that I will pick. Meaning the first list, the second list, it’s about 44, 45 people. They are the only people that I will consider for the Supreme Court of the United States. And I’m asking Joe Biden to do the same thing, but he can’t because he’s got a bunch of radical left maniacs that they want to put on the court. And nobody can get elected, not even with Democrats, rational Democrats, will they vote for some of these people to be on.\nDonald Trump: (58:24)\nSo far he’s refused to do it. I’m probably forcing him tonight to do something, but he should put out a list of his judges so that you know where you stand. Biden supports cutting police funding, you know that, abolishing … and by the way, did you see, we just got Chicago police today endorsed Trump. That’s not easy to do. Chicago. New York’s finest, New York’s finest endorse, Florida, Ohio, Texas. We have everybody. Is there a police officer in the country, if there is, they’ll do a commercial. This officer loves sleepy Joe Biden, he’s so tough on crime. So Biden’s been going down very rapidly in the polls. And now what he’s doing is he’s playing tough guy, that he’s tough on crime. And all of a sudden, he goes from demolished, demolish and defund, okay? But he goes from, let’s not give the police any money. Let’s not even say defund for him. His people want to defund the police. They actually have places, Seattle, they actually don’t want to have police. Minneapolis, they don’t want to have police. They don’t want to have police. What’s going to happen?\nDonald Trump: (59:37)\nYou saw the commercial we put up. A woman’s being murdered. “I’m sorry. We cannot take your call right now. We will call you back within the next 24 hours.” A woman’s being raped, right? “I’m sorry. We could not respond right now because we have been defunded, but we will try getting there within the next week.” This is what you’re going to have. I mean, that was a strong commercial. It had a big impact, but this is what you’re buying with a guy like this. This guy you’re going to have Portland’s all over this country. And we can’t allow that to happen. “Not here,” he says, “Not here in Nevada.” Well with your governor, it could happen here too, I can tell. They want to abolish bail. So they want to abolish cash bail like they did in New York. They release people, the horrible criminals in New York, they release them, no cash bail. And he calls law enforcement, Biden called law enforcement the enemy. They’re not the enemy. They’re our friends. They’re our great friends.\nDonald Trump: (01:00:39)\nAnd without them, we wouldn’t be here. Here in Nevada rioters burned the city hall in Reno. Does anybody know that? Do you know that? That’s not a pleasant sight. How did you allow that to happen? I would’ve thought you people would’ve gotten out there, like, “You’re not going to burn our city hall.” And during the violent demonstrations in Las Vegas a 29- year-old police officer, you know about this, was deliberately shot in the head while he was doing his job, a vicious criminal left, he was a left person, a left. He was a real left, all right. And the, the young officer as you know, he’s a young, brilliant, young guy and he’s totally paralyzed. Unlike Biden, while I’m President of the United States, I will always stand with the heroes of our law enforcement. And on November 3rd, you will save America. You’re talking about saving America. We cannot let this happen to our country. Because I don’t know if you can ever come back from what will happen, including our Supreme Court.\nDonald Trump: (01:01:44)\nWe’re joined tonight by our terrific Republican congressional nominee, who has my complete and total endorsement. Jim, where you Jim? Jim Marchant, Jim Marchant, where are you? A lot of people out there, Jim, it’s not easy. Are you doing well? I just looked at a very solid poll. Jim Marchant is a great guy and hopefully he’s going to win and you’re going to carry them over and you need it, you need it. Thank you, Jim. And also to a man that should have been governor. He should have been governor, what happened? I don’t know what happened. Nevada Attorney General, he’s a great guy, Adam Laxalt. And he’s watching very closely. And I’ll tell you, Adam, please, he’s a great lawyer, a great talent. And he’s going places but you have to watch. He just said, our next governor. I believe that’s true. You have my endorsement, but I will tell you this, Adam, if you could, because you’re doing a fantastic job watching, watch all these votes coming in on the ballots, the unsolicited ballots. Will you watch it, please? Okay, all right.\nDonald Trump: (01:03:02)\nAll right, James Settelmeyer. Where’s James? James, look at James, whoa. Look at the size of James, I want you protecting me, James. James is good. You’re doing well, I saw a good poll for you too. I think we’re all doing well. I think we’re all doing well, it’s like a family. Thank you James very much. All of you guys, thank you very much. A woman who did a fantastic job, she headed up Michigan. We won Michigan, the first time in decades, Republicans won. She was horrendous, she kept calling me, “Sir, one more speech, please come over. Okay, I’ll do one more, Ronna, Ronna McDaniel. I’ll do one more, Ronna, one more.” I do the speech, two days later, I get a call. “One more, sir. We need one more.” But we ended up winning Michigan, first time in decades. Ronna McDaniel, Ronna. She was great.\nDonald Trump: (01:03:52)\nAnd I said when I won, I said, “Well, who are we going to put at the RNC?” That’s Republican National Committee, who we’re going to put? And I said, ” How about that woman that ran …” She was so tough. I said, “How about the woman that ran Michigan that we won, first time in so many years?” So thank you, Ronna, great job you’re doing, we appreciate it. And another man is doing a fantastic job, who’s been a friend of mine for a long time, your GOP chair, Michael McDonald. Michael, great job, Michael. Thank you, Michael. Thank you, Mike. How are we doing, Michael? Are we leading, I hope? Okay. I hear we’re doing well. Be careful of the ballots, that’s the only way we’re going to lose. Can’t have this happen to our country.\nDonald Trump: (01:04:45)\nAnd also here are several really great members of a terrific association and they like Trump a lot, the Nevada Trucking Association. Where are they, Nevada Trucking? Nevada Trucking, thank you, thank you. Thank you, fellas, thank you very much. Great job, we appreciate it very much. Those roads are going to get very nice. They’re already starting. Tonight our hearts are with all of the communities in the West battling devastating wildfires. I’m going there the day after tomorrow. I’m staying in your state tonight, but I’m going to be going to California. Spoke to the folks in Oregon, Washington, they never had anything like this, but it is about forest management. Please remember the words, very simple, forest management, please remember. It’s about forest management and other things but forest management.\nDonald Trump: (01:05:41)\nMy administration is closely coordinating with state and local leaders and we want to thank the more than 200,000 people that are working on it and 28,000 firefighters and first responders who courageously and bravely are fighting out there. They are fighting and it’s dangerous, it’s dangerous. It’s rapidly spreading, hundreds of thousands of acres, it’s not been anything quite like this one. We spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage Joe Biden inflicted over the past 47 years. Think of it, he’s been there 47 years. And he always says, “Well, why didn’t you do this? Why did …” The guy just really in all fairness, I’ve been here three and a half years. So it’s not like they haven’t been here. He was a vice president for eight years and he only did one thing good. He treated Obama good. I was going to say something else, but they would have scolded me.\nSpeaker 4: (01:06:33)\nKissed his ass.\nDonald Trump: (01:06:35)\nThat’s exactly what I was going to say, but I didn’t. It’s better than you say it. Do you want to shout it out? Go ahead, shout.\nSpeaker 4: (01:06:42)\nHe kissed his ass.\nDonald Trump: (01:06:43)\nThat’s what I said, that’s what I was … thank you very … This can only happen in Nevada. And we pass record tax cuts and regulation cuts to keep the family farms and ranches in the family. Nobody even knows this. We virtually eliminated the unfair estate tax, also known as the death tax. Does anyone have a small farm, medium-sized farm or business? Anybody? If you want to leave it to your children, you don’t have to pay tax now because of Trump. I always say it and I mean it, if you like your children, it’s great. If you don’t like your children, it doesn’t mean a damn thing, don’t leave it to them. I ended the administrations … and if you look at that last administration, what they were doing on American energy, what they were doing, and now we are the world’s number one energy producer by far and we are energy independent.\nDonald Trump: (01:07:41)\nHow about your gas prices? That’s not too bad, right? You didn’t think you’d ever see those prices, those under two dollar prices, did you? Thank you President Trump, I appreciate it, sir. Biden has pledged to abolish the production of American oil and shale and clean coal and natural gas, and he wants to ban fracking, right? So he’s in these debates with the other people and they’re just eating him alive. He did his best debate against crazy Bernie and I got to ask, why did he get better, all of a sudden? What happened? Why, do you have any idea why? I think I know. Why did he get better all of a sudden? But he did his last event, but he was so bad. And he raised his hand, no fracking. “There will be no fracking under my administration,” he said. And you know why I add the word, he said, because they will take what I said and they will put it as a commercial. There will be no fracking under my administration, they’ll have me saying that. That’s how dishonest these people are.\nDonald Trump: (01:08:38)\nSo I always have to add something because … but even then sometimes they’ll cut it off at the end. But he said, there’ll be no fracking under my administration. Now, all of a sudden he goes to Pennsylvania and his polls aren’t looking very good because they do big fracking. And he goes to Texas and he goes to Oklahoma and he goes to North Dakota and he goes to all these places. It’s not looking so good. All of a sudden he says, “I have nothing against fracking. What are you talking about?” But always follow their first instinct because the first instinct is what is going to happen. And he has to, because he signed … he has a manifesto. I call it the manifesto with Bernie and AOC plus three, all these crazy people. And it’s a manifesto and it reads far worse than anything Bernie Sanders ever said. I thought he’d take what Bernie did and move them somewhat to the right. No, he took what Bernie said and they moved way further left. It’s the craziest thing I’ve ever seen. But follow the original statements because that’s what’s going to happen.\nDonald Trump: (01:09:38)\nWhether it’s on religion or on guns or on fracking or on energy or anything, that’s what’s going to happen. California has already implemented this extreme agenda and they are experiencing massive blackouts, you know that, California. They like wind, they like wind. “Oh, darling, let’s watch television. I’m sorry, darling. The wind, the wind isn’t blowing tonight we can’t watch television. But I want to watch President Trump, he’s on television. I want to watch him. Darling, how many times do I have to tell you? The wind is not blowing tonight.” And the government came and turned off all the windmills because they’re killing all our bald eagles and all our birds. It’s unbelievable. You want to see a bird cemetery walk under a windmill sometime. They pile up. Honestly, it’s terrible. Then the environmentalists will say, oh, that’s so wonderful. You know what, when they talk about fumes, when they talk about going up, the carbon, going up, take a look where they’re made. They’re made in China and they’re made in Germany. They spew more crap into the air than anything. You can run those things for 15 years and they’ll never make up the difference. But here’s what happens, after a certain number of years, they wear out. And did you ever see a windmill when it’s shot, like Joe, what happens? No, you know what happens to it. It starts to rust, they don’t paint it. The maintenance gets bad and then they just turn it off. Take a look at California where they have windmills that have been … that are old. And nobody wants to take them down because it’s not a lot of profit in taking them down. So they’re sitting there all rotten and rusty, it’s terrible. And then I hear the environmentalists love them. We got to talk to the environmentalists [inaudible 01:11:26].\nDonald Trump: (01:11:28)\nAnd they cannot … you know solar, I like solar, but solar is very expensive and it doesn’t have the power to fire up our massive plants. We have big plants, including in this great state and you can’t fire them up with this stuff. You can’t fire it. We need the strength because we’re competing against a lot of nations and they don’t go through what we do. They don’t care about the air and they should, and they should, which is another problem. I took you out of that crazy Paris Climate Accord, because it was totally disaster. No, it was a way of hurting the United States. I tell you, we would have had a close 20, 25% of our factories in order to even … it was so crazy, so expensive but I took you out. I was surprised people, most people, they appreciate what I did. Because you think it was easy doing that? It was actually, I thought it would be devastating. I got one day of bad press, after that, everybody forgot about it. It wasn’t that bad. But I did the right thing for our country and we want to have our great plants working. We want to have our great plants fired up.\nSpeaker 5: (01:12:29)\nFour more years!\nDonald Trump: (01:12:31)\nThey said manufacturing jobs are dead, right? Sleepy Joe said, “I’m going to bring back manufacturing.” Really? Well, Obama said, you’d need a miracle to bring back manufacturing. I brought back 650,000 jobs. He said you’d need a miracle. And now sleepy Joe is saying that, no, no, no. I’ve got to bring back … He’s not going to bring back anything. I made history by signing an executive order making the official policy of the United States government to buy American and to hire American. Now I did this long time ago. And then I see a sign in front of Joe right here, right here, it said, buy American. Oh great, Joe, thanks, Joe. Where have you been for 47 years? Because for 47 years, Joe Biden did the opposite. He crushed the dreams of American workers and enriched foreign countries. That’s how China happened. Hey, look what I’ve done. I’ve taken billions, tens of billions of dollars out of China. Nobody else did it before me, I mean, no other president. In all fairness, in all fairness to Obama and Biden, I call him, Obiden because it’s easier, Obiden.\nDonald Trump: (01:13:41)\nIn all fairness to Obiden, I mean, they didn’t do any of that. But now I see buy American. Hey, he also copied on the pandemic. Did you see he copied everything I was doing? Except one thing, he wouldn’t have closed the country to China so hundreds of thousands of people would have died from that. But two months, two and a half months later, he admitted that I was right. Thank you very much, Joe, I appreciate it. And yesterday he made, I think he made a mistake. Well, what do you think, the USMCA, what’s better that or NAFTA? Well, no, the USMCA is better. Was that Jake Tapper? I like Jake Tapper, was that … I don’t think he was doing … I don’t think he likes me too much, but that’s okay. They said what’s better, they said, what’s better. He goes, “USMCA. Well, that’s the deal that Trump made. Oh, it is? Oh.”\nDonald Trump: (01:14:34)\nThat’s a great deal we made. We took the horrible NAFTA deal. We got rid of the NAFTA. We got rid of TPP. We got rid of that terrible, terrible South Korea deal, which Hillary Clinton said, will produce 250,000 jobs. She said, this will produce 200 … she made it. Hillary, crooked Hillary. She made it, no wait, she said it’s going to produce 250,000 jobs. And she was 100% right, it produced 250,000 jobs for South Korea, not for us.\nDonald Trump: (01:15:03)\nIt produced 250,000 jobs for South Korea. Not for us. South Korea did very well with that deal, but I changed that deal a lot. That’s now a good deal. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to American workers. When we ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new USMCA Mexico-Canada Agreement into law.\nDonald Trump: (01:15:21)\nYou’re not going to see companies leaving for Mexico very much anymore. They’re not going to be leaving your community, going to Mexico, making a product, selling the product back in, not being taxed at the border. Doesn’t work that way anymore.\nDonald Trump: (01:15:35)\nIt’s probably the biggest reason I ran for president if you want to know that… and these stupid, endless wars. I saved the Uni-… but that’s one of the reasons Washington doesn’t like me. They love those endless wars. You got to ask them, “Why?” Do you ever watch where they’re very critical of me.\nDonald Trump: (01:15:51)\nI mean, “We don’t like him on foreign policy.” Really? Look what I’ve done. Look what I’ve done. Israel… We’re signing deals all over the place. These guys that are lecturing all the time, they don’t have a clue. They’re clueless. They were clueless. That’s why for 40 years you got nothing except blood in the sand. That’s all you got. Blood in the sand.\nDonald Trump: (01:16:11)\nI saved the US auto industry by withdrawing from last administration’s job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China’s rampant theft of American jobs. They don’t like me too much. Joe Biden’s agenda is, “Made in China”. My agenda is, “Made in the USA”. That’s the way.\nDonald Trump: (01:16:37)\nFor the last four years, I’ve been delivering for our incredible Hispanic… I love a Hispanic community. Oh, there was a poll today. Did you see it? Did you see the poll? Oh, this was a biggie. They had a poll today that with the Hispanic voter, they call them Latino, Hispanic. They use different terms. To me, I just loved the people. I don’t care, but let me just… Did you see it?\nDonald Trump: (01:17:05)\nTrump is leading Biden with the Hispanic community. Trump is leading Biden. Well, Hispanics like tough people. They like people that are going to produce jobs. They like… And by the way, the Hispanics understand the border better than anybody else. They’re better than anybody else. No, but we’re being… you know, it’s unusual that a Republican would be leading a Democrat, not… it’s habit. You know what the problem is, it’s habit. But the Hispanics get it.\nDonald Trump: (01:17:45)\nAnd we’re leading with the Hispanic community. And that’s because you had the lowest job numbers in the history of our country. You had the best home ownership. Every statistic was the best. And now we’re doing it again, except we’re doing it very rapidly. Remember 8.4%. We could have been at 44%, if stupid people ran it, 8.4%.\nDonald Trump: (01:18:08)\nI’m fighting for school choice, safe neighborhoods, low taxes and regulations on Hispanic-owned, small businesses. We’re fighting. You know, the Hispanic-owned, small businesses, they’re great business people. I know it from being in business. They were very tough. They were great business people and they get it. They get it like very few people get it. I’m also standing up for religious liberty.\nDonald Trump: (01:18:33)\nJoe Biden would be… So Joe Biden would be a disaster for all communities, not just the Hispanic communities, pledged to wage attacks on Catholic organizations, like the Little Sisters of the Poor that we’re helping. And we’re winning with them. We’re helping them. They got hit so hard by Oh Biden. They got hit so hard. I remember them in the Supreme Court, the Little Sisters of the Poor. They get hit by Biden. And then he says, “How wonderful.” He’s such a wonderful person. He supports taxpayer-funded, extreme, late-term abortion. And I mean, ninth month, ninth month, ninth month.\nDonald Trump: (01:19:22)\nAnd he’d allow violent mobs to burn down your business. And he would hand your country over to the socialists. But I believe it’s worse than socialists. I do. I think it’s a step worse than socialist. And it starts with a C. That is why we’re going to win a record share of the Hispanic vote in November. So important. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\nDonald Trump: (01:19:48)\nIt’s so important. We’re bringing it back very fast. I think next year is… Next year, I believe will be as good or better than the year we had last year. Unless somebody comes in and decides to quadruple your taxes, then I can’t. Then all bets are off, but we’re going to have… We’re lowering taxes. He’s raising taxes. We’re going to have tremendous growth.\nDonald Trump: (01:20:10)\nJoe Biden’s party continues to attack our incredible border agents. They’re incredible people, more than half of whom happen to be Hispanic-Americans. Did you know that? I know all of them. “Jose, how you doing?” “Juan, how you doing?” Every sixth time, I’d say, “Hello, Jim, how are you?” These extraordinary patriots deserve our admiration, gratitude and respect, not Joe Biden’s contempt. He’s got contempt for these people that are so great and brave.\nDonald Trump: (01:20:42)\nThat’s a tough job. My administration’s achieved the most secure border in American history. We ended the catch and release disaster. Remember you’d catch somebody, “What’s your name?” “I don’t know.” “What’s your address?” “I don’t know.” “Okay. Go into our country. That’s okay.” You couldn’t arrest anybody. We ended it, stopped asylum fraud and we’ve deported over 20,000 gang members, including MS13 and over a half a million criminal illegal aliens.\nDonald Trump: (01:21:11)\nNow think about it. Think of that number. Think if you at a half a million people spread throughout the country that were criminal, illegal aliens. Some of these are very violent people and we get them the hell out. We’re stopping human trafficking, protecting the victims, most of whom are women, most of whom are women. Human trafficking because of the internet that’s a tremendously big and horrible business. These are the worst human beings of all.\nDonald Trump: (01:21:40)\nBut most of the victims are women, children to a much lesser extent, but women and human traffickers. And you know what made it that way is the internet. Who would think? It almost sounds like an ancient crime. It’s not. It’s very modern because of the internet because of the computer. And it’s a horrible thing and we’ve stopped so much of it. We have an incredible group of people that go after these animals.\nDonald Trump: (01:22:05)\nAnd we built now over 320 miles of border wall and are adding 10 new miles a week. And the wall will very soon be finished. It’ll be finished. We’ve invested $2.5 trillion in the US military. We’ve rebuilt our depleted… It was a depleted military. Now we have the newest, we have the best we’ve ever had and launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in nearly 75 years, the US Space Force.\nDonald Trump: (01:22:41)\nAnd we did things that people said couldn’t be done. After 52 years, we passed VA Choice in VA Accountability and 91% of our veterans now approve of their VA care. They think it’s doing great. The fact is I did more in 47 months as president than Joe Biden did in 47 years. It’s true. It’s true. I withdrew from last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi.\nDonald Trump: (01:23:20)\nWe eliminated the world’s number one terrorist and mass murderer of American troops, Qasem Soleimani. He’s dead. He’s gone. Biden voted for the Iraq War. He opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed killing Soleimani. He oversaw the rise of ISIS and he cheered the rise of China as a very positive development. Oh, really? Tell me about it. Tell me about it. Not too positive.\nDonald Trump: (01:23:48)\nJoe Biden has been on the wrong side of history for 47 years. In fact, the secretary of state, secretary of defense said about him, “He’s never called it right. He never called it right.” If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would right now have died. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. You know that, especially with ventilators and equipment and masks and shields.\nDonald Trump: (01:24:18)\nWe’re delivering life-saving therapies that have achieved among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world. And you don’t hear that from the fake news. Europe’s excess mortality rate is 24% higher. And these are statistics that come from people that do this stuff, right? This is not done by my secretary. 24% higher than the United States and despite their punitive lockdowns, they’re once again seeing a spike.\nDonald Trump: (01:24:47)\nThey’re seeing a big spike in cases over there. They did the heavy lockdowns, just like you’re doing right here. And they’re seeing a spike. And there’s no reason for that. The United States has experienced the smallest contraction of any major Western nation. Think of that. And by far, the fastest recovery.\nDonald Trump: (01:25:09)\nAnd if they wrote about it properly, it would be a proper thing, a proper thing to do. Through our historic relief programs, we’ve saved more than half a trillion Nevada cops and jobs and all of this yet. So many people going out. We’ve saved 42,000 Nevada businesses. Think of that.\nDonald Trump: (01:25:26)\nBiden would terminate this comeback. He wants to end it. He would terminate this comeback. He would put your families in danger. He will totally destroy Social Security. And in my opinion, if you look at what he’s going to do to Medicare, they will destroy Social Security. They will. You called it. You know what you’re talking about? Exactly, right.\nDonald Trump: (01:25:49)\nHe’s going to massively raise your taxes. Reimpose crippling federal regulations, destroy your Social Security and destroy protections for pre-existing conditions. He’s going to destroy that and decimate your 401ks and retirement savings and stocks. Your stocks are going to go down like you never saw anything go down before. He’ll obliterate your Second Amendment. He’ll give you… And he would, he would give free… He wants to give free healthcare to illegal aliens that will bankrupt Medicare.\nDonald Trump: (01:26:21)\nHe wants to give… You saw him raise his hand. Remember the debate where they’re all standing there and he looked around, “Who’s going to give free healthcare to illegal aliens?” And everyone’s raising hands. He’s going, “Oh…” Now take a look. I’m not kidding. It’s sad. It’s pathetic.\nDonald Trump: (01:26:41)\nHe would end our travel bans on jihadist regions and increase refugee admissions 700%, opening the flood gates to terror-afflicted nations. You understand that. He’ll establish a national sanctuary city policy for criminal, illegal aliens. He loves sanctuary cities, meaning the people that control him love sanctuary cities.\nDonald Trump: (01:27:02)\nBiden, pledges to oppose school choice. And he has stated that if he is elected charter schools are “gone”. They’re gone. In the second term, and we’ve already started it very heavily, I will provide school choice to every parent in America.\nDonald Trump: (01:27:24)\nA vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs and a limitless future for all Americans. Instead of letting Washington change us, despite all that we’ve been through and we’ve been through more than any president has ever been through with these characters and they’re falling one after another. But you do notice that I hope. One after another. Oh, I see the phones have been wiped out. I wonder what that’s all about, but that’s a criminal thing you did. We are changing Washington. We are changing Washington.\nDonald Trump: (01:27:55)\nNever forget that they’re coming after me because I am fighting for you. And it’s true. Over the next four years to conclude, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all.\nDonald Trump: (01:28:18)\nWe will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring economies and a record prosperity, even greater than last year. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities and ban sanctuary cities.\nDonald Trump: (01:28:48)\nWe will appoint prosecutors, judges, justices, and believe… We will believe in enforcing the law. We want law and order. We have to have it. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms.\nDonald Trump: (01:29:25)\nWe will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless foreign wars. And we are bringing our troops home as we speak tonight. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength.\nDonald Trump: (01:29:48)\nWe will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. It’s already signed, starts on January 1st. I don’t want anyone to… I know ours is a big deal. I don’t want Sleepy Joe to take care of… Can you imagine? I’ll be watching. “Prices have dropped substantially all throughout the country because of price…” And I’m the one that got it done.\nDonald Trump: (01:30:11)\nAnd he’ll say, “What did I do? What did I do? How did this happen?” And we’ll further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs. We just did favored nations. We’re going to come down to the lowest price anywhere in the world because we did a favored nations clause. You know what that is? We will… The drug companies don’t exactly like me too much. They’re spending millions of dollars on negative commercials.\nDonald Trump: (01:30:35)\nPlease understand when you see those commercials, it means your drug prices are coming down. We will strongly protect Medicaid and Social Security, which they will give up. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions and America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. And we will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, “In God We Trust.”\nDonald Trump: (01:31:36)\nFor years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of Nevada. So very importantly, get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers and get out and vote on November 3rd.\nDonald Trump: (01:32:04)\nFrom Carson City to Elko, from Las Vegas to Reno and from Clark County to right here in Douglas County, we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded American patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty. They want to secure our liberty. Think of it and defend our freedom. Nevada was founded by pioneers and prospectors, miners and cowboys, innovators and trailblazers, tough people, great people who tamed the frontier, raised up the mighty Hoover Dam, lit up the brilliant lights of the Vegas Strip and transformed a sprawling desert into a shining oasis. So true.\nDonald Trump: (01:32:52)\nOur American ancestors made this into the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth. And we are making it greater than it ever has been. We are making it greater than ever before. We are making it greater than it’s ever been. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country.\nDonald Trump: (01:33:20)\nWe are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We’re going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.\nDonald Trump: (01:33:47)\nAnd together with the incredible people of Nevada, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again.

Read the full transcript of thee rally here.\nTranscribe Your Own Content\nTry Rev and save time transcribing, captioning, and subtitling.\nDonald Trump: (02:14)\nWell, I thank you very much. So I want to start by saying, “Hello, Nevada. How are you doing? How are you?” And I’m thrilled to be in Douglas County, but people are coming from all over the place. There’s a lot of people for Douglas County, isn’t it? We have thousands and thousands of loyal, hardworking American patriots, that’s what we have. And 52 days from now, we’re going to win Nevada, and we’re going to win four more years in the White House. And then after that we’ll negotiate, right? ‘Cause we’re probably, based on the way we were treated, we’re probably entitled to another four after that.\nDonald Trump: (03:15)\nAnd it should never happen to another President. That’s just a dishonest group of people. But here we are, and we’re going to be here for another four years. The governor of your state-\nCrowd: (03:30)\nBoo!\nDonald Trump: (03:34)\n… tried very hard to stop us from having this event tonight. He didn’t like us having… They can have riots and they can have all sorts of things and that’s okay, you can burn up the house, that’s okay. We call this a protest because if you call it a protest, you’re allowed to have it. It’s okay. So if anybody asks you outside, this is called a friendly protest, okay? It’s true. You can’t have political rallies. That’s because of me, because if Biden were here, he’d have about three people. Do you ever see him with his little circles? The circle? You know why he puts the circles? Because he wants to be like correct with COVID, but it’s not really because they can’t get anybody to fill up a room. So they put these big circles. So he can’t get anybody to fill. Nobody wants to go. Oh, boy, the fake news, look at all those people back there, the fakers.\nCrowd: (04:31)\nBoo!\nDonald Trump: (04:36)\nThat’s true. Boy, they covered. Did you see the other day, now they’re finding out that to do an interview, an interview, they ask him a question. That means they’re giving him the questions, they never gave me questions before. So to do an interview, he demands on getting the questions, and his people write out the answer. So they ask him a question. He goes, “Bring it up closer, I can’t see it, dammit.” Great. This is something. You know, we have a debate coming up in three weeks. And here’s the problem. Winston Churchill. Did you ever hear of Winston Churchill? Winston Churchill was a great debater. Great. And if Joe gets off the stage, walks off the stage, if he makes it, which I think he probably will, in all fairness, he’s been doing this for 47 years, right? I think he probably will. If he gets off the stage, they’re going to say it was the single greatest debate they’ve ever seen. Winston Churchill was nothing compared to Sleepy Joe.\nDonald Trump: (05:44)\nYou know that, you know that, they’re going to say, “What a great performance. He was great today. He was great. This guy was great.” Nah, he’s not great. But your governor tried to stop us. He tried to stop us. The governor of Nevada, he tried to stop us, and we went to different venues. Kelly O’Donnell, she’s a fading reporter for NBC. Do you know that? She was on, she said, “Well, they have a crowd tonight.” Behind her, it looked like 25,000 people. That’s what we have, by the way, a lot more coming in. But she said, “He’s got maybe a thousand people, a thousand.” You know what I got? I have a thousand people here. No, this is the fake news. You know what? It’s not a question of how many… They are just a bunch of dishonest people, I’ve never seen anything like it.\nCrowd: (06:46)\nBoo!\nDonald Trump: (06:46)\nBeing in real estate and being in New York and being in all over, I’ve seen a lot of dishonest people. I think the media, the fake news is the most dishonest group of people I’ve ever seen anywhere in my entire life. And that includes, by the way, leaders of foreign countries that aren’t our friends, okay? That’s a big statement. They really are bad news. But here we are, and this is really amazing. The governor tried to stop us, he couldn’t, but think of this, he’s in control of millions of votes. Here’s a guy calling venues, telling them not to have the rally, calling different venues, “Don’t have the rally. We’re not going to let you have the rally.”\nDonald Trump: (07:28)\nAnd he’s calling, this governor who was a political hack, he was a political hack, and then he became governor. And this is the guy that we’re entrusting with millions of ballots, unsolicited ballots, millions and millions. And then we’re supposed to win these states, and we have a guy that would do that where he won’t let us have, and we call it a protest and therefore we can do it. But you want to know something? It’s a disgrace. So who the hell is going to trust? They say, “Trust government.” Well, how would you trust a guy that fought that we aren’t here, that we can’t have all these thousands of people? Boy, you are really back far. That’s… Look at that.\nDonald Trump: (08:14)\nNo, but seriously. And now he’s in charge of the election and the millions of ballots. So if I’m up like millions of votes, he can rig the election, he can rig the election. And I’ll tell you what, whether it’s in North Carolina, whether it’s in Michigan, whether it’s in other states where they’re sending out, they’re going to be sending out 80 million ballots. And it’s Democrats. They’re trying to rig this election, at every single place in the last year, year and a half, go modern day, forget about… Tiny amounts, a congressional race in New York, a small number of votes. If you go to New Jersey, if you go to Virginia, if you go to Pennsylvania, if you go to California, look at some of these races, every one of these races was a fraud, missing ballots. And I don’t mean like 1%. I mean like 20%, 25%, they’re trying to rig the election.\nDonald Trump: (09:26)\nThey should make people, if you register, if you want a solicited ballot, that’s where you ask for it. You have to sign papers. You get it because you can’t be there. That’s one thing. When they send 80 million ballots to people, they have no idea where they’re going. Actually, they probably do have a good idea where they’re going, and that’s our problem. They send 80 million ballots out. Where are they going? Who are they sending them to? Are they sending them to certain areas and not other areas? Are they sending them to Democrat areas? These are all controlled by Democrat governors, like your politically motivated governor. So, just to finish on that, look, just to finish on that, he’s a guy that tried to silence us by not having this. And it ended up, our crowd turned out to be a lot bigger than NBC, which is owned by Concast. C-O-N, Concast. C-O-N-C-A-S-T, Concast. It’s really Comcast, but I call it con because it’s a whole con.\nDonald Trump: (10:35)\nI’ll tell you what, in the old days, I think it should still be, news when they broadcast had to be reasonably accurate, right? And they had licensing. Today, they can do whatever the hell they want. It’s fake news, and it’s a disgrace. And you know what, back there, and I’ll tell you, it’s hurting our country. It’s hurting our country. They’re the biggest problem that this country has is the fake news media, worse than the Democrats, because the Democrats are their partners. They play together. Joe Biden spent the last 47 years selling out America, offshoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, depleting our military and sacrificing your children’s future in China. I’ve spent the last four years bringing our jobs back to America, securing our borders, rebuilding our military and standing up to China like never before. Nobody has ever stood up to China like we have stood up to China, and you haven’t seen the last of it.\nCrowd: (11:38)\nUSA, USA, USA, USA!\nDonald Trump: (11:41)\nSleepy Joe Biden, who surrendered, you know where he is now, he’s in his damn basement again. No, he’s in his basement. He’s in his basement. But I can be bad to him because he put the most vicious ad on television that I’ve ever seen. Do you know what I’m talking about? Where I’m standing over the graves of our fallen warriors, our fallen heroes. These are great people, the greatest people there are, and I’m standing over there and they have some sleazebag reporter from a third rate magazine having some source quoting me saying, I won’t even use the term, but saying bad things. And there’s nobody that loves our military, respects it and the people more than me. And they took… And I didn’t even ask. We had 25 people that were witnesses that are on the record already that have said that never took place. It never took place, what they said. And yet pathetic Joe, and he’s a pathetic human being to allow that to happen. Here’s the problem, he doesn’t even know what happened, I don’t think. I think he has no idea, but he’s a pathetic human being to let that happen, where they put an ad like that, where I’m standing over graves. And then they said, “He said this,” with no sources, no nothing. They got nothing. And I have 25 real witnesses with the names, with everything, saying it never happened. And they put an ad like that up, they’re a disgrace. But you know the good part? Now I can be really vicious. I can be really vicious.\nDonald Trump: (13:25)\nAnd we’ll start by saying, we’re going to start by saying that the Democrats are trying to rig this election because it’s the only way they’re going to win. The only way they’re going to win is to rig it. Biden’s surrendered your jobs to China. Look, his son walked away with a billion and a half dollars, give me a break, give me a… His son’s going to say, “Dad, you can’t take this money away. Don’t do it, Dad, please, I don’t…” You know how much experience he had? There’s a young man here, he’s a very young, young man, handsome young guy. He’s about like 12. You know what? He’s got more experience than Hunter. Hunter.\nDonald Trump: (14:07)\nWhere’s Hunter? Where is he? With no experience, no knowledge of energy, no job, got thrown out of the military… You know he got thrown out, by the way. I used to be nice about that. Now I don’t. Once I saw that ad, I don’t have to be nice anymore. Okay, I really mean it. And by the way, on that ad, I know some horrible people, horrible human beings, some of the worst people in the world, I really do, they’re horrible, none of those people, and they’re the worst, the worst, real estate developers in New York, you don’t get much worse. I know some of the worst people in the world, not one person do I know that would say that, standing on top of graves, of heroes, really, not one person. So I will tell you this, so now we can play it like it is. Let’s face it, Joe is shot. Let’s face it, okay? He’s shot. So not that he has anything to do because he won’t know what’s happening. He’ll just be locked up in a room someplace, and the radical left is going to be running our country.\nDonald Trump: (15:14)\nFour more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years!\nDonald Trump: (15:16)\nThank you. But now he wants to surrender our country to the violent left wing mob. You know that. If Biden wins, China wins. If Biden wins, the mob wins. You see what’s going on with all these democratic or I always say Democrat-run cities and states. It’s a disaster. It’s a disaster. And we keep saying, “Let us bring in the troops.” Well, we did it in Minneapolis, we ended it. In 45 minutes, it was ended. They went through two weeks. By the way, we could do it in Portland in half an hour. It would all be over. But we have these stupid people that think… How about that poor mayor? Is that pathetic, Wheeler, is that pathetic? They forced him out of his home. He’s now finding a new home, it’s so nice. It’s pathetic. Honestly, it’s pathetic.\nDonald Trump: (16:08)\nWe could solve that problem in a half an hour, just like we did. And by the way, the US Marshals did a great job in Portland. They did a great job. You know what I mean. If Biden wins, the rioters win, the anarchists win, arsonists, flag burners, they all win. I’m running for reelection to bring prosperity to Nevada, to the whole country. I’ve been here a long time. I have some things in Nevada that are very good to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China. I do get a kick out of watching a guy, “Oh, I’m going to do this.” He copied my whole plan. You see, he says, “Buy America,” I said, “Where the hell have you been for the last half century?”\nCrowd: (16:58)\nWe love Trump, we love Trump, we love Trump, we love Trump, we love Trump!\nDonald Trump: (17:04)\nThank you.\nCrowd: (17:04)\nWe love Trump, we love Trump, we love Trump, we love Trump, we love Trump, we love Trump, we love Trump!\nDonald Trump: (17:15)\nCould I ask the fake news to take your cameras and show all the way back there for hundreds of yards, all the way back there. Take your cameras. Go as far as the eye can see. No, no, tell NBC News it’s not a thousand people. You can’t see it. You can’t see it down here. You won’t believe how many people. That thing goes back…\nCrowd: (17:45)\nUSA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA!\nDonald Trump: (17:59)\nSo the bottom line is when we win, America wins, that’s what’s happening. And nobody’s done to China what I did. Look, billions, tens of billions of dollars of tariffs we took in. I gave $28 billion to farmers. The farmers are doing very well. They’re doing very well. Thank you. Thank you, President Trump. 28 billion. 16 billion one year 12 billion. They were targeted. I said, “How much is it?” Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, great guy, said, “How much were they hurt by?” “Sir, 12 billion two years ago and 16 billion last year.” I said, “All right, good. We’ll take it out of China.” We gave them 28 billion, to the farmers. That never happened before. You think Joe Biden would even think about it? He wouldn’t even think about it. He wouldn’t even think about it. No, he’s more worried about, does he have a teleprompter to answer a reporter’s question.\nDonald Trump: (18:51)\nThe worst part about that isn’t the fact that he’s doing that, because let’s face it, he’s unable, okay? It’s not that, it’s that the fake news would give him the questions. They never gave me the questions. Did you ever give me questions, back there? Did you ever give me… They don’t give me questions. The fake news would give him questions, but of course now Donna Brazile works for Fox, so that’s gone a long way. Remember? Remember when Donna Brazile gave crooked Hillary the questions, right? To a debate? And then she said, “Well, I don’t think I did it. I don’t remember.” I knew she was in trouble when she said, “I don’t remember doing that. I don’t remember.” She didn’t remember. Oh, okay. Well, as long as you don’t remember.\nCrowd: (19:34)\nLock her up, lock her up, lock her up.\nDonald Trump: (19:36)\nIt’s true. It’s true too. It’s true.\nCrowd: (19:38)\nLock her up, lock her up, lock her up, lock her up, lock her up, lock her up.\nDonald Trump: (19:44)\nYou know what, I used to stand back and I’d say, “Be quiet, please. Don’t say that. It’s really not nice.” You know it’s true. She deleted 33… Think of it. They’ll never find the emails because they were acid washed, deleted. But you know what? She got a subpoena from the United States Congress, right? And she and her lawyer deleted 33,000 emails after she got a United States subpoena. And you say, “Why isn’t she guilty of a major crime?” Right? And then she took her telephones and she smashed them with a hammer. Right? And then she took the other ones, and she deleted them. And now the Mueller scam, these people, the worst people. I have a friend, a very smart guy, very streetwise guy. He said, “You have to be the most honest guy in the world to go through three years of investigations, where they have the worst human beings in the world.” They worked for the Democrats. They worked…\nDonald Trump: (20:42)\nI mean, Mueller didn’t have a clue. This guy was totally… But look at this Weissmann, how bad was Weissmann? He deleted his phone. That’s illegal. He deleted everything. They all deleted. And they all said, “Oh gee, we made a mistake. We’re sorry.” They all used the same mistake. They all made… It was, “Oh gee, we didn’t mean to do that.” Every one of them, all of them. I think it was 31 different phones, they deleted. These are criminals we’re dealing with. And they’ve got to… There has to be a repercussion. There has to be a repercussion. We’re dealing with criminals. So I don’t care if you say it anymore because you know what? She illegally deleted, and her lawyers should go to jail with her, okay?\nDonald Trump: (21:25)\nAnd the fact is the Republican party doesn’t play it rough and tough like those people, they don’t play it the same way. They’re too nice. And we have better policy. Thank goodness we have better… We believe in borders. We believe in no sanctuary cities. We believe in lowering taxes. We have better, but our people don’t… We have some that are very good. Jim Jordan, good, right?\nCrowd: (21:51)\nWe love you, Mr. President!\nDonald Trump: (21:53)\nJim Jordan. Mark Meadows, good, right? No, we have some very good, but I’ll tell you what, we play it so nice, and in the end it’s not right because what they get away with… And Obama and Biden got caught spying on our campaign using the intelligence, I put that in quotes, using intelligence to spy on our campaign, and they got caught. They got caught. And if it was me that got caught, forget about it. But they got caught and somebody said, ” Well I know, but he was President.” Oh great, I’m President too. And a hell of a lot better President than he is, I can tell you that. Obama came into office, they gave him the Nobel Prize, like almost immediately, right? In fact, he didn’t even know why he got it. He didn’t even know, he had no idea why he got it. And he was right about that because nobody else does either. They still don’t know, but we’ve done a lot of things. So we were nominated a few days ago for a Nobel Prize, which is a big thing. Nobel Peace Prize.\nDonald Trump: (23:14)\nAnd then yesterday we were nominated a second time for another Nobel Prize. Now, that’s a big thing. To me, it’s a big thing, even though obviously it’s a very political thing, but it’s a very big thing. The Nobel Peace Prize, right? I got, it was just reported. I’m just reporting this, I got zero time on the nightly news, on the network news. Zero, zero. We got zero time. Think of it, the President of your country is honored by being nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, and your nightly news, ABC, which is terrible, CBS, which is terrible, and probably the worst of all owned by Concast, they spend a fortune on PR, and then every time I get up, I call them Concast and sort of wipe out their fortune. But they are bad people. But NBC is the worst of them all, not one mentioned. These people are corrupt. Not one mentioned, not one mentioned.\nDonald Trump: (24:20)\nSo your President gets a Nobel and, at least a nomination, and they don’t mention it. Joe Biden cannot lead our country because he doesn’t really believe in our country. Right now, I don’t think he believes in anything, he just wants to go to sleep. That’s all. “Please, darling, I want to go to bed. I’m exhausted. I made one speech yesterday.” “But darling, they gave you the answers and the questions.” “I know, but that was a big strain because my eyes, I couldn’t see the teleprompter.” This guy is the worst. I am… And you know, it’s going to maybe come back to haunt me because we have a rigged election. It’s a rigged election. It’s the only way we’re going to lose, but I’ll tell you what, he is the worst candidate in the history of Presidential…\nDonald Trump: (25:03)\nHe is the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. He doesn’t know he’s alive. He doesn’t know he’s alive. And I got to know President Xi of China very well, President Putin of Russia, Kim Jong-un. By the way, what happened to the war? I thought we was going to war with Kim Jong-un. Where’s the war? Where’s the war? Oh, I see. Oh, I see. It never happened, did it? Never happened, did it?\nDonald Trump: (25:27)\nWell, maybe some day, could happen. No, remember? “Trump is going to be … ” You know my personality, right? “Trump is going to be a war at within the first week after he wins.” Where’s the war.?In fact, the peace prize was because I stayed out of wars, and by the way, ended certain Wars that could have happened that you don’t even know about. And look what we did just yesterday in Europe, and look what we did with Israel, and you just saw that, with United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain.\nDonald Trump: (26:04)\nFor 72 years, nothing happened, and we did it. We do it very fast. And plenty of other countries are going to be coming in. At Biden’s convention, they decried it. You’re a hell of a crowd. I’ll tell you. You’re [inaudible 00:26:15].\nAudience: (26:15)\n[crosstalk 00:01:17]-\nDonald Trump: (26:42)\nThank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Now, after this is over, you’ll have like at NBC, this third-rate reporter stand up. They had a small crowd, a insignificant crowd, in a great location. You know how great it was? We landed, we had to drive for 50 minutes. That’s how great. But I like it anyway. I’ll take it. I’ll take it anyway. I like it. You’re my kind of people. We love each other. I like it.\nDonald Trump: (27:22)\nWe landed the big, beautiful Air Force One. I just asked as we’re coming in, “Why couldn’t we have landed here?” I would have rather, then I could have had the plane right behind me. Instead, we have the beast. See the beast. What you don’t know is the beast costs almost as much as the plane. It’s a hell of a car. It’s a walking army tank, the beast. But we could have. I said, “Why don’t we just land here?” And we couldn’t. So I get off the plane. Oh, good. “How long will it be?” “About 50 minutes.” That’s a long drive. And driving here, there were tens of thousands of people on the streets with flags.\nDonald Trump: (28:12)\nAnd then you read these fake reporters and they say, “President Trump is tied in Nevada, tied.” I don’t think so. The only way we’re tied is if they screw around with the ballots, which they will do in my opinion. Okay? We’re not tied anywhere. I asked some people that traveled with Obama. I said, “Was it the same thing?” They say, “Not even a tiny fraction of what you have.” There’s not even a fraction. We have more enthusiasm. We have more spirit than any campaign that anybody’s ever seen. It’s true.\nDonald Trump: (28:53)\nAnd that includes 2016, where the enthusiasm obviously was great. How about all those states that we weren’t supposed to win? “No, he won’t win there. He won’t win there.” Then all night long, “Donald Trump won the great state of Texas. Donald Trump won the great state of … ” this and that, and one after another. Was that one of the coolest things, watching their people go crazy? They went crazy. No, they went crazy.\nDonald Trump: (29:24)\nHow is he going to do in Georgia? Well, I think George is going to be very close. It’s going to be very close. They go, “The polls in Georgia have closed. Donald Trump wins the state of Georgia.” You know why? Because we won by so much, that they can do it simultaneously by saying, “The polls closed, and he won.” We had many of them. Right? And by the way, we’re doing great. I just had … Florida is a biggie, a good one. And we are winning in Florida by a lot, so that’s good. A lot.\nDonald Trump: (29:47)\nI’ll tell you here, because you don’t read about that stuff. They don’t like to write that. They don’t like to write it. They have all fake polls. I’ll tell you what, the polls are worse than the writing. Actually, in my opinion, the polls, they’re suppression polls, they’re meant to make people discouraged, Even me, I’m supposed to be discouraged. And fortunately, four years ago, we weren’t discouraged, because if we would have believed the polls, nobody would have voted.\nDonald Trump: (30:14)\nThe concept is really make people feel so that on election, they go, “Darling, let’s go out to dinner. It’s so sad about the president. I wish he was going to win, but let’s go out to dinner. Then we’ll come home. Let’s not bother voting, right? Let’s not bother voting.” See, it’s a suppression, but my people might don’t get suppressed. My people go out and vote.\nDonald Trump: (30:35)\nMy people go out and vote. There’s no suppression. Phony polls. How about the guy? The New York times hired this pollster, this great genius. He never called one wrong. I don’t know. Three, 46.. I don’t know what the hell … It’s called three 40 … What’s his deal?\nSpeaker 1: (30:51)\nSilver.\nDonald Trump: (30:52)\nYeah. It’s Silver, Silver, Nate Silver. They pay him a fortune. He said, I think he gave us a 2% chance, A 3% chance, “Donald Trump has a 3% chance today of winning.” The damn thing was over by 10:00.\nDonald Trump: (31:11)\nWe were given a very tiny chance. What chance did he give us? Like 9%, something like that. You know, they gave him millions of dollars shortly before, because he never called one wrong. He called that one wrong. He called that one wrong. And this is the one … I mean, I must tell you they’re a little more accurate. At least here they have us even in a lot of places. ” He’s even.” Well, we’re not even, we’re not even.\nDonald Trump: (31:33)\nThis is going to be the greatest victory. This is a more important election than four years ago, I’ll tell you, more important. Because at no time before, has there been a clearer choice between two parties or two visions, two philosophies, two agendas for the future. There’s never been anything like this. On November 3rd, Nevada will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity, like we had.\nDonald Trump: (32:02)\nWe had the greatest economy in the history … not of our country, in the world. We were beating everybody. We were beating China. Remember, if you go back, some of you go back, if you go back 10 years, 15 years, five years, everything was … In 2019, China will overtake the United States as the largest economy. And that didn’t work out too well for them. That didn’t work out. We were just doing leaps and bounds. We were doing so great, and then we got hit with the plague, the China plague. And we’re not thrilled. It’s a disgrace. Nobody should have died. Nobody should have died. We got hit. The whole world got hit, but they stopped it from going into the rest of China. They stopped it from going into China, but they didn’t stop it from coming into the US and Europe and 188 countries.\nDonald Trump: (32:57)\nSo whether or not we allow Biden to impose the biggest tax increase in the history of our country, $4 trillion, or ban … He wants to ban energy, ban American … He wants to stop fracking. Hey, by the way, when he was running as a Democrat, in the worst debate performances I’ve ever seen. Okay? What do you think … He was unable to answer anything. Are you awake, sir? Sir, please wake up. And who was the worst? Who treated him the worst? Kamala. Kamala.\nDonald Trump: (33:29)\nShe’s another beauty. She started off as a favorite. She was at 15. Then she went down to 14, to 12, to 10. She was like a dropping rock in water. She was going down so fast. Then she went down to five and four and three, two, and then she said, “I got to get the hell out of here. This is getting embarrassing.”\nDonald Trump: (33:50)\nAnd nobody treated him worse than Kamala. Right? She called him a racist. She called him everything. She was horrible to him. And he says, “She was Kamala. She’s just great.” Oh, yeah. These people, these people. You’re supposed to choose the people that did well. She got out before Iowa, as I remember. Right? She didn’t want to run in Iowa, and then Bernie got … Again, this guy is the greatest loser ever because-\nAudience: (34:15)\n[crosstalk 00:34:15]-\nDonald Trump: (34:15)\nNo, no. No, he’s a good sport, Bernie, crazy Bernie. He’s so crazy, but he’s a good sport, because with Hillary, they really did.\nDonald Trump: (34:26)\nDo we have any young children here? I know it’s on a lot of television. Could you turn the television off just for a minute, just for about three seconds? He got screwed. Right? Okay. Now you can turn it back on. But then they really did with this last one, because if Pocahontas, Elizabeth Warren, if she would have left the race one day before the big Super Tuesday, I mean, Bernie would have her philosophy, right? Liberals.\nDonald Trump: (34:56)\nBy the way, you know who’s more liberal than Bernie? Kamala. She’s rated the number one most liberal … This is not for Nevada. This is not for [inaudible 00:35:04]. And I would say, she’ll be president. If he ever wants, she’ll be president within the first month or so, I would say. I think it’s just an excuse. Using him as just an excuse to get the super libs in there, so they can destroy our suburbs, demolish our Second Amendment, erase your borders and indoctrinate your children with poisonous, anti-American lies in school. So under my leadership, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And now we’re doing it again. We’re doing it again. You’ve seen the numbers. And we’re developing a vaccine in record time. It will be ready before the end of the year and maybe much sooner than that. They’re very unhappy about that. It’s amazing.\nDonald Trump: (35:56)\nWe have a couple of really great experts, one who’s … We call him Dr. Scott. You know who I’m talking about? He’s great. He said, this is the only time … They were grilling him on television, saying, “Well, the vaccine’s going too fast.” You know why that’s too fast? Because they don’t want it to happen before the election. He said, “This is the only thing in the world. I’ve never seen anything like it. Everybody wants a vaccine. And when we start getting it fast, because President Trump happens to be president … ” and we’ve done this in record time, years ahead of schedule. If this was Sleepy Joe and Obama, you wouldn’t have a vaccine for three years. But listen, he said, “This is the craziest thing.”\nDonald Trump: (36:32)\nSo you’re going to have a vaccine quickly. Right? And everybody’s upset about it. So now they’re trying to hurt the vaccine. And they’re trying to say as many bad … They know nothing about it, but they’re trying to hurt it, and it’s a shame. But he said it better than anybody I’ve heard. He said, “You’re trying to hurt this country by saying bad things about the vaccine, because we’re going to produce it early.” It’s the craziest thing. Think about it. Now, having a vaccine is good, but we’re rounding the turn regardless. We’re rounding the turn, and it’s happening. I mean, it’s happening. You see. Florida is way down. Texas is now way down. Arizona, governor’s done a great job. All three governors have done a great job. And Louisiana now, they had a spike, but they had the spike, but the spike was able to be handled, because now we understand. And what we did, we saved millions of lives, because I hated to do it, but we had to close it up, understand this disease, and then open up again.\nDonald Trump: (37:33)\nAnd we opened, but we would have had 2 million, two and a half, or three million people. Think of it. We’re at like around 180,000. One is too many. One, too many. But we would’ve had two and a half, three, three and a half million people. It would not have been acceptable, would not have been sustainable. We’ve done an incredible job. And these people that have done it with me, the ventilators, the vaccines, the therapeutics, these people … I mean the hospitals, the beds that we built, the ships that we sent to New York, the ships that we sent. To have an ungrateful governor in New York, Cuomo, to have an ungrateful governor. We sent him ships. We sent them ships. We sent them.\nDonald Trump: (38:19)\nWe built a convention center with 2,800 beds, and he didn’t use the beds for senior citizens. He hardly used the beds at all. He hardly used the ships at all. He said we did a phenomenal job, and now he gets political. He wants to get political with me. A real wise guy, but that’s okay. You got to see what they are doing between him and de Blasio. That’s a beauty. What they’ve done to my beautiful city. I love that city so much. What they’ve done is so horrible. The highest taxes in the land, crime all over the place. They’re like 300% up in crime. We need Rudy to come out of retirement. But we’re defeating the China virus. When Biden was vice president, he was a complete disaster on the swine flu, which was a much easier thing to handle. Joe Biden’s own chief of staff said that when Biden managed swine flu in 2009, they quote, “Did every possible thing wrong.” This is the guy that worked for him in charge of the swine flu. And 60 million Americans got H1N1 in a period of time. And it’s just purely a … He said it was just … we were lucky. He said, “It’s just lucky that there weren’t great mass casualties.” Different kinds of a disease, a little bit.\nDonald Trump: (39:37)\nAnd what he said is amazing. He said we did nothing right. This is the man that’s going to tell us all about building ventilators. You think Joe is going to be able to build thousands of ventilators a month? Which now we’re doing, and sending them to all these countries, all over the world, who have no hope of building ventilators, and they need them badly.\nSpeaker 2: (39:58)\nThank you [inaudible 00:14:58].\nDonald Trump: (40:00)\nSo it’s an amazing thing. The outbreak was so rampant that Obama-Biden, the administration, told States to stop testing immediately, and they ordered the CDC to stop counting cases because they looked like hell, okay? We didn’t do that. By the way, the reason we show so many cases, because we have the best testing program in the world, by far, by far.\nDonald Trump: (40:26)\nWe’ve tested more people than India, than many, many big countries put together. India’s second. We’re 44 million tests ahead of India. They have 1.5 billion people, and Prime Minister Modi calls me. He says, “What a job you’ve done with testing.” I said, “Explain that to these dishonest people back [inaudible 00:15:45].”\nDonald Trump: (40:47)\nBiden’s record demonstrates that if he had been in charge when the China virus arrived, hundreds of thousands of more Americans would have died. As vice president, he presided over the worst and the weakest and the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. You’ve heard that before. It was the most pathetic recovery since the Depression. No state was hit harder by Biden’s failure than Nevada. And I was out here and that right about that. You got hit hard. This is not the guy you want.\nDonald Trump: (41:20)\nBut under my administration, before the virus, we quickly achieved the lowest unemployment rate in the history of Nevada. And we’ll soon have it back there again. We’ll soon have it back there again, but I hope everybody here, 25,000 people, whatever the hell it is, including those people back there, they’re angry at me. I don’t know why we gave the press this good location, because … No, it blocks the people … thousands of people back there, and the press is blocking them. And I consider them much more important than I do the press. [inaudible 00:41:53].\nDonald Trump: (41:59)\nBut Biden wants to raise your taxes so high. He would eradicate your economy. He’d put on new regulations, and it wouldn’t be him again. I’m going to keep saying it. It will be the people that control him. He’s a puppet. And then he wants to do a complete shutdown. We’re setting records. We just set a job record for four months, 10.4 million people.\nDonald Trump: (42:21)\nListen to this. So when we had this pandemic worldwide, look, it’s a terrible thing that a thing like this happened. People were saying we could go to 41, 42% unemployment. You know what we are now? 8.4%. I don’t say that’s …\nDonald Trump: (42:38)\nIf you would have said that … And we have the strongest, highest stock market in history, so your 401ks are doing great. If he got in, we would have the greatest depression in the history of our country. I mean it. I think 1929 would look like good times. All right? Because he’d do everything wrong. He’d raise your taxes. He’d raised the hell out of interest rates. He’d do everything wrong. The Biden shutdown will permanently destroy the lives and dreams of tens of millions of Americans, inflict totally lasting harm on our children and lead countless deaths from suicide. Don’t forget when you do these shutdowns, your state is shut down.\nDonald Trump: (43:19)\nYou got a governor. You shut down, except if you have a riot. You’re not shut down for riots. Riots, you can have, they can burn the hell out of the Strip. They can burn the hell out of Reno. They can do whatever the hell they want if it’s a riot. But if you want to go to church, you can’t do it. If you want to be in a group of people, you can’t do it. But there’s a lot of harm done on the other side. There’s a lot of tremendous harm done. Remember, the cure can’t be worse. Remember that.\nDonald Trump: (43:51)\nAnd on the other side, drugs, suicide, depression, substance abuse of different kinds, heart disease. You have tremendous problems on the other side. Open your schools, open up. We got to open up this state. And I guarantee you …\nDonald Trump: (44:13)\nAnd by the way, the states that are open are doing really well. They’re doing much better than the ones that are closed. I don’t know if you’ve been seeing the numbers. And this is just arithmetic. The states that are open are doing great. The states that are closed, North Carolina, what he’s doing to that great state, he’s got it locked down, shut down. Michigan, what she’s doing. And we’re trying to get Big 10 football by the way, but we won’t even. Michigan, what she’s doing to Michigan is unbelievable.\nDonald Trump: (44:41)\nTake a look at what they’re doing to Pennsylvania. And here’s another governor in charge of millions of ballots. So I’m going to win Pennsylvania, but what’s he going to do with these ballots? Where are they going? Who are they sending? Who’s sending it back? Who’s signing? They don’t even have to have an authorized signature in Nevada. Do you know that? They don’t have to have …\nDonald Trump: (45:01)\nYou don’t have to have an authorized signature on a ballot? No. They’re trying to rig an election, and we can’t let that happen. I hope you’re all going to be poll-watchers, I hope you are, because with you people watching the polls, it’s going to be pretty hard to cheat. I’ll tell you, I wouldn’t want to be a cheater. They’ll figure a way. No, they are. It’s a very dangerous thing.\nDonald Trump: (45:23)\nIt’s a very dangerous thing, and I totally mean it. And I’ve been at it. And you see people. And by the way, it’s not even politics. It’s common sense. They said millions of ballots. People are getting ballots. People died and they’re getting ballots. They’re sending them to dogs. You see that? Dogs got ballot. Everybody’s getting ballots. Probably everybody, but Republican are going to get the ballots. Right? And they’re unsolicited. So when you say, solicited, because I like solicited better as a word than absentee. Absentee, nobody knows what the hell it’s supposed to represent. It’s not really a good definition. One is solicited, where you ask … You solicit the ballot.\nDonald Trump: (46:00)\nYou want it, you sign papers. They send it to you. You send it back. It’s okay. It’s good. But unsolicited, where they take millions of ballots. So what happens? I happen to think the postal people are great, but what happens if one of the post guys, before he gives the ballots, he takes a whole handful and hands them to some Democrat political operative, right?\nDonald Trump: (46:21)\nAnd so, he hands him a thousand ballots, and the guy doesn’t even have to … you don’t have to have verification to do that. Now, here’s the good news. We’re in front of a court. And hopefully, the court’s going to rule, because this is the greatest scam in the history of presidential politics. These people are … they’ve gone crazy.\nDonald Trump: (46:42)\nBiden and his party of liberal hypocrites want to lock law-abiding Americans in their homes, which is what they’re doing. And they want to keep them out of church. They really do. They’re fighting God, they’re fighting guns, and they’re fighting oil. Think of it. I don’t think they’ll do too well in Texas. Did you see where they said? “We think the race will be quite close in Texas, but the president has an edge.” Listen, I’m in favor of oil and energy. I’m in favor of religion and God. Okay? And I’m in favor of our great Second Amendment, guns.\nDonald Trump: (47:25)\nSo he’s against our Second Amendment. Okay, you know who he’d put in charge. Beto, Beto. Or as he says is, “Beto, Beto.” So when Beto was legit and then Ted Cruz beat him, and Ted did a very good job. I tell you, he did a great job. But Beto went totally south. He’s gone crazy. So he now is a big gun guy. He wants to take guns away from everybody. So who did Biden put in charge? Beto.\nDonald Trump: (47:54)\nRemember Beto was interviewed in some magazine or third-rate magazine, most of them are, but remember? And Beto said, this was at the beginning before he got beat to hell. I said, “He thought this was easy, didn’t he?”\nDonald Trump: (48:07)\nBut remember when Beto said, “I was born for this.” As soon as I hear somebody’s born for running for president, I said, “He’s out. That’s the end of him.” Nobody’s born for this. This is tough stuff. I had a great life, I’ll tell you. My life was so beautiful. What the hell did I do this for? But you know what? You know what? We are doing things that nobody’s ever done before.\nDonald Trump: (48:34)\nAnd I say it all the time, and that’s what makes me happy. We’re dealing with very sick and very bad and evil people. But I’ll tell you no administration in three-and-a-half years, no administration has done what we’ve done in the first three-and-a-half years. But they want to punish you for praying in church while they let agitators and arsonists burn your churches down.\nDonald Trump: (49:01)\nLook at Washington. They want to burn the churches down, and that’s fine. But you want to go pray in church, they won’t let you do that. Just last week, Biden proudly accepted the endorsement of pro-criminal, anti-police, Portland district attorney, who has a policy of releasing rioters, vandals, criminals, and violent extremists without any charges. No charges. Never saw anything.\nDonald Trump: (49:26)\nBy the way, all of these places were talking about are Democrat- run, Chicago, New York, Portland, Seattle. The only reason Seattle got settled, because they knew we were going in. We told them, “we’re going in tomorrow morning. We’re going to open it up. We’re going to take it.” It would have taken us 20 minutes. So they sent people that night, because they didn’t want to be embarrassed. But look at what we’ve done. And so, every place we’ve touched, we solved the crime, but they have to ask us. If they don’t ask us, we’re not supposed to do it, but maybe we do it anyway. And it usually takes anywhere from 25 minutes to …\nDonald Trump: (50:03)\nAnd it usually takes anywhere from 25 minutes to about one hour. Wasn’t that a beautiful sight though in Minneapolis, right? They’re burning the poor city down. I love that state. I think we have a chance of winning in that state, first time in many years for a Republican. They’re burning Minneapolis. You don’t think of Minneapolis that way, right? You don’t think of it. The city is burning down. You have this fake CNN reporter, what’s his name? Velshi, the nice shaved head. Maybe I should try that, should I try that? No, I don’t think … ” Donald Trump went down substantially in the polls, like about 40%. He showed up with a new haircut, it’s called the shave head.” Ali Velshi. And remember he said, “No, this is a friendly protest. It’s a friendly protest. And it’s really quite nice.” And people are throwing bottles at him, he’s being hit with tear gas. This is a friendly protest. And you look over his shoulder and the entire city was burning.\nDonald Trump: (50:55)\nDo you remember the scene? The thing looked like it was 30 blocks, it was just burning. And he’s talking about, this is all fake news and nobody would have known. I knew it before I did it, but I never knew it to this extent. I never knew it to this extent. It is corrupt. It’s fake and they shouldn’t be allowed to do it. They shouldn’t be allowed. These are far left lunatics that Biden selects to staff his government. There are policies Biden’s pledged to apply nationwide. You’re going to have the suburbs, they have a plan. It doesn’t matter, it’s a regulation, very horrible regulation for the … Does anybody live in the suburbs? Because if you don’t vote for Trump in the suburbs, okay.\nSpeaker 3: (51:38)\n[inaudible 00:51:38] Valley loves you!\nDonald Trump: (51:42)\nWomen that live in the suburbs. They say, “Oh, they don’t like Donald Trump.” I said, “I think they do.” Remember last time, remember it’s the same thing. No, it’s the same thing. Remember, last time, four years ago, “Donald Trump will not do well with women.” I said, “Why am I so bad? Donald Trump will not …” And then the votes started coming in. “He’s doing very well, Jim, with women, I don’t know what’s going on.” We did very well with women. We did well with everybody, we did well with everybody. But they have a regulation. And Ben Carson was fantastic, the head of HUD. I said, “Ben, they’re going to destroy the suburbs.” And they wanted Corey Booker to head that program. But the program was already doing damage. They were playing with the zoning so they could build projects in the suburb, projects in the suburbs. And I said, “We’re going to end it.” Somebody said, “Sir, let’s just amend it.” I said, “Nope, we got to end it. End it, I want to end it. I don’t want to have a lesser version.”\nDonald Trump: (52:46)\nBut if he gets in, they will open up that whole program. They’re going to open it up on steroids. They’re going to open it up to a level that you wouldn’t have believed possible. And he will drive you out of the suburbs. He will drive you out of the … he’ll drive you out of everything. They’re open up their … I call it the suburban destruction program because that’s what they’ve done. And it’s been a horrible program. It’s been very unfair to people with the American dream. And let me just tell you something. 30% of the people that live in the suburbs are minorities. They’re Hispanic, they’re Black, they’re Asian, it’s the American dream. And they want the American dream and they don’t want that to happen. That’s why I’m doing so well with African American, with Asian American, with Hispanic American and with women. But don’t let them ruin the suburbs because they will put that regulation back immediately, immediately. And don’t let them ruin the suburbs because the suburbs are a special place. The suburbs are the American dream.\nDonald Trump: (53:51)\nThat’s where everyone aspires to and that includes minorities and everybody. Don’t let them ruin the suburbs. And with that comes tremendous crime. And I was talking the other day, “Darling, somebody just moved next door. Who is it? It’s a representative of Antifa.” She will look at her husband, say, “Darling, we’re out of here. We’re out of here.” Antifa. Remember they were trying to blame other people. They don’t like to mention the name Antifa. I said, it’s Antifa and I was right. I was right. They’re bad people. And you know what, they have to pay a price for the damage and for the horror that they’ve caused, they have to pay a price. And it’s so easy. It’s so easy. A lot of them now are wealthy. They’re like these wealthy, spoiled kids that have no clue about life.\nDonald Trump: (54:44)\nThey’ve got arms that are about this big but they were heavy jackets with lots … and you look and you say, “Oh, that guy looks tough.” And then the jacket comes off and you see these two little … And they go home and they live in a basement too, their mom and dad’s basement. But Biden’s plan is to appease domestic terrorists and my plan is to arrest domestic terrorists. Joe Biden is a weak person. He does whatever his left wing, puppet masters demand, you know that. Look, Joe doesn’t know what’s going on, you know that. I mean, let’s be nice about it, okay. And I’m being nice when I say it. He’ll never be able to protect your family, your loved ones or your community. If Biden’s elected his radical supporters won’t just cause mayhem on the streets like you’re seeing, all Democrats. We could solve it so fast. Chicago, a few weekends, think of it, 72 people shot, this is shot. Somebody said, “You mean with bullets?” I said, “Yeah, with bullets.” 18 people died. Now we’re pulling our troops out of Afghanistan, out of Iraq, you see what’s happening.\nDonald Trump: (55:56)\nBut let me tell you but we don’t … there’s nothing like that over there. They don’t have 18 people killed or 12 people in a short period of time. Well, you have 70 people shot, where you have another weekend where they had, I think a few weekends ago, 38 people have been shot in Chicago. I said, 38? It’s not even believable. And now when these people say it, they make it … they try and play it down. And you’re sitting there, I said, “Did I just see 38 people were shot?” It’s just a terrible thing. And it could all be stopped. It could all be stopped so quickly. But they have to respect law and they have to have order. Law and order.\nDonald Trump: (56:37)\nBut these radical lefts will be running the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security and the United States Supreme Court. And you see what’s going on there. If we don’t … The next president, hopefully it’s going to be us, not me, us, but the next president is going to have one, two, three or four Supreme Court justice. It’s just, you know, just that time, right? Just that time, going to be a minimum of one, I would say, but it will be a one, two, three or four. And that’s going to change the whole makeup of the Supreme Court. That’s going to take away your guns. That’s going to destroy your second amendment. That’s going to change the whole rationale thinking on so many different subjects like you wouldn’t believe, including by the way, life, okay. Life, pro-life, anybody pro-life here? No, this is going to change the makeup of this country for 50 years. I don’t know that the country will survive 50 years, if that happens, it might not survive five years if that happens. But the next president and you saw, I put out a list of an additional number of very conservative, highly thought of, highly respected judges. And they are the only people that I will pick. Meaning the first list, the second list, it’s about 44, 45 people. They are the only people that I will consider for the Supreme Court of the United States. And I’m asking Joe Biden to do the same thing, but he can’t because he’s got a bunch of radical left maniacs that they want to put on the court. And nobody can get elected, not even with Democrats, rational Democrats, will they vote for some of these people to be on.\nDonald Trump: (58:24)\nSo far he’s refused to do it. I’m probably forcing him tonight to do something, but he should put out a list of his judges so that you know where you stand. Biden supports cutting police funding, you know that, abolishing … and by the way, did you see, we just got Chicago police today endorsed Trump. That’s not easy to do. Chicago. New York’s finest, New York’s finest endorse, Florida, Ohio, Texas. We have everybody. Is there a police officer in the country, if there is, they’ll do a commercial. This officer loves sleepy Joe Biden, he’s so tough on crime. So Biden’s been going down very rapidly in the polls. And now what he’s doing is he’s playing tough guy, that he’s tough on crime. And all of a sudden, he goes from demolished, demolish and defund, okay? But he goes from, let’s not give the police any money. Let’s not even say defund for him. His people want to defund the police. They actually have places, Seattle, they actually don’t want to have police. Minneapolis, they don’t want to have police. They don’t want to have police. What’s going to happen?\nDonald Trump: (59:37)\nYou saw the commercial we put up. A woman’s being murdered. “I’m sorry. We cannot take your call right now. We will call you back within the next 24 hours.” A woman’s being raped, right? “I’m sorry. We could not respond right now because we have been defunded, but we will try getting there within the next week.” This is what you’re going to have. I mean, that was a strong commercial. It had a big impact, but this is what you’re buying with a guy like this. This guy you’re going to have Portland’s all over this country. And we can’t allow that to happen. “Not here,” he says, “Not here in Nevada.” Well with your governor, it could happen here too, I can tell. They want to abolish bail. So they want to abolish cash bail like they did in New York. They release people, the horrible criminals in New York, they release them, no cash bail. And he calls law enforcement, Biden called law enforcement the enemy. They’re not the enemy. They’re our friends. They’re our great friends.\nDonald Trump: (01:00:39)\nAnd without them, we wouldn’t be here. Here in Nevada rioters burned the city hall in Reno. Does anybody know that? Do you know that? That’s not a pleasant sight. How did you allow that to happen? I would’ve thought you people would’ve gotten out there, like, “You’re not going to burn our city hall.” And during the violent demonstrations in Las Vegas a 29- year-old police officer, you know about this, was deliberately shot in the head while he was doing his job, a vicious criminal left, he was a left person, a left. He was a real left, all right. And the, the young officer as you know, he’s a young, brilliant, young guy and he’s totally paralyzed. Unlike Biden, while I’m President of the United States, I will always stand with the heroes of our law enforcement. And on November 3rd, you will save America. You’re talking about saving America. We cannot let this happen to our country. Because I don’t know if you can ever come back from what will happen, including our Supreme Court.\nDonald Trump: (01:01:44)\nWe’re joined tonight by our terrific Republican congressional nominee, who has my complete and total endorsement. Jim, where you Jim? Jim Marchant, Jim Marchant, where are you? A lot of people out there, Jim, it’s not easy. Are you doing well? I just looked at a very solid poll. Jim Marchant is a great guy and hopefully he’s going to win and you’re going to carry them over and you need it, you need it. Thank you, Jim. And also to a man that should have been governor. He should have been governor, what happened? I don’t know what happened. Nevada Attorney General, he’s a great guy, Adam Laxalt. And he’s watching very closely. And I’ll tell you, Adam, please, he’s a great lawyer, a great talent. And he’s going places but you have to watch. He just said, our next governor. I believe that’s true. You have my endorsement, but I will tell you this, Adam, if you could, because you’re doing a fantastic job watching, watch all these votes coming in on the ballots, the unsolicited ballots. Will you watch it, please? Okay, all right.\nDonald Trump: (01:03:02)\nAll right, James Settelmeyer. Where’s James? James, look at James, whoa. Look at the size of James, I want you protecting me, James. James is good. You’re doing well, I saw a good poll for you too. I think we’re all doing well. I think we’re all doing well, it’s like a family. Thank you James very much. All of you guys, thank you very much. A woman who did a fantastic job, she headed up Michigan. We won Michigan, the first time in decades, Republicans won. She was horrendous, she kept calling me, “Sir, one more speech, please come over. Okay, I’ll do one more, Ronna, Ronna McDaniel. I’ll do one more, Ronna, one more.” I do the speech, two days later, I get a call. “One more, sir. We need one more.” But we ended up winning Michigan, first time in decades. Ronna McDaniel, Ronna. She was great.\nDonald Trump: (01:03:52)\nAnd I said when I won, I said, “Well, who are we going to put at the RNC?” That’s Republican National Committee, who we’re going to put? And I said, ” How about that woman that ran …” She was so tough. I said, “How about the woman that ran Michigan that we won, first time in so many years?” So thank you, Ronna, great job you’re doing, we appreciate it. And another man is doing a fantastic job, who’s been a friend of mine for a long time, your GOP chair, Michael McDonald. Michael, great job, Michael. Thank you, Michael. Thank you, Mike. How are we doing, Michael? Are we leading, I hope? Okay. I hear we’re doing well. Be careful of the ballots, that’s the only way we’re going to lose. Can’t have this happen to our country.\nDonald Trump: (01:04:45)\nAnd also here are several really great members of a terrific association and they like Trump a lot, the Nevada Trucking Association. Where are they, Nevada Trucking? Nevada Trucking, thank you, thank you. Thank you, fellas, thank you very much. Great job, we appreciate it very much. Those roads are going to get very nice. They’re already starting. Tonight our hearts are with all of the communities in the West battling devastating wildfires. I’m going there the day after tomorrow. I’m staying in your state tonight, but I’m going to be going to California. Spoke to the folks in Oregon, Washington, they never had anything like this, but it is about forest management. Please remember the words, very simple, forest management, please remember. It’s about forest management and other things but forest management.\nDonald Trump: (01:05:41)\nMy administration is closely coordinating with state and local leaders and we want to thank the more than 200,000 people that are working on it and 28,000 firefighters and first responders who courageously and bravely are fighting out there. They are fighting and it’s dangerous, it’s dangerous. It’s rapidly spreading, hundreds of thousands of acres, it’s not been anything quite like this one. We spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage Joe Biden inflicted over the past 47 years. Think of it, he’s been there 47 years. And he always says, “Well, why didn’t you do this? Why did …” The guy just really in all fairness, I’ve been here three and a half years. So it’s not like they haven’t been here. He was a vice president for eight years and he only did one thing good. He treated Obama good. I was going to say something else, but they would have scolded me.\nSpeaker 4: (01:06:33)\nKissed his ass.\nDonald Trump: (01:06:35)\nThat’s exactly what I was going to say, but I didn’t. It’s better than you say it. Do you want to shout it out? Go ahead, shout.\nSpeaker 4: (01:06:42)\nHe kissed his ass.\nDonald Trump: (01:06:43)\nThat’s what I said, that’s what I was … thank you very … This can only happen in Nevada. And we pass record tax cuts and regulation cuts to keep the family farms and ranches in the family. Nobody even knows this. We virtually eliminated the unfair estate tax, also known as the death tax. Does anyone have a small farm, medium-sized farm or business? Anybody? If you want to leave it to your children, you don’t have to pay tax now because of Trump. I always say it and I mean it, if you like your children, it’s great. If you don’t like your children, it doesn’t mean a damn thing, don’t leave it to them. I ended the administrations … and if you look at that last administration, what they were doing on American energy, what they were doing, and now we are the world’s number one energy producer by far and we are energy independent.\nDonald Trump: (01:07:41)\nHow about your gas prices? That’s not too bad, right? You didn’t think you’d ever see those prices, those under two dollar prices, did you? Thank you President Trump, I appreciate it, sir. Biden has pledged to abolish the production of American oil and shale and clean coal and natural gas, and he wants to ban fracking, right? So he’s in these debates with the other people and they’re just eating him alive. He did his best debate against crazy Bernie and I got to ask, why did he get better, all of a sudden? What happened? Why, do you have any idea why? I think I know. Why did he get better all of a sudden? But he did his last event, but he was so bad. And he raised his hand, no fracking. “There will be no fracking under my administration,” he said. And you know why I add the word, he said, because they will take what I said and they will put it as a commercial. There will be no fracking under my administration, they’ll have me saying that. That’s how dishonest these people are.\nDonald Trump: (01:08:38)\nSo I always have to add something because … but even then sometimes they’ll cut it off at the end. But he said, there’ll be no fracking under my administration. Now, all of a sudden he goes to Pennsylvania and his polls aren’t looking very good because they do big fracking. And he goes to Texas and he goes to Oklahoma and he goes to North Dakota and he goes to all these places. It’s not looking so good. All of a sudden he says, “I have nothing against fracking. What are you talking about?” But always follow their first instinct because the first instinct is what is going to happen. And he has to, because he signed … he has a manifesto. I call it the manifesto with Bernie and AOC plus three, all these crazy people. And it’s a manifesto and it reads far worse than anything Bernie Sanders ever said. I thought he’d take what Bernie did and move them somewhat to the right. No, he took what Bernie said and they moved way further left. It’s the craziest thing I’ve ever seen. But follow the original statements because that’s what’s going to happen.\nDonald Trump: (01:09:38)\nWhether it’s on religion or on guns or on fracking or on energy or anything, that’s what’s going to happen. California has already implemented this extreme agenda and they are experiencing massive blackouts, you know that, California. They like wind, they like wind. “Oh, darling, let’s watch television. I’m sorry, darling. The wind, the wind isn’t blowing tonight we can’t watch television. But I want to watch President Trump, he’s on television. I want to watch him. Darling, how many times do I have to tell you? The wind is not blowing tonight.” And the government came and turned off all the windmills because they’re killing all our bald eagles and all our birds. It’s unbelievable. You want to see a bird cemetery walk under a windmill sometime. They pile up. Honestly, it’s terrible. Then the environmentalists will say, oh, that’s so wonderful. You know what, when they talk about fumes, when they talk about going up, the carbon, going up, take a look where they’re made. They’re made in China and they’re made in Germany. They spew more crap into the air than anything. You can run those things for 15 years and they’ll never make up the difference. But here’s what happens, after a certain number of years, they wear out. And did you ever see a windmill when it’s shot, like Joe, what happens? No, you know what happens to it. It starts to rust, they don’t paint it. The maintenance gets bad and then they just turn it off. Take a look at California where they have windmills that have been … that are old. And nobody wants to take them down because it’s not a lot of profit in taking them down. So they’re sitting there all rotten and rusty, it’s terrible. And then I hear the environmentalists love them. We got to talk to the environmentalists [inaudible 01:11:26].\nDonald Trump: (01:11:28)\nAnd they cannot … you know solar, I like solar, but solar is very expensive and it doesn’t have the power to fire up our massive plants. We have big plants, including in this great state and you can’t fire them up with this stuff. You can’t fire it. We need the strength because we’re competing against a lot of nations and they don’t go through what we do. They don’t care about the air and they should, and they should, which is another problem. I took you out of that crazy Paris Climate Accord, because it was totally disaster. No, it was a way of hurting the United States. I tell you, we would have had a close 20, 25% of our factories in order to even … it was so crazy, so expensive but I took you out. I was surprised people, most people, they appreciate what I did. Because you think it was easy doing that? It was actually, I thought it would be devastating. I got one day of bad press, after that, everybody forgot about it. It wasn’t that bad. But I did the right thing for our country and we want to have our great plants working. We want to have our great plants fired up.\nSpeaker 5: (01:12:29)\nFour more years!\nDonald Trump: (01:12:31)\nThey said manufacturing jobs are dead, right? Sleepy Joe said, “I’m going to bring back manufacturing.” Really? Well, Obama said, you’d need a miracle to bring back manufacturing. I brought back 650,000 jobs. He said you’d need a miracle. And now sleepy Joe is saying that, no, no, no. I’ve got to bring back … He’s not going to bring back anything. I made history by signing an executive order making the official policy of the United States government to buy American and to hire American. Now I did this long time ago. And then I see a sign in front of Joe right here, right here, it said, buy American. Oh great, Joe, thanks, Joe. Where have you been for 47 years? Because for 47 years, Joe Biden did the opposite. He crushed the dreams of American workers and enriched foreign countries. That’s how China happened. Hey, look what I’ve done. I’ve taken billions, tens of billions of dollars out of China. Nobody else did it before me, I mean, no other president. In all fairness, in all fairness to Obama and Biden, I call him, Obiden because it’s easier, Obiden.\nDonald Trump: (01:13:41)\nIn all fairness to Obiden, I mean, they didn’t do any of that. But now I see buy American. Hey, he also copied on the pandemic. Did you see he copied everything I was doing? Except one thing, he wouldn’t have closed the country to China so hundreds of thousands of people would have died from that. But two months, two and a half months later, he admitted that I was right. Thank you very much, Joe, I appreciate it. And yesterday he made, I think he made a mistake. Well, what do you think, the USMCA, what’s better that or NAFTA? Well, no, the USMCA is better. Was that Jake Tapper? I like Jake Tapper, was that … I don’t think he was doing … I don’t think he likes me too much, but that’s okay. They said what’s better, they said, what’s better. He goes, “USMCA. Well, that’s the deal that Trump made. Oh, it is? Oh.”\nDonald Trump: (01:14:34)\nThat’s a great deal we made. We took the horrible NAFTA deal. We got rid of the NAFTA. We got rid of TPP. We got rid of that terrible, terrible South Korea deal, which Hillary Clinton said, will produce 250,000 jobs. She said, this will produce 200 … she made it. Hillary, crooked Hillary. She made it, no wait, she said it’s going to produce 250,000 jobs. And she was 100% right, it produced 250,000 jobs for South Korea, not for us.\nDonald Trump: (01:15:03)\nIt produced 250,000 jobs for South Korea. Not for us. South Korea did very well with that deal, but I changed that deal a lot. That’s now a good deal. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to American workers. When we ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new USMCA Mexico-Canada Agreement into law.\nDonald Trump: (01:15:21)\nYou’re not going to see companies leaving for Mexico very much anymore. They’re not going to be leaving your community, going to Mexico, making a product, selling the product back in, not being taxed at the border. Doesn’t work that way anymore.\nDonald Trump: (01:15:35)\nIt’s probably the biggest reason I ran for president if you want to know that… and these stupid, endless wars. I saved the Uni-… but that’s one of the reasons Washington doesn’t like me. They love those endless wars. You got to ask them, “Why?” Do you ever watch where they’re very critical of me.\nDonald Trump: (01:15:51)\nI mean, “We don’t like him on foreign policy.” Really? Look what I’ve done. Look what I’ve done. Israel… We’re signing deals all over the place. These guys that are lecturing all the time, they don’t have a clue. They’re clueless. They were clueless. That’s why for 40 years you got nothing except blood in the sand. That’s all you got. Blood in the sand.\nDonald Trump: (01:16:11)\nI saved the US auto industry by withdrawing from last administration’s job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China’s rampant theft of American jobs. They don’t like me too much. Joe Biden’s agenda is, “Made in China”. My agenda is, “Made in the USA”. That’s the way.\nDonald Trump: (01:16:37)\nFor the last four years, I’ve been delivering for our incredible Hispanic… I love a Hispanic community. Oh, there was a poll today. Did you see it? Did you see the poll? Oh, this was a biggie. They had a poll today that with the Hispanic voter, they call them Latino, Hispanic. They use different terms. To me, I just loved the people. I don’t care, but let me just… Did you see it?\nDonald Trump: (01:17:05)\nTrump is leading Biden with the Hispanic community. Trump is leading Biden. Well, Hispanics like tough people. They like people that are going to produce jobs. They like… And by the way, the Hispanics understand the border better than anybody else. They’re better than anybody else. No, but we’re being… you know, it’s unusual that a Republican would be leading a Democrat, not… it’s habit. You know what the problem is, it’s habit. But the Hispanics get it.\nDonald Trump: (01:17:45)\nAnd we’re leading with the Hispanic community. And that’s because you had the lowest job numbers in the history of our country. You had the best home ownership. Every statistic was the best. And now we’re doing it again, except we’re doing it very rapidly. Remember 8.4%. We could have been at 44%, if stupid people ran it, 8.4%.\nDonald Trump: (01:18:08)\nI’m fighting for school choice, safe neighborhoods, low taxes and regulations on Hispanic-owned, small businesses. We’re fighting. You know, the Hispanic-owned, small businesses, they’re great business people. I know it from being in business. They were very tough. They were great business people and they get it. They get it like very few people get it. I’m also standing up for religious liberty.\nDonald Trump: (01:18:33)\nJoe Biden would be… So Joe Biden would be a disaster for all communities, not just the Hispanic communities, pledged to wage attacks on Catholic organizations, like the Little Sisters of the Poor that we’re helping. And we’re winning with them. We’re helping them. They got hit so hard by Oh Biden. They got hit so hard. I remember them in the Supreme Court, the Little Sisters of the Poor. They get hit by Biden. And then he says, “How wonderful.” He’s such a wonderful person. He supports taxpayer-funded, extreme, late-term abortion. And I mean, ninth month, ninth month, ninth month.\nDonald Trump: (01:19:22)\nAnd he’d allow violent mobs to burn down your business. And he would hand your country over to the socialists. But I believe it’s worse than socialists. I do. I think it’s a step worse than socialist. And it starts with a C. That is why we’re going to win a record share of the Hispanic vote in November. So important. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\nDonald Trump: (01:19:48)\nIt’s so important. We’re bringing it back very fast. I think next year is… Next year, I believe will be as good or better than the year we had last year. Unless somebody comes in and decides to quadruple your taxes, then I can’t. Then all bets are off, but we’re going to have… We’re lowering taxes. He’s raising taxes. We’re going to have tremendous growth.\nDonald Trump: (01:20:10)\nJoe Biden’s party continues to attack our incredible border agents. They’re incredible people, more than half of whom happen to be Hispanic-Americans. Did you know that? I know all of them. “Jose, how you doing?” “Juan, how you doing?” Every sixth time, I’d say, “Hello, Jim, how are you?” These extraordinary patriots deserve our admiration, gratitude and respect, not Joe Biden’s contempt. He’s got contempt for these people that are so great and brave.\nDonald Trump: (01:20:42)\nThat’s a tough job. My administration’s achieved the most secure border in American history. We ended the catch and release disaster. Remember you’d catch somebody, “What’s your name?” “I don’t know.” “What’s your address?” “I don’t know.” “Okay. Go into our country. That’s okay.” You couldn’t arrest anybody. We ended it, stopped asylum fraud and we’ve deported over 20,000 gang members, including MS13 and over a half a million criminal illegal aliens.\nDonald Trump: (01:21:11)\nNow think about it. Think of that number. Think if you at a half a million people spread throughout the country that were criminal, illegal aliens. Some of these are very violent people and we get them the hell out. We’re stopping human trafficking, protecting the victims, most of whom are women, most of whom are women. Human trafficking because of the internet that’s a tremendously big and horrible business. These are the worst human beings of all.\nDonald Trump: (01:21:40)\nBut most of the victims are women, children to a much lesser extent, but women and human traffickers. And you know what made it that way is the internet. Who would think? It almost sounds like an ancient crime. It’s not. It’s very modern because of the internet because of the computer. And it’s a horrible thing and we’ve stopped so much of it. We have an incredible group of people that go after these animals.\nDonald Trump: (01:22:05)\nAnd we built now over 320 miles of border wall and are adding 10 new miles a week. And the wall will very soon be finished. It’ll be finished. We’ve invested $2.5 trillion in the US military. We’ve rebuilt our depleted… It was a depleted military. Now we have the newest, we have the best we’ve ever had and launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in nearly 75 years, the US Space Force.\nDonald Trump: (01:22:41)\nAnd we did things that people said couldn’t be done. After 52 years, we passed VA Choice in VA Accountability and 91% of our veterans now approve of their VA care. They think it’s doing great. The fact is I did more in 47 months as president than Joe Biden did in 47 years. It’s true. It’s true. I withdrew from last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi.\nDonald Trump: (01:23:20)\nWe eliminated the world’s number one terrorist and mass murderer of American troops, Qasem Soleimani. He’s dead. He’s gone. Biden voted for the Iraq War. He opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed killing Soleimani. He oversaw the rise of ISIS and he cheered the rise of China as a very positive development. Oh, really? Tell me about it. Tell me about it. Not too positive.\nDonald Trump: (01:23:48)\nJoe Biden has been on the wrong side of history for 47 years. In fact, the secretary of state, secretary of defense said about him, “He’s never called it right. He never called it right.” If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would right now have died. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. You know that, especially with ventilators and equipment and masks and shields.\nDonald Trump: (01:24:18)\nWe’re delivering life-saving therapies that have achieved among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world. And you don’t hear that from the fake news. Europe’s excess mortality rate is 24% higher. And these are statistics that come from people that do this stuff, right? This is not done by my secretary. 24% higher than the United States and despite their punitive lockdowns, they’re once again seeing a spike.\nDonald Trump: (01:24:47)\nThey’re seeing a big spike in cases over there. They did the heavy lockdowns, just like you’re doing right here. And they’re seeing a spike. And there’s no reason for that. The United States has experienced the smallest contraction of any major Western nation. Think of that. And by far, the fastest recovery.\nDonald Trump: (01:25:09)\nAnd if they wrote about it properly, it would be a proper thing, a proper thing to do. Through our historic relief programs, we’ve saved more than half a trillion Nevada cops and jobs and all of this yet. So many people going out. We’ve saved 42,000 Nevada businesses. Think of that.\nDonald Trump: (01:25:26)\nBiden would terminate this comeback. He wants to end it. He would terminate this comeback. He would put your families in danger. He will totally destroy Social Security. And in my opinion, if you look at what he’s going to do to Medicare, they will destroy Social Security. They will. You called it. You know what you’re talking about? Exactly, right.\nDonald Trump: (01:25:49)\nHe’s going to massively raise your taxes. Reimpose crippling federal regulations, destroy your Social Security and destroy protections for pre-existing conditions. He’s going to destroy that and decimate your 401ks and retirement savings and stocks. Your stocks are going to go down like you never saw anything go down before. He’ll obliterate your Second Amendment. He’ll give you… And he would, he would give free… He wants to give free healthcare to illegal aliens that will bankrupt Medicare.\nDonald Trump: (01:26:21)\nHe wants to give… You saw him raise his hand. Remember the debate where they’re all standing there and he looked around, “Who’s going to give free healthcare to illegal aliens?” And everyone’s raising hands. He’s going, “Oh…” Now take a look. I’m not kidding. It’s sad. It’s pathetic.\nDonald Trump: (01:26:41)\nHe would end our travel bans on jihadist regions and increase refugee admissions 700%, opening the flood gates to terror-afflicted nations. You understand that. He’ll establish a national sanctuary city policy for criminal, illegal aliens. He loves sanctuary cities, meaning the people that control him love sanctuary cities.\nDonald Trump: (01:27:02)\nBiden, pledges to oppose school choice. And he has stated that if he is elected charter schools are “gone”. They’re gone. In the second term, and we’ve already started it very heavily, I will provide school choice to every parent in America.\nDonald Trump: (01:27:24)\nA vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs and a limitless future for all Americans. Instead of letting Washington change us, despite all that we’ve been through and we’ve been through more than any president has ever been through with these characters and they’re falling one after another. But you do notice that I hope. One after another. Oh, I see the phones have been wiped out. I wonder what that’s all about, but that’s a criminal thing you did. We are changing Washington. We are changing Washington.\nDonald Trump: (01:27:55)\nNever forget that they’re coming after me because I am fighting for you. And it’s true. Over the next four years to conclude, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all.\nDonald Trump: (01:28:18)\nWe will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring economies and a record prosperity, even greater than last year. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities and ban sanctuary cities.\nDonald Trump: (01:28:48)\nWe will appoint prosecutors, judges, justices, and believe… We will believe in enforcing the law. We want law and order. We have to have it. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms.\nDonald Trump: (01:29:25)\nWe will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless foreign wars. And we are bringing our troops home as we speak tonight. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength.\nDonald Trump: (01:29:48)\nWe will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. It’s already signed, starts on January 1st. I don’t want anyone to… I know ours is a big deal. I don’t want Sleepy Joe to take care of… Can you imagine? I’ll be watching. “Prices have dropped substantially all throughout the country because of price…” And I’m the one that got it done.\nDonald Trump: (01:30:11)\nAnd he’ll say, “What did I do? What did I do? How did this happen?” And we’ll further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs. We just did favored nations. We’re going to come down to the lowest price anywhere in the world because we did a favored nations clause. You know what that is? We will… The drug companies don’t exactly like me too much. They’re spending millions of dollars on negative commercials.\nDonald Trump: (01:30:35)\nPlease understand when you see those commercials, it means your drug prices are coming down. We will strongly protect Medicaid and Social Security, which they will give up. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions and America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. And we will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, “In God We Trust.”\nDonald Trump: (01:31:36)\nFor years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of Nevada. So very importantly, get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers and get out and vote on November 3rd.\nDonald Trump: (01:32:04)\nFrom Carson City to Elko, from Las Vegas to Reno and from Clark County to right here in Douglas County, we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded American patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty. They want to secure our liberty. Think of it and defend our freedom. Nevada was founded by pioneers and prospectors, miners and cowboys, innovators and trailblazers, tough people, great people who tamed the frontier, raised up the mighty Hoover Dam, lit up the brilliant lights of the Vegas Strip and transformed a sprawling desert into a shining oasis. So true.\nDonald Trump: (01:32:52)\nOur American ancestors made this into the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth. And we are making it greater than it ever has been. We are making it greater than ever before. We are making it greater than it’s ever been. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country.\nDonald Trump: (01:33:20)\nWe are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We’re going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.\nDonald Trump: (01:33:47)\nAnd together with the incredible people of Nevada, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you very much.\nDonald Trump: (01:34:15)\n(silence)"}, {"claim": "Police: Political Activists Didn’t Cause Oregon’s Wildfires", "required_reannotation": true, "label": "Supported", "justification": "Oregon’s Wildfires were majorly caused by rare windstorm in addition  to the heat which Oregon was experiencing at that time, according to NASA.

Kangana had filed a petition earlier today challenging the BMC notice.\nJustice SJ Kathawalla, while hearing the plea, asked the BMC how it entered the premises in the absence of the owner. The BMC has been asked to file an affidavit in response to the petition. The matter will be heard tomorrow.\nThe 33-year-old actor is scheduled to arrive Mumbai from Himachal Pradesh later in the day.\nKangana hit back at the BMC, saying the civic body should concentrate on the shoddy state of roads in the city instead of targeting her bungalow.\n\"BMC, these are mumbai road and all you are concerned about is DEMOLITION of an actress house who is exposing mafia.

That was, really, a very special time I had speaking to some of the labor union heads and other people. They're very happy with the way things are going. As you probably see, the numbers are terrific. So we called some people, wished them a very happy Labor Day, and they told us how they're doing, and we really celebrate the American worker. We are in the midst of the fastest economic recovery in U.S. history. So we have a lot to be thankful for, including this really beautiful day. It's why I thought we'd do this outside as opposed to in your more normal place. The United States experienced the smallest contraction of any major Western nation. You probably know that. You look around and see how we're doing compared to every other nation, and our rise is spectacular. And we're rebounding much more quickly from the pandemic. The U.S. economy added 1.4 million jobs last month, and we've have added a record-setting 10.6 million jobs since May. 10.6 million jobs since May. That's a record that is not even close. Second place is a long ways away. In July, the Congressional Budget Office was projecting unemployment over 10.5 percent through the end of 2020. So they thought 2020, and maybe it would be a lot longer than that. Some projections, where you'd go through the entire year, and that includes a lot of months in the following year, 2021. And instead, the unemployment rate plunged, really, to the surprise of many, all the way down to 8.4 percent in August. And that's the second-largest single month decline on record. And we have the first; we have both of them. So we have the two number-one declines -- \"decline\" meaning positive, not negative. We're currently witnessing the fastest labor market recovery from an economic crisis in history -- world history. By contrast, Biden presided over the worst, the weakest, and slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. It was a long, slow slog, and it was a very small -- very small on growth and very small on every other factor that you need. It was the weakest recovery. Under my leadership, next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country, I project. And some people are starting to agree. We have a \"V\" shape. It's probably a \"super V.\" And you see what's going on with the stock market, where it's, in certain cases, already setting records. NASDAQ has set 17 records already, and this is as we're, hopefully, rounding the final turn in the pandemic. First, we'll end the pandemic. Under Operation Warp Speed, we've pioneered groundbreaking therapies, reducing the fatality rate 85 percent since April. You don't hear that from the press very often. They don't like to talk about that. So the fatality rate, 85 percent -- think of that -- since April. The United States has experienced among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world. And we are an absolute leader in every way. Under my leadership, we'll produce a vaccine in record time. Biden and his very liberal running mate -- the most liberal person in Congress, by the way, who's not a competent person, in my opinion; would destroy this country and would destroy this economy -- should immediately apologize for the reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric that they are talking right now, talking about endangering lives. And it undermines science. And what's happening is, all of a sudden, you'll have this incredible vaccine, and because of that fake rhetoric -- it's a politic rhetoric; that's all it is. Just for politics. Because now they see we've done an incredible job, and in speed like nobody has ever seen before. This could've taken two or three years, and instead it's going to be -- it's going to be done in a very short of period of time. Could even have it during the month of October. So, contrary to all of the lies, the vaccine that they're -- they politicalize. They'll say anything. And it's so dangerous for our country, what they say. But the vaccine will be very safe and very effective, and it will be delivered very soon. You could -- you could have a very big surprise coming up. I'm sure you'll be very happy. But the people will be happy. The people of the world will be happy. Next, we'll return to unprecedented prosperity through our pro-American policies. We'll pass new tax cuts to boost take-home pay. We're going to be cutting taxes very substantially. We get it back through growth. We had tremendous growth until we got hit with the China virus. We'll continue our historic regulatory reduction campaign. We've -- as you know, in three and a half years, we've cut more regulations than any other administration, no matter how long, no matter what period of time you're talking about. We'll enact fair trade deals, and we're working on seven major fair trade deals right now. And when I say \"fair,\" fair to our country -- because our country was ripped off by every nation. Friend, foe, didn't matter: Every nation was ripping us off at a level that it's just unbelievable, to be honest. We're going to be expanding Opportunity Zones, and we will keep that going. It's been a tremendous -- a tremendous program. I want to thank Senator Scott, South Carolina, for coming up with that whole concept, because he came up, and I liked it right away, and it was -- it's really turned out to be a tremendous thing, especially for African Americans, Hispanic Americans. We'll continue to unleash American energy. We're number one in the world. And we're totally energy independent right now. And in 2021, we'll create 10 million jobs, at least, in the first 10 months. Joe Biden and the radical, socialist Democrats would immediately collapse the economy. If they got in, they would collapse it. You'll have a crash the likes of which you've never seen before. Your stocks, your 401(k)s -- remember, it's the people that own these massive, listed companies. A lot of people: rich people and not so rich people and middle-income people. And those stocks will crash like you've never seen before. The Biden plan begins with a 4-trillion-dollar tax hike. And that will end everything, including growth. There won't be growth. There'll be total contraction. Biden has also pledged to demolish the U.S. energy industry and implement the same policies causing blackouts in California. He wants to have things lit up with wind. He'll have to talk to China, Russia, India, and lots of other countries, because they're not doing that. And if they're not doing it, it puts us at a tremendous economic disadvantage, and it doesn't work. You take a look at the blackouts in California; it's really rather amazing what's going on there. They've tried to go, and that's just with a small portion going that route. That doesn't work, and it can't fire up our big plants. We're going to have this great industry that we've created. Can't fire up our big plants. Biden's plan for the China virus is to shut down the entire U.S. economy. He's going to totally rely on somebody to walk up, \"Yes, sir, it's time to shut it down.\" He'd be laying off tens of millions of workers and causing countless deaths from suicide, substance abuse, depression, heart disease, and other very serious illnesses. Because when you do a shutdown, there's a problem on the other side; it's not just from the virus. You have a big problem with suicides, with losing your jobs, with all sorts of things. You just take a look. Depression is a massive problem. And what happens is you -- they turn to substance abuse, alcohol, drugs. So we can't do that. And then we'd have to give up all of the gains that I've been talking about over the last three months. We've -- what we have done is incredible. We're setting records. All over the world, no matter where you go, nobody has done what we've been able to do. So we're setting records in jobs. We're setting records in numbers. And you're going to see some very big numbers. Third-quarter numbers are coming out right before a very special day, November 3rd. So you have the numbers coming out, and they're, I think, going to be fantastic. You know, I think they're going to be fantastic. The best numbers of all, if somebody doesn't come along and raise taxes -- double, triple, quadruple your taxes -- will be the numbers from next year. But you're going to have a good third-quarter number coming out. And I think it's going to be hard for even the media to disparage that number. Biden wants to surrender our country to the virus, he wants to surrender our families to the violent left-wing mob, and he wants to surrender our jobs to China -- our jobs and our economic wellbeing. I've taken in billions and billions of dollars from China. No other President has done what I've done. I've given much of it to the farmers. I've given it to farmers and manufacturers, but I've given most of it to the U.S. Treasury. Nobody has done that. We haven't taken in 10 cents from China ever. They targeted our farmers, and I targeted them. And I gave $28 billion to our farmers. Our farmers wouldn't be existent right now. Right now, they're very happy. In fact, they're setting records on purchases. China is purchasing more corn than they've ever done. Record purchase of corn and soybeans, beef -- because they know I'm not happy with them. They know I'm not happy at all. And, frankly, I don't want to set the world necessarily to thinking too much about it right now, but there's been no country anywhere, at any time, that's ripped us off like China has. We lose billions and billions of dollars for years and years, decades. We've lost billions and billions and billions of dollars by dealing with China. We get nothing from China. They get nothing, other than loss, other than giving our money. And they take that money, and they build their military. And you see they're building up a powerful military. And it's very lucky that I've been building our up, because otherwise we'd be dwarfed right now by China. We would be a terrible thing. A terrible thing. We're way ahead on the nuclear front. We've upgraded our nuclear. Hope to God we never have to use it. But we would be in a position that we are not in right now. But China is spending the money we give them to build up their military. So when you mention the world \"decouple,\" it's an interesting word. So we lose billions of dollars, and if we didn't do business with them, we wouldn't lose billions of dollars. It's called \"decoupling.\" So you'll start thinking about it. You'll start thinking. They take our money, and they spend it on building airplanes and building ships and building rockets and missiles. And Biden has been just a pawn for them. He's been so easy. They dream about Biden. There was a report today that they hope that Joe Biden becomes President. If Joe Biden becomes President, China will own the United States, and every other country will be smiling also. They'll be smiling. When reports come out that certain countries don't really like me too much, that's not because of my personality, although it could be that also, frankly. It's because of the fact that I've been very tough on countries that have been ripping us off for so many years. If you look at NATO, with the exception of eight countries -- we're one of them -- every country is way behind. They're delinquent, especially Germany, in paying their NATO bills. That means we end up paying it, and we're not doing it. I told them; we're not doing it. And they've increased their spending now $130 billion, going up to $400 billion a year. It's all because of me. Then you hear the country doesn't like me. I mean, I can understand that, because President Obama and other presidents, in all fairness, would go in there and they'd make a speech and they'd leave. I went in there, I looked, and I said, \"This is unfair. We're paying for NATO.\" We're paying for NATO. Almost all of it. So they rip us off on the military and then they rip us off, with the European Union, on trade. And Biden doesn't have a clue. You know he doesn't have a clue. Everybody knows he doesn't have a clue. In primetime, he wasn't good. And now it's not primetime. He spent 47 years sending American jobs to China, to Mexico, and to other countries, while collecting millions of dollars in campaign and super PAC contributions from global corporations that got rich by making American workers poor. His son, \"Where is Hunter?\" -- Where is Hunter? -- I call him \"Where is Hunter?\" -- walked away with one and a half billion dollars to manage, even though he never did that before. He walked away with a fortune from Ukraine, from China, and from other countries. Between his son and his brother, you ought to read the statements. And the press doesn't pick that up. If I ever did that, it would be -- it would be hell, even worse than it's been. Okay? Even worse than it's been. What he's done is so incredible. \"I won't give them the billion dollars,\" he says. \"I won't give them, unless they get rid of that prosecutor.\" And then, voila, they got rid of the prosecutor. And the press doesn't even want to talk about it. You talk about quid pro quo. With me, there was none. With him, he's right on tape, and you don't want to cover it. You should be ashamed of yourselves. The press should be ashamed of themselves. But Biden shipped away our jobs, threw open our borders, and sent our youth to fight in these crazy endless wars. And it's one of the reasons the military -- I'm not saying the military is in love with me; the soldiers are. The top people in the Pentagon probably aren't because they want to do nothing but fight wars so that all of those wonderful companies that make the bombs and make the planes and make everything else stay happy. But we're getting out of the endless wars; you know how we're we doing. We defeated 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate -- 100 percent. When I was in -- when I came in, it was a mess; it was all over. They have it, in a certain color, all ISIS. A year later, I said, \"Where is it?\" \"It's all gone, sir. Because of you, it's all gone,\" because of my philosophy. But all gone. And I said, \"That's good. Let's bring our soldiers back home. Some people don't like to come home. Some people like to continue to spend money.\" One cold-hearted globalist betrayal after another, and that's what it was. Biden supported NAFTA. He supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Two disasters. The most disastrous trade deals in history, both of them. I can't tell you which was worse; they were both terrible. And as you know, I ended it, and I ended NAFTA. And we're looking at the World Trade Organization. They've become much better -- I will say that. We -- World Health, I got out of because we're spending $500 million. China was spending $38 million, and China controlled it. But World Trade, we're looking at it. They've been very nice to us lately, I will say that -- amazingly. We never used to win anything at the World Trade; would lose every case. Now, all of a sudden, we're winning a lot of cases. We just won $7 billion as a case. And they're talking to us much differently than they used to, because if they don't shape up, we're going to ship out. That's all. We're not treated fairly. China is treated as a developing nation. Developing nation. We're treated as a nation that's fully developed. We're not fully developed, as far as I'm concerned -- when you look around at Portland and you see what these Democrats are doing to our cities. Take a look at what's happening in New York and Chicago, where you have Democrat-run cities and mayors that are running, and governors that are running states so badly, and mayors running cities so badly. It's very sad to look at it. It's Democrat-run, every one of them that I see. I guess we could probably find one or two that aren't. But I don't -- so far, I haven't been able to. If you look at Biden, he supported TPP, Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have been a disaster; it would have destroyed our automobile business. By the way, many plants are being built right now -- auto plants -- in Michigan, just like I said. They're being built in Ohio; they're being built in South Carolina, North Carolina. They're being built all over and expanded at a level that we've never seen before, because I said to Japan and Germany and others: \"Sorry, you got to come here and build plants. Otherwise, we're going to have to make it very tough on you with tariffs.\" And we got out of the horrible Paris Climate Accord that he'll go back into because, you know, it sounds wonderful. It's a disaster for this country. They've basically taken away your wealth, the Paris Climate Accord. And the other countries don't have to adhere to it. China doesn't kick in until 2030; they don't have to do anything until 2030. We had very high standards. We would have had to close, under some scenarios, 25 percent of our businesses in order to qualify under this ridiculous Paris Climate Accord. It sounds good. It was very bad, very expensive. The New York Times has just published an entire story on Biden's China sell-outs, which is amazing for the New York Times. I appreciate that. In 2001, Biden said, \"The United States welcomes the emergence of a prosperous, integrated China on the global stage because we expect this is going to be a China that plays by the rules.\" They didn't play by the rules. They didn't play by the rules. The World Trade Organization, one of the reasons it's so bad is that China didn't play by the rules. We did. We did. But their rules were easier because they're considered a developing nation, so they had a much lower standard. But even that, they didn't play by the rules. That's when they became a rocket ship. They were flat-lined for years and years and years. Then they joined the World Trade Organization. And, frankly, they cheated. Okay? They cheated. I'll say it. What difference does it make? I feel much differently. I feel I made a great trade deal with China. Great. And they're buying. You know why they're buying? Because they know I'm not happy. That's why they're buying. And I talk about it because today is Labor Day, and it's a good to time talk about when we're being ripped off by countries. But nobody is even close to China. Biden cheered China's rise as a great power \"because great powers adhere to international norms in the areas of nonproliferation, human rights, and trade.\" Well, they didn't. They took advantage of stupid people. Stupid people. And Biden is a stupid person. You know that. You're not going to write it. But you know that. The cost of Biden's economic treachery was 60,000 shuttered American factories. And I heard this morning the real number is probably 70,000 -- 70,000 shuttered American factories. And he's talking about how wonderful it is with China. No, China has been very bad, on top of which we had the China plague sent to us and other viruses -- nothing near this serious -- but the swine, and we had other viruses sent in over the years that came from China. I wonder why. If Biden wins, China wins, because China will own this country. If Biden wins, China will own this country, and hopefully you're not going to be able to find that out. It's the most important election in our history, right now. Most important election in our history. Under my administration, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we'll end our reliance on China once and for all. Whether it's decoupling or putting in massive tariffs like I've been doing already, we're going to end our reliance on China because we can't rely on China. And I don't want them building a military like they're building right now, and they're using our money to build it. We'll manufacture our critical medical supplies in the United States. We'll create \"Made in America\" tax credits and bring our jobs back from China to the United States. And we'll impose tariffs on companies that desert America to create jobs in China and other countries. If they can't do it here, then let them pay a big tax to build it someplace else and send it into our country. We'll prohibit federal contracts from companies that outsource to China. And we'll hold China accountable for allowing the virus to spread around the world. Now you can understand why China would much rather see Sleepy Joe than Donald Trump. But as long as I'm President, we will never waver in our undying loyalty to the American worker and to our country as a whole. So, Happy Labor Day, everybody. Yeah. Go ahead. Thanks, Mr. President. The issue of what happened when you were in France continues to be a story. You're going to have to take that off, please. Just -- you can take it off. Your health -- how many feet are you away? I'll speak a lot louder. Well, if you don't take it off, you're very muffled. So if you would take it off, it would be a lot easier. I'll just speak a lot louder. Is that better? It's better, yeah. It's better. Mr. President, some people are having a hard time believing your denials of the Atlantic story because of what you said about John McCain in the past. Do you understand that? And have you asked John Kelly -- No, I don't understand that. And have you asked John Kelly to refute that story? No, I don't understand it at all, no, because I've always been on the opposite side of John McCain. John McCain liked wars. I will be a better warrior than anybody, but when we fight a war, we're going to win them. And, frankly, I was never a fan of John McCain. You know that; that's been very obvious. I was -- but I had to approve his entire -- his funeral. I wanted him to get -- he deserved a first-class -- you know, and it all was approved by me. We sent Air Force One to pick up the casket -- a lot of things. But, no, I was never a fan of John McCain because he wanted the endless wars, and I didn't. I thought that the way the vets were taken care of -- our great vets -- was not good, not appropriate. And, of course, he took the fake, dirty dossier and gave it over to the FBI. So this is not somebody -- am I supposed to say, \"What a wonderful guy\"? So, you know what? I lived with him. He lived with me. But we had different philosophies. I think my philosophy is right. I think it's turned out to be right. But I wasn't a fan. But I respect people, and I respect a lot of people. That doesn't mean I necessarily have to agree with them, and I didn't agree with him on a lot of things. The story is a hoax, written by a guy who has got a tremendously bad history. The magazine itself -- which I don't read, but I hear it's just totally anti-Trump; he's a big Obama person, he's a big Clinton person. And he made up the story. It's a totally made-up story. In fact, I was very happy to see Zach Fuentes came out and said now he's -- that's -- I think that's number 15 -- and these are people that were there. That's the 15th person. General Kellogg, everybody that was there knew what happened. And so I was happy to see that Zach came out and said it's not true. He just came out. And it's a disgrace. Who would say a thing like that? Only an animal would say a thing like that. There is nobody that has more respect for not only our military, but for people that gave their lives in the military. There's nobody -- and I think John Kelly knows that. I think he would know that. I think he knows that from me. But Zach Fuentes, as you know, worked for John. And I think they both know that. But Zach came out, as you know, today or yesterday, last night, and said very strongly that he didn't hear anything like that. Even John Bolton came out and said that was untrue. Now, what was true is that we had the worst weather. I think it was as bad a rain as I've just about ever seen. And it was a fog you -- you literally couldn't see. I walked out, and I didn't have -- I didn't need somebody to tell me. I walked out and I said, \"There's no way we can take helicopters in this.\" I understand helicopters very well. And they said, \"No, sir, that's been cancelled.\" They would have had to go -- Secret Service, I have the whole list -- they would have had through a very, very busy section, during the day, of Paris. They would have had to go through the city. The Paris police were asking us, \"Please don't do it,\" because they're not ready. When you do that, you need a lot of time. They take days and days and days to prepare for that. I wanted to do it very badly. I was willing to sit in the car for two hours, three hours, four hours. I didn't care. It didn't matter. And I had nothing else to do. I went there for that; I had nothing else to do. It was ended because of the terrible weather, and nobody was prepared to go through, in terms of Paris, the police, the military, and the Secret Service. And they came out very strongly and said, \"Sir, we can't allow you to make this trip.\" If I wanted to: \"Sir, we can't allow you, from a safety standpoint.\" It was a phony story, just like the dirty dossier -- the fake, dirty dossier; just like the Russia collusion; just like all of the other phony stories. And there'll be more phony stories. But I do appreciate Zach coming out. But Zach now is the 15th person that's denied it. Zach now, I think, also talked about the weather aspect of it. And he's probably the 14th or 15th person that blamed it on weather. So that's enough of that. Yes, please. Thank you. Christina Bobb, One America News. Thank you for holding the briefing. Thank you. We're seeing judges, most recently in Detroit, limit police ability to use non-lethal force. My first question would be: Should the police be allowed to use non-lethal force to quell the violence in their cities? We're talking about where? Non-lethal force? Right. So in the riots, most recently -- The riots? Yeah. Well, I think what's happened is the -- the toughness. These are Democrat-run cities, all. And there's no -- there's no retribution. There's no -- they stand there, they throw things at the people that are supposed to be protecting something, and nothing happens. They throw rocks. They throw cans of soup. They throw lots of hard objects. And rarely does anything happen. But I've told, when we have the federal in there -- as you know, I told the U.S. Marshals to go get the man who killed a -- another man. And they know who it was, and you have to arrest him. You have to arrest him. After two and a half days, they didn't arrest him. The U.S. Marshals went in, and it ended up being a gunfight, and the man was killed. But this is a man that had a bad record, and this is a man that killed a man in the street. I mean, I witnessed it; most people witnessed it. And the U.S. Marshals went in; they weren't playing games. They can't play games. If somebody is breaking the law, there's got to be a form of retribution. I watch -- so often, when I watch some of the areas that we're talking about -- now we have Rochester -- that's, again, Democrat governor, Democrat mayor. All Democrats, every one of them, and it always will be. I was with the governor in Texas; he looked at me and said, \"I can't imagine how they allow this to happen.\" And, you know, it's different. It's different. I could talk about other governors saying the same thing. Yeah, please, go ahead. If I could follow up on that. We're also hearing reports of groups like Antifa and Black Lives Matter traveling around the country, leaving their home cities to go riot and protest in other cities where they're causing damage. Yeah. Do we expect to see prosecution or charges -- Yeah. -- from the Department of Justice for those traveling for that purpose? So we have now over 1,000 people -- federal -- in jail. We're prosecuting many people. A big thing was when I signed the law putting people in jail, if you knock down monuments. That was three months ago. There hasn't been a federal monument knocked down in three months, or even thought about. I don't think they've even thought about it. So that's had a very big impact -- a very big impact. But, yeah, we're going around, and the nice part is you people take -- see those people up there? -- they take nice pictures of everybody, so we don't even have to bother. We can use the news photos. We had a photo right over there of Andrew Jackson, the monument. He was getting ready, and this guy was a big, brave guy, and he was up like this, and he was showing off to all his friends. And he got arrested, and so did a lot of other people get arrested. And I would say we have the ultimate proof. Now, in that case, we got there before they ripped down the statue of Andrew Jackson, which is so beautiful, which is right over there. But they never got it. But right after that, I signed a -- an order saying you go to prison for 10 years. And as soon as I signed that order, that was the end of the statues coming down. But they have other ideas. They've -- they've got plenty of ideas. They're not at want for ideas. Please, go ahead. Mr. Spunt -- David Spunt from Fox News. Mr. Trump -- Mr. President, thank you for taking my question. Sir, you talked a lot about the economy and touted the economy. Three weeks ago, in Bedminster, I asked you specifically why you have not called Democratic leadership in the White House to meet with them. If they don't want to meet, it's on them. A lot of people are criticizing you. I cover you on the weekends and stuff. You're -- I don't think they are. -- doing a lot of golfing. Why have you not met with them in person? Yeah. I mean, we're in September. There is no deal. There is no hope of a deal. I know. I know. We're two months out from the election. What do you say to -- Don't say there's \"no hope.\" Why do you say there's \"no hope\"? But what can you say to the millions -- What do you know? Well, what can you say -- it doesn't seem -- What do you know? It doesn't seem like there's hope, sir. And let me just tell you: I know my customers; that's what I do. I know Pelosi, I know Schumer very well. They don't want to make a deal because they think it's good for politics if they don't make a deal. This has nothing to do with anything other than you have to know who you're dealing with. I do. These are people that I don't have a lot of respect. I don't think they have a lot of respect for the American people. And I know who I'm dealing with. And I don't need to meet with them to be turned down. They don't want to make a deal because they know that's good for the economy. And if they make a deal that's good for the economy, and therefore it's good for me for the election in November -- November 3rd, and therefore they're not going to make a deal. Now, if we gave the store away, if we bailed out all of their Democrat-run cities where we give them a trillion dollars, which is the kind of money they want -- they want a trillion dollars to bail out badly run, Democrat cities and states. Whether it's New York or Illinois or others, they want to bail them out. And we're saying, \"Well, we're not going to pay that kind of a price in order to bail the cities out.\" We'll do something to help cities, but that's going to have to rest on its own. And why didn't you do this at the beginning? Because they could have done it at the beginning. So I know who I'm dealing with. And I'm on the phone with Mnuchin and with Meadows and with all of these people constantly, you know, while they're there. But I also know when it's time to meet with people. I've done very well with deals, okay? That's what I do. And I know when it's time to meet. But I don't have to meet them in order to be turned down and in order for them to walk out to the sticks -- which is the microphones -- and give you people a false report of what just took place in the Oval Office. So they don't want to make a deal because they think that if the country does as badly as possible, even though a lot of people are being hurt, that's good for the Democrats. But, David, that's a bad thing. Yeah, please. Go ahead. But as President, shouldn't you take the high road, sir? I am taking the high road. I'm taking the high road by not seeing them. That's the high road. Yeah. And you -- Thank you, Mr. President. David -- And if I thought it made a difference or would make a difference, I'd do it in a minute. Yeah. Go ahead. Yeah, David Jackson, USA Today. My question is about the Durham report, which you have talked about recently. You said, \"Let's see what happens.\" Now, you've accused people of committing crimes against you during the Russia investigation -- Yeah. Sure. Sure. --including President Obama and Joe Biden. They spied on my campaign. That's right. Because my question is -- They spied on my campaign. And if they were Democrats, they would have been in jail two years ago. They would have been in jail -- literally, if this side were the Democrat side, they would have been in jail two years ago for 50-year terms for treason and other things. But excuse me, my question is: Do you want the Justice Department to indict people over this? I'm not going to say that. I have to see the report. I haven't seen -- I purposely -- I don't know if that was a good thing, smart thing. I don't know. But nobody can complain about it. I have every right to have been very much involved, and maybe someday I'll get involved in it. They spied on my campaign, and that includes Biden and Obama. They spied on my campaign trying to defeat me. They wrote up a fake dossier that has proven to be totally fake -- written by Christopher Steele, paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats -- and they used that illegally in the FISA courts. If we did what they did, you would have many people in jail all right -- right now. And you have, other than the one agent that admitted his guilt that he forged documents -- we don't have that yet, but the report hasn't been issued yet. Let's see what happens. It sure sounds like you want to prosecute people. But let me just -- let me just tell you something: President Obama and Biden -- Sleepy Joe, he knew everything that was happening. They were spying on my campaign, and they got caught. Now let's see what happens. But if this were the opposite way, people would have been jailed. They would have been in jail already for a period of at least -- it would have started two years ago, and it would have been 50 years for treason, because you can't do that. That's never -- and nothing like that's ever happened before. Then they created, at tremendous expense -- the money they paid is tremendous; I'm sure you know the money that was paid, millions of dollars. They created a fake dossier -- a fake dossier -- proven to be, now, fake. Everyone -- and they used it in the FISA courts. That's a crime. But it sure sounds like you want to prosecute -- So far, I haven't seen anybody have a problem. But the report hasn't been issued yet. Let's see what happens with the Durham report. But this started at Obama, and some people would say -- and some people, \"Well, but he was President,\" like, \"Let's leave him alone.\" If it were me, they wouldn't be leaving me alone, I can tell you. It's a totally double standard, and it's a -- it's a disgrace. And if I were a Republican senator and if I were a Republican congressman -- and we have some great ones, but we have a lot of them that don't fight the way that the other side fights. We have much better policy. We have much better things going for us, like borders and walls and immigration and no sanctuary cities. And a lot -- they have a lot of bad stuff going, but they're dirty fighters. And the dirtiest fight of all is the issuance of 80 million ballots, unrequested. They're not requested; they're just sending 80 million ballots all over the country. Eighty million ballots, non-requested. I call them \"unsolicited ballots.\" That's going to be the dirtiest fight of all. People are going to get ballots; they're going to say, \"What am I doing?\" And then they're going to harvest. They're going to do all the things. And if you look at the last period of six months -- take a look at the races where they've sent ballots out. Take a look at Carolyn Maloney, whose race should be redone because she won that race totally unfairly to her opponent. Her opponent did very well against her. That race should be rerun, but they declared her the winner because they heard I found out about it. But take a look at what's happened in New Jersey and in Virginia, in different places. It's a disgrace. That'll be a beauty. Yeah, please. Thank you, Mr. President. If proven true, are you okay with Postmaster General DeJoy and the fact that he asked former employees at his private company to make donations to the GOP and then reimburse them? Are you okay with that? Yeah, I don't know too much about it. I read something this morning, but I don't -- other than that, I'd have to see it. He's a very respected man. He was approved very much by both parties, I guess. It was sort of a -- an approval that took place by both parties. I don't know exactly what the story is. I'll certainly know within a short period of time. I just read it for the first time -- I read it this morning, just like you did. Would you support an investigation, sir? Sure. Sure. And in -- I think let the investigations go. But -- but he's a very respected man. Again, it was a bipartisan commission. Postmaster general is appointed by a bipartisan commission. And we'll see how that goes. But, no, I think he's a very honest guy, but we'll see. Yeah. He's proven to be a campaign -- Thank you, Mr. President -- Go ahead, please. Mr. President, just a follow-up, please, if you don't mind. If it's proven to be a campaign finance scheme, do you think he should lose his job? Yeah. If something can be proven that he did something, always. You know? Thank you. Always. They've been looking at me for four years; they found nothing. Four years. Think of it: For four years -- from the day I came down the escalator, I've been under investigation by sleaze, and they found nothing. They found nothing. A friend of mine said, \"You have to be the most innocent, honorable man ever to hold the Office of President.\" Think of it: They spent -- just Mueller alone, he spent -- I guess the real number turned out to be $48 million, but whatever it was -- many, many millions of dollars. They had 18 angry Democrats looking. They had FBI agents all over the place. They had every -- and they have no collusion. Friends of mine have said -- sophisticated friends have said, \"You've got to be the most innocent guy ever to hold this office.\" And there's a lot of truth to that. Yeah, please. Thank you, Mr. President. After Navalny poisoning, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is under pressure to cancel Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany. Would you support such a move? Sure. Do you think that the project should be canceled? Sure. Well, I've been support- -- I've been supportive of that. I was the first one that brought it up. You never heard of Nord Stream 2 until Trump came along. When I came along, I said, \"Wait a minute. We're protecting Germany from Russia, right?\" NATO. \"We're protecting Germany from Russia. Germany is paying Russia billions and billions of dollars to get their energy.\" And the real number is probably 60 to 70 percent, ultimately, of their energy is going to come from Russia. And I said this for years, that nobody talks about it. One of the many things, between sanctions and all of the -- what we've done for Ukraine, relative to what the past -- they used to send pillows, and we sent tank busters. But I brought that up a long time ago. Russia is unhappy that I brought it up. But you never heard of Nord Stream 2; nobody did, until I got elected. And I said, \"Why is Germany making a deal to give billions of dollars to Russia, and then we're protecting Germany from Russia? How does that work?\" And then, on top of it, Germany is delinquent because they're only paying a little more than 1 percent and they're supposed to be paying 2 percent, and even the 2 percent is low. But just remember: Trump -- me -- I got the countries of NATO to spend one point -- $130 billion, going to $400 billion a year. Think of it: $400 billion a year more for NATO. And the purpose of NATO primarily is Europe protection against Russia. Now, they can use it for other, I guess -- and they have a little bit in the Middle East, et cetera, et cetera. But I'm the one that did that. So -- but nobody talks about that. Nobody talks about Nord Stream 2. The answer is: Absolutely, if they feel that something happens. But I don't know that Germany is in a position right now, because Germany is in a very weakened position, energy wise. They're closing all their plants. They're closing their nuclear. They're closing their coal. They're closing a lot of plants. And they are -- they have put themselves in a very bad position, frankly. Very, very bad position. Yeah, please. Mr. President, can I follow up Jeff Mason's question? Have you asked John Kelly to publicly refute The Atlantic? And then, can I ask something else? No, I have nothing against John. I have nothing against anybody. No. I was very heartened to see that a friend of his -- because I know Zach is a friend of his and worked for him -- I was very heartened to see that Zach Fuentes came out with the statement that he did -- I guess, late last night -- that it was not true. Can I ask another question on a different topic, Mr. President? Mr. President, what exactly is un-American about federal government training programs that are aimed at improving inclusivity or pointing out biases? Well, we're going to do a report. Yeah, I fired those people; they're all gone. And it was a disgrace, frankly. And we're going to give you a big report that's going to make you very happy. All right, yeah, please. Thank you. Darlene Superville, AP. You said a moment ago, \"They'll say anything.\" You were talking about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and their comments about the vaccine. You have asserted -- No, they say worse; they say negative. They say negative. They're going to make the vaccine into a negative so that when we have it -- and I spoke to the head of Pfizer, I spoke to the head of Johnson & Johnson, I spoke to the head of the greatest medical companies in the world. We're doing great. We're going to have it soon. Right -- Wait a minute. So now what they're saying is, \"Oh, wow, this is bad news. President Trump is getting this vaccine in record time.\" By the way, if this were the Obama administration, you wouldn't have that vaccine for three years, and you probably wouldn't have it all. So we're going to have a vaccine very soon, maybe even before a very special date. You know what date I'm talking about. Yes. But let me just tell you -- wait. And what they're doing, because they think it is going fast. And if you talk to a lot of your sources -- if you have sources -- if you talk to your sources in the FDA, you'll see it's going very, very well. The numbers are looking unbelievably strong, unbelievably good. So now they're saying, \"Wow, Trump has pulled this off. Okay, let's disparage the vaccine.\" That's so bad for this country. That's so bad for the world to even say that. And that's what they're saying. But I watched Kamala's poll numbers drop from 15 to almost zero, and then drop out even before she ran in Iowa because people didn't like her, and I understand why. She will never be President -- although I have to be careful, because Obama used to say that about me. So I have to be a little bit careful. Right, but -- But you have to look at her a little bit more closely, because obviously Joe is not doing too well. So you're going to have to look at her a little bit too closely. But she's talking about disparaging a vaccine so that people don't think the achievement was a great achievement. I don't want the achievement for myself, I want something that's going to make people better, that people aren't going to get sick with. That includes therapeutics, where we're doing equally as well. Therapeutics. May I finish? May I finish the question? Go ahead. Your point is that: What they're saying is that they're saying it for a political purposes. Yes. You have asserted repeatedly that a vaccine will be on the market by -- before the election, by the end of October. No, I didn't say -- I didn't say \"they will.\" I said, \"By the end of the year.\" Aren't you doing the same thing that you -- No, but you're not quoting me accurately. -- say they're guilty of? I said that vaccines will be on the market before the end of year, but they may even be on the market -- they may even be developed and fully developed, tested, and everything else. You know, we have 30,000 people, in just one vaccine right now, under test in very, very highly infected areas. So we're going to be able to get a good result, one way or the other, very soon. So I didn't say what you said. What I said is \"by the end of the year.\" But I think it could even be sooner than that. It could be during the month of October, actually. Could be before November. But aren't you also saying that for political reasons? No, I'm saying that because we want to save a lot of lives. The fast -- with me, it's: The faster, the better. With somebody else, maybe they would say it politically, but I'm saying it in terms of this is what we need. We have to have -- if get the vaccine early, that's a great thing, whether it's politics or not. Now, do benefits inure if you're able to get something years ahead of schedule? I guess, maybe they do. But the most important thing to me is saving lives; it's the most important thing. Yeah, go ahead. In the back. Hi. Just based on some of your recent tweets, do you -- You sound so clear as opposed to everybody else, where they refuse. Your tweets about the 1619 Project -- Yeah. -- why do you object to that being taught in schools? And do you object to slavery itself being taught in schools? Yeah, so -- no, I want everybody to know everything they can about our history. I'm not a believer in cancel culture, the good or the bad. If you don't study the bad, it could happen again. So I do want that subject studied very, very carefully and very accurately. But we grew up with a certain history, and now they're trying to change our history -- revisionist history. That's why they want to take down our monuments. That's why they want to take down our statues. I saw something the other day, which was absolutely horrendous: Washington Monument, they want to rename it -- the D.C. committee, but the D.C. committee is all Democrats. Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson -- I mean, we're talking about -- this is the big stuff now. This is the big stuff. And they want to rename it. They want to re-designate it. They want to take some down. No, we don't do that. Never going to happen with me, I guarantee you that. Well, I want to thank you all, and I just want to wish you a very happy Labor Day. And we're having tremendous success, whether it's on the vaccines, whether it's on the pandemic -- the plague that came in from China, that China should have never let happen because I will never feel the same about China. And I just want to again wish you a happy Labor Day. Thank you very much, everybody."}, {"claim": "The Indian government has launched an online health consultation scheme.", "required_reannotation": false, "label": "Supported", "justification": "The source shows the number of completed online health consultations.", "claim_date": "6-9-2020", "speaker": "Manish Pangotra", "original_claim_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200906154343/https://twitter.com/ManishPangotra5/status/1302632954393325568", "fact_checking_article": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201026064418/https://newsmeter.in/fact-check-yes-indian-govt-has-launched-online-health-consultation-scheme/", "reporting_source": "Twitter", "location_ISO_code": "IN", "claim_types": ["Event/Property Claim"], "fact_checking_strategies": ["Written Evidence"], "questions": [{"question": "What is name is given to an online health consultation?", "answers": [{"answer": "Telemedicine, which is a method of providing medical care remotely, usually through video chat", "answer_type": "Abstractive", "source_url": "https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/telemedicine-benefits", "source_medium": "Web text"}]}, {"question": "Does India' have a national telemedicine service?", "answers": [{"answer": "Yes", "answer_type": "Boolean", "source_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/national-telemedicine-service-completes-over-1-5-lakh-consultations-health-ministry/articleshow/77449268.cms?from=mdr", "source_medium": "Web text", "boolean_explanation": "consulting a doctor from your home and getting medicines delivered has become second nature to many Indians"}]}], "orig_claim": "Indian govt has launched online health consultation scheme", "orig_verdict": "True", "fulltext": "“The Central Government has launched an excellent consulting scheme for senior citizens and all other citizens.\n Especially 4 Elderly people \nThis service is completely free.

For 2020, one Uyghur region set an unprecedented near-zero birth rate target: a mere 1.05 per mille, compared to 19.66 per mille in 2018. This was intended to be achieved through “family planning work.”\n\nIn 2018, natural population growth plummeted: to 4.06‰ in all minority regions and 2.58‰ in Kashgar and\nHotan. - In a drastic reversal of long-standing historic trends, the declines in Uyghur population growth have occurred mainly in the countryside. For example, Keriya County in Hotan had one of Xinjiang’s highest natural population growth rates in previous years, with rates being nearly double those of Hotan City. Its first marked decline occurred in 2016, but the by far most dramatic drop (to -0.49‰) took place in 2018.\n\nIn 2018, minority regions in Xinjiang also deployed mass health exams to identify family planning violations. Campaigns such as “testing all who need to be tested” (体检实现应检尽检, tijian shixian ying jian jin yian) were associated with curbing such violations (Yining City, January 22, 2019). “Zero birth control violation incidents” (违法生育零发生, weifa shengyu ling fasheng), a term that was not routinely used elsewhere in the PRC nor in Xinjiang prior to 2018, became a standard family planning target in 2018 and 2019.

Support trusted, factual information with a tax deductible contribution to PolitiFact.\nI would like to contribute\nHas COVID-19 killed more cops than all other causes?\nIf Your Time is short\n-\nTwo separate groups find that more law enforcement officers died from COVID-19 than all other causes, including gunfire and car accidents.\n-\nCorrections officers are included in the tally.\nAt the Republican National Convention, President Donald Trump cast himself as a stalwart friend of police and an effective leader in the fight against COVID-19.\nIn a speech in Pittsburgh, Democratic nominee Joe Biden said Trump was neither.\n\"Do you feel safer under Donald Trump?\" Biden asked Aug. 31. \"More cops have died from COVID this year than have been killed on patrol.\"\nThat stat raised eyebrows, and we checked to see if it was true. Biden didn’t say exactly what the best data show, but the comparison is largely accurate.\nTallies of deaths by two national groups show that COVID-19 has killed more law enforcement officers than gunfire and other hazards of the job in 2020. The caveat to Biden’s claim is there is some statistical fuzziness regarding who is a cop and what it means to be on patrol.\nRoughly one-third of these tallies include corrections and detention center officers who work inside institutions where the virus can spread more readily. Some Customs and Border Protection field officers and other first responders are also included. While these occupations are counted as part of law enforcement, they might not come to mind as the cops that Biden referred to.\nThe COVID-19 death toll is still the greatest single cause of death when those occupations are excluded.\nThe National Law Enforcement Officer Memorial Fund lists 101 dead officers from COVID-19 compared with 87 from anything else, including gunfire, car accidents or other causes. If it weren’t for COVID-19, officer deaths were on track to be lower this year than last.\nThe National Law Enforcement Officer Memorial Fund says on its website that before it adds an officer to its list of deaths due to the virus, \"substantive evidence will be required to show the death was more than likely due to the direct and proximate result of\" exposure in the line of duty.\nAnother source, the Officer Down Memorial Page, shows 101 deaths from COVID-19 and 81 deaths from all other causes. Communications director Jessica Rushing said the count is updated daily.\nFeatured Fact-check\n(The Fraternal Order of Police has tracked 208 deaths from COVID-19, but not fatalities from other causes. It notes that it doesn’t verify the COVID-19 deaths.)\nAccording to Rushing’s group, gunfire is the second most common cause of death.\nBy a factor of three, COVID-19 is the leading cause of death for the broad group of officers.\nThat has as much to do with the pattern of police fatalities as it does with the virus, said Rutgers criminologist Frank Edwards. Deaths in the line of duty due to any cause tend to average about eight each month.\nFBI data on deaths in the line of duty further back this point. The FBI numbers distinguish between accidental and felonious deaths of officers in the community. They show that in a typical month, criminal acts kill less than five officers a month.\nExcluding the corrections and detention officers, the toll from COVID-19 remains at about 70 in the Officer Down count — still double the loss of life due to gunfire, but not higher than the sum of other causes of death.\nBiden said that more cops have died from COVID-19 than while on patrol.\nCOVID-19 by itself has killed more law enforcement officers than all other causes combined, according to two groups that track these numbers.\nNo matter how we parsed the data — by excluding correctional and detention center officers, or by focusing on felonious deaths to officers that could be considered \"on patrol\" — COVID-19 posed the greatest single threat to officers’ lives.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.\nOur Sources\nC-SPAN, Joe Biden Delivers Remarks on Public Safety and Law Enforcement, Aug. 31, 2020\nOfficer Down Memorial Page, Fallen Officers From the COVID-19 Pandemic, Aug. 31, 2020\nOfficer Down Memorial Page, 2020 Honor Roll of Heroes, Aug. 31, 2020\nFraternal Order of Police, COVID-19 Line-of-Duty Deaths, accessed Aug. 31, 2020\nNational Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, Preliminary 2020 Fallen Officer Fatalities, Aug. 31, 2020\nNational Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, COVID-19 and its impact on law enforcement, Aug. 31, 2020\nFederal Bureau of Investigation, Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted, accessed Sept. 1, 2020\nEmail exchange, Jessica M.
