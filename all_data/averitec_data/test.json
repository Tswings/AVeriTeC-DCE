COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, was the \u201conly cause mentioned\u201d on death certificates in 6% of deaths involving the virus, the CDC said last week. Some people mistakenly took that to mean the remaining 94% of coronavirus-related deaths were caused by other underlying health conditions and not COVID-19. The misconception went viral on social media; Twitter removed a tweet on Sunday that promoted the false interpretation of the CDC\u2019s data, which President Donald Trump shared to his 85.6 million followers, media outlets reported. What the CDC\u2019s update really means is that 94% of the people who died from the coronavirus had at least one other health condition, in addition to COVID-19, that could have contributed to their passing \u2014 not that the additional factor was the sole reason for it. In fact, the CDC mentions that \u201cfor deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 2.6 additional conditions or causes per death.\u201d This aligns with what the agency has been saying all along. People over the age of 65 and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, obesity, heart disease and respiratory issues have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 and death from it. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s leading immunologist and a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force told \u201dGood Morning America\u201d on Tuesday that the CDC\u2019s report \u201creally did reflect the reality\u201d of those dying from COVID-19. \u201cThe point that the CDC was trying to make was that a certain percentage of them had nothing else but just COVID. That does not mean that someone who has hypertension or diabetes who dies of COVID didn\u2019t die of COVID-19 \u2014 they did.\u201d \u201cSo, the numbers that you\u2019ve been hearing, the 180,000 plus deaths are real deaths from COVID-19.",

The tweet said the remaining 94% had \u201cother serious illnesses.\u201d Fauci told the ABC program \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on Tuesday that the CDC guidance, last updated on Aug. 26, indicates that of the people who have died from the virus, \u201ca certain percentage of them had nothing else but just Covid.\u201d However, people with underlying illnesses also die from Covid-19, he said. That does not mean that someone who has hypertension or diabetes who dies of Covid didn\u2019t die of Covid-19. They did,\u201d Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the program. \u201cSo the numbers you\u2019ve been hearing -- there are 180,000-plus deaths -- are real deaths from Covid-19. Let (there) not be any confusion about that. It\u2019s not 9,000 deaths from Covid-19, it\u2019s 180-plus-thousand deaths",

One of the vaccines s the Comirnaty COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (also known as the \u2018Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine\u2019).\nWhat is mRNA?\n\nRibonucleic acid (RNA) is the genetic material in viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 virus). Once inside a human cell, SARS-CoV-2 RNA acts as messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), which is a type of molecule used by the virus as instructions for making the proteins it needs to function. Human cells generate mRNA for the same purpose.\nHow do mRNA vaccines work?\n\nVaccines prepare the body to defend itself against a specific disease. mRNA vaccines contain pieces of mRNA that tell the cells in the body how to make a viral protein that will be recognised by the immune system as foreign.\n\nIn this case, the mRNA contains instructions for the spike (S) protein on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The S protein helps the virus enter human cells.\n\nCopies of the S protein are made in the body. The immune system recognises the S protein copies as foreign and makes immune cells and antibodies which can recognise and attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus via the S protein.\n\nThe mRNA is broken down shortly after vaccination. Animal studies showed that the mRNA in the Comirnaty vaccine is broken down within a couple of weeks.\n\nIf the body is later exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the immune system is prepared to defend the body against illness. As a result some people may not get infected at all. Others will experience a much milder illness than they would have done without the vaccine.",

Vaccines traditionally contain either weakened viruses or purified signature proteins of the virus.\n\nBut an mRNA vaccine is different, because rather than having the viral protein injected, a person receives genetic material \u2013 mRNA \u2013 that encodes the viral protein. When these genetic instructions are injected into the upper arm, the muscle cells translate them to make the viral protein directly in the body.\n\nThis approach mimics what the SARS-CoV-2 does in nature \u2013 but the vaccine mRNA codes only for the critical fragment of the viral protein. This gives the immune system a preview of what the real virus looks like without causing disease. This preview gives the immune system time to design powerful antibodies that can neutralize the real virus if the individual is ever infected.\n\nWhile this synthetic mRNA is genetic material, it cannot be transmitted to the next generation. After an mRNA injection, this molecule guides the protein production inside the muscle cells, which reaches peak levels for 24 to 48 hours and can last for a few more days.",

This second pop-up emphasizes that the sources Facebook points to adhere to\u00a0Poynter\u2019s non-partisan code of fact-checking principles,\u00a0and it also links me to\u00a0Facebook\u2019s\u00a0official help page\u00a0on disputed content.\n\nFrom here,\u00a0Facebook links\u00a0me to pages on\u00a0Snopes and AP\u00a0that fact check the\u00a0Irish slavery story. (Spoiler: There was\u00a0no Irish slave trade.)\u00a0The\u00a0AP writes, \u201cThe false articles, trending on social media as Ireland\u2019s national holiday approaches Friday, typically reprint entire sections from a comprehensively debunked 2008 column posted on a website that promotes conspiracy theories.\u201d\n\nBut if I choose to ignore the\u00a0big warning symbol and go\u00a0ahead and click \u201cPost,\u201d the story is still not shared immediately. Another\u00a0pop-up reasserts that this content is \u201cdisputed,\u201d and I have to click \u201cPost Anyway\u201d\u00a0in order to share\u00a0the link on\u00a0my timeline.\n\nAnd if I\u00a0still\u00a0click\u00a0\u201dPost Anyway,\u201d it doesn\u2019t let me off the hook: Instead, it shows the warning flag below the post in my timeline.",

The Foundation for Government Accountability (FGA) supports the reforms implemented\nin this bill and highlights the need for such reforms to close loopholes that threaten the democratic\nprocess.\nThe Election Integrity Act of 2021 is a commonsense approach that makes it easy to vote and\nhard to cheat. It provides fair and consistent rules for Georgia elections statewide, a duty of the\nGeorgia legislature. These new rules include reasonable reforms such as replacing signature\nmatch with a government-issued photo identification requirement (Georgia issues free voter\nidentification cards), better security of ballot drop boxes, and broader access to voting for all\nGeorgians. Georgia\u2019s new law contains rational and sound policy provisions to ensure fair and\nfree elections, and its measures actually increase access to voting. 1\nBelow are some of the key provisions of the Election Integrity Act of 2021.

The data at that point only went through 2012, and with that limited time period one could not draw strong conclusions as to whether the assault weapons ban (with the law as written and implemented) had a major effect.  There were fewer mass shootings over most of the years in that 1994 to 2004 period, but 1998 and 1999 were notable exceptions.",

First of all, there was a grandfather clause that allowed manufacturers and others to sell all of their existing inventory.  Not surprisingly, manufacturers scaled up production sharply while the ban was being debated, as those inventories could later then be sold, and were.  Second and related to this, there was no constraint on shops or individuals on the sale of weapons that had been manufactured before the start date, provided just that they were legally owned at the time the law went into effect.  Third, \u201csemiautomatic assault weapons\u201d (which included handguns and certain shotguns, in addition to rifles such as the AR-15) were defined quite precisely in the Act.  But with that precision, gun manufacturers could make what were essentially cosmetic changes, with the new weapons then not subject to the Act.  And fourth, with the sunset provision after 10 years (i.e. to September 12, 2004), the Republican-controlled Congress of 2004 (and President George W. Bush) simply could allow the Act to expire, with nothing done to replace it.  And they did."

At the age of 11, he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music. His first band was called Bluesology. He later auditioned (unsuccessfully) as lead singer for the progressive rock bands King Crimson and Gentle Giant. Dwight teamed up with lyricist Bernie Taupin and changed his name to Elton John (merging the names of saxophonist Elton Dean and Long John Baldry). The duo wrote songs for Lulu and Roger Cook. In the early 1970s, he recorded the concept album \"Tumbleweed Connection.\" He became the most successful pop artist of the 1970s, and he has survived many different pop fads including punk, the New Romantics and Britpop to remain one of Britain's most internationally acclaimed musicians.\n\nElton John announced he was a bisexual in 1976, and in 1984, he married Renate Blauel. The marriage lasted four years before he finally came to terms with the fact that he was actually homosexual. In the 1970s and 1980s, he suffered from drug and alcohol addiction and bulimia but came through it. He is well known as a campaigner for AIDS research and he keeps his finger on the pulse of modern music, enjoying artists such as Eminem, Radiohead, Coldplay and Robbie Williams. He was knighted in 1997.",

Two were conservatives killed after pro-Trump \u201cpatriot rallies\u201d. All but one were killed by fellow citizens.\n\nAmerica's protest crackdown: five months after George Floyd, hundreds face trials and prison\nRead more\n\nThe new data highlights the danger of the presence of guns during politically charged protests, and raises concerns about continued violence during and after election day, when many Americans anticipate delays, confusion and protests before the winner of the presidential race is confirmed.\nViolence at US protests\n\nThe new data on fatalities and violence at American protests comes from a database created by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project (ACLED), a non-profit, working in collaboration with a group of researchers at Princeton.\n\nACLED, a widely cited source for data on civilian casualties in Yemen, has been a non-partisan monitor of protests and violence in the Middle East, Asia, Europe and Latin America, and launched its US Crisis Monitor in July, citing concerns over hate crimes and rising political violence.\n\nACLED found that the overwhelming majority of the more than 9.000 Black Lives Matter demonstrations that took place across the US after the killing of George Floyd have been peaceful. News reports at the height of demonstrations over Floyd\u2019s killing cited dozens of deaths in connection with protests, but many of those turned out to be examples of deadly crimes carried out in the vicinity of protests, rather than directly related to the demonstrations themselves, the researchers concluded.

We all know water cannot \u201cburn\u201d like traditional (fossil) fuels, but any hope of extracting energy from it at all, in some other way, can only be crushed by chemistry.\n\nA water molecule contains three atoms: an oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms, which bond together like magnets. According to Wai Cheng, a professor of mechanical engineering and director of the Sloan Automotive Lab (where he does research on engine performance and emissions, combustion science, and energy conversion), breaking those bonds will always take more energy than you get back.\n\nLet\u2019s say you wanted to build this car. It would need equipment to split a water molecule apart and separate its oxygen and hydrogen. Then it would need to isolate each of them in separate tanks. Then you would need a combustion system that could mix and ignite them, or a fuel cell that could recombine them to make electricity. The released energy could then drive a piston or run a motor and move the car.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem, Cheng says: \u201cA water molecule is very stable.\u201d The energy needed to separate the atoms is greater than what you get back \u2014 this process actually soaks up energy instead of giving it out.\n\nPlus there\u2019s a more volatile problem: hydrogen is dangerously flammable. Without the right safety measures, a fender-bender could turn into an explosion worthy of an Avengers movie.",

The landing system on Mars 2020 mission includes a parachute, descent vehicle, and an approach called a \"skycrane maneuver\" for lowering the rover on a tether to the surface during the final seconds before landing.\n\nThis type of landing system provides the ability to land a very large, heavy rover on the surface of Mars in a more precise landing area than was possible before Curiosity's landing. Mars 2020 takes things one step further. It adds new entry, descent, and landing (EDL) technologies, such as Terrain-Relative Navigation (TRN). This sophisticated navigation system allows the rover to detect and avoid hazardous terrain by diverting around it during its descent through the Martian atmosphere. A microphone allows engineers to analyze entry, descent, and landing. It might also capture sounds of the rover at work, which would provide engineers with clues about the rover's health and operations, and would be a treat to hear.",

Moreover, the correlation between domestic air traffic and COVID-19 spread became weaker following lockdown (before lockdown: r = 0.98, P < 0.05 vs after lockdown: r = 0.91, P = NS).\n\nConclusions: A significantly decreased growth rate and increased doubling time of cases were observed, which are most likely due to Chinese lockdown measures. A more stringent confinement of people in high-risk areas seems to have the potential to slow down the spread of COVID-19.",

Moreover, we demonstrated that milk contains anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and that their concentrations are correlated with milk\u2019s ability to effectively neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. We found evidence of SARS-CoV-2 on the areola/nipple region of several women, but it is unclear whether this RNA reflects viable virus. As such, our data do not suggest that infected women should systematically wash their breasts prior to breastfeeding or expressing milk. However, and in support of recommendations put forth by the WHO, if a mother who is confirmed/suspected to have COVID-19 has just coughed over her exposed breast, she should gently wash the breast with soap and warm water before feeding (37). Taken together with the well-documented benefits of breastfeeding to maternal and infant health, our data support recommendations to encourage breastfeeding in women with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 illness.",

A growing body of evidence supports the importance of breastfeeding for a child\u2019s growth,\ndevelopment, and health, as well as for helping them avoid obesity and noncommunicable diseases later in life.\nWhat is the risk forbreastfed infants?\nTo date, the virus that causes COVID-19 has not been detected in breastmilk.However, as the disease is new, this\nevidence is based on limited studies. Public health officials are continuing to learn about how the virus spreads and\nwhat kind of risks it poses to infants whose mothers have the disease. In limited studies among women with\nCOVID-19 and another coronavirus infection (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARs-CoV), the virus was not\ndetected in breastmilk. In a recent study from Wuhan, China, researchers collected and tested breastmilk samples\n(at first lactation) from six patients who had COVID-19 during pregnancy; all samples tested negative for the virus.\nHowever, more research is needed to confirm these results. Of importance, the experience obtained so far shows\nthat the disease course of COVID-19 generally is not severe in infants and young children.

Exton conceived the idea of baking a cracker to be used in oyster stews. In 1848, one year after the Exton crackers arrived on the Trenton scene, Ezekiel Pullen began baking an \"Original Trenton Cracker\" in the kitchen of his home. He sold his crackers from the back of his wagon as he made his way along Trenton streets. Both businesses grew as a craze for oysters developed in the 1860s and 1870s. OTC \u00ae crackers became available from wooden barrels in neighborhood stores and in seafood restaurants. During the Civil War, the Exton company supplied its crackers to the Union army.",

There is no current evidence linking the use of face masks to cancer, and science shows that any risks associated with wearing masks are low overall, while the benefits are high. \n\nBecause of how tiny oxygen and carbon dioxide molecules are, face masks neither decrease the amount of oxygen that enters a mask nor increase the amount of carbon dioxide that stays in a mask. As a result, face masks do not disrupt the body\u2019s pH levels, affect the bloodstream, or alter one\u2019s body in any way that would put someone at higher risk of cancer.",

One of the main reasons is linked to the production of the food we eat, the milk we drink and even the shoes on our feet. This is because livestock farming is a major source of the greenhouse gases that are warming our planet. You need to chop down a lot of trees to make pasture for animals to graze and you need a lot of energy to keep meat cool and transport it around the world. Perhaps most importantly, ruminant livestock like cows, sheep and goats produce a lot of the potent greenhouse gas, methane.Most people have got the wrong end of the stick, and indeed the wrong end of the animal, when it comes to the source of methane. The vast majority, over 95%, actually comes from the animal\u2019s breath. This happens when animals 'chew the cud', a process which involves chewing food that has already been partly digested by the first of four stomach compartments. When this happens animals also burp up methane, which can be measured. We have realised recently that the amount of methane that animals breathe out is very strongly linked to what they are eating. We call the plants that livestock eat \u2018forage plants\u2019.",

This process requires nucleotide triphosphates as substrates and is catalyzed by the enzyme RNA polymerase II. The process of making mRNA from DNA is called transcription, and it occurs in the nucleus. The mRNA directs the synthesis of proteins, which occurs in the cytoplasm. mRNA formed in the nucleus is transported out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm where it attaches to the ribosomes. Proteins are assembled on the ribosomes using the mRNA nucleotide sequence as a guide. Thus mRNA carries a \u201cmessage\u201d from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The message is encoded in the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA, which is complementary to the nucleotide sequence of the DNA that served as a template for synthesizing the mRNA. Making proteins from mRNA is called translation.",

ROQUE:  It's like this \u2013 it's been discussed, it's not yet covered by the IATF resolution, but it seems like there's a consensus \u2013 there's no choice, there's no compulsion. But you will sign a waiver that you did not get injected. And when you have priority, of course you lose priority. You will join the rest of the people who are waiting for the vaccine. So that's right, no, there's no choice because we can't really control what comes and it's free. But that's how it is, there is such a thing as waiver of a right. It's true, we have every right for good health, but we can't afford it because there are so many Filipinos who need to be vaccinated."

A committee of representatives, called \u201cmanagers,\u201d act as prosecutors before the Senate. In the case of presidential impeachment trials, the chief justice of the United States presides.",

Mike Kelly, R-Pa., and co-plaintiffs filed a case against state officials arguing that the mail-in ballot provisions in Act 77 were a violation. Kelly asked the court to prohibit the certification of results that included mail-in ballots or direct the Pennsylvania General Assembly to choose electors. \n\nOne week later, the state Supreme Court dismissed the petition as untimely, writing that the plaintiffs filed their case more than a year after Act 77 was enacted and after millions of residents had already voted in the primary and general elections. The case was filed as the final ballots \"were being tallied, with the results becoming seemingly apparent,\" the court wrote. The court\u2019s three page order did not address whether Act 77 and the state constitution were in conflict.\n\n\"Clearly the state legislature and governor believe it is consistent with the state constitution,\" Toomey said. \"This law wasn\u2019t challenged when it was passed, it wasn\u2019t challenged when it was applied during the June primary election. It was only challenged after President Trump lost the general election.\"",

Authorities said they believe the blast was intentional.\n\nPolice were responding to a report of shots fired Friday when they encountered the RV blaring a recorded warning that a bomb would detonate in 15 minutes, Metro Nashville Police Chief John Drake said. Police evacuated nearby buildings and called in the bomb squad. The RV exploded shortly afterward, Drake said at a news conference.\n\n\u201cIt looks like a bomb went off on Second Avenue,\u201d Nashville Mayor John Cooper said after touring the site. Cooper issued a state of emergency and a curfew for the area.\n\nPolice did not immediately indicate a possible motive or the target.\n\nHuman remains were found in the vicinity of the explosion, two law enforcement officials told The Associated Press. It was unclear how the remains were related to the explosion or whether they might belong to the person believed to be responsible or a victim. The officials could not discuss an ongoing investigation publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.",

All CoVs currently known to cause disease in humans\nbelong to the alpha- or the beta-CoV. Many of these CoVs can infect several animal species as well. SARS-CoV infected civet cats\nand infected humans in 2002 and MERS-CoV is found in dromedary camels and infected humans in 2012. A virus that is regularly\ntransmitted from an animal to a human is called a zoonotic virus. When a virus passes from animals to humans for the first time it\nis called a spillover event",

Smartmatic had nothing to do with the \u201ccontroversies\u201d that certain public and private figures have alleged regarding the 2020 U.S. election.  Multiple fact-checkers have consistently debunked these false statements with stunning consistency and regularity. \n\n\u201cThey have no evidence to support their attacks on Smartmatic because there is no evidence.  This campaign was designed to defame Smartmatic and undermine legitimately conducted elections,\u201d said Antonio Mugica, CEO of Smartmatic. \u201cOur efforts are more than just about Smartmatic or any other company.  This campaign is an attack on election systems and election workers in an effort to depress confidence in future elections and potentially counter the will of the voters, not just here, but in democracies around the world.\u201d\n\nSince its founding in 2000, Smartmatic has designed and implemented secure election technologies in twenty-five countries and helped election management bodies record over five billion votes without a single security breach, and where every single vote is auditable.\n\nSmartmatic\u2019s only involvement in the United States in the 2020 election was as the manufacturing partner, system integrator, and software developer for Los Angeles County\u2019s publicly owned voting system.

                        "answer": "At any given moment about 2,000 thunderstorms roll over Earth, producing some 50 flashes of lightning every second. Each lightning burst creates electromagnetic waves that begin to circle around Earth captured between Earth's surface and a boundary about 60 miles up. Some of the waves - if they have just the right wavelength - combine, increasing in strength, to create a repeating atmospheric heartbeat known as Schumann resonance. This resonance provides a useful tool to analyze Earth's weather, its electric environment, and to even help determine what types of atoms and molecules exist in Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe waves created by lightning do not look like the up and down waves of the ocean, but they still oscillate with regions of greater energy and lesser energy. These waves remain trapped inside an atmospheric ceiling created by the lower edge of the \"ionosphere\" - a part of the atmosphere filled with charged particles, which begins about 60 miles up into the sky. In this case, the sweet spot for resonance requires the wave to be as long (or twice, three times as long, etc) as the circumference of Earth. This is an extremely low frequency wave that can be as low as 8 Hertz (Hz) - some one hundred thousand times lower than the lowest frequency radio waves used to send signals to your AM/FM radio. As this wave flows around Earth, it hits itself again at the perfect spot such that the crests and troughs are aligned. Voila, waves acting in resonance with each other to pump up the original signal.\n\nWhile they'd been predicted in 1952, Schumann resonances were first measured reliably in the early 1960s. Since then, scientists have discovered that variations in the resonances correspond to changes in the seasons, solar activity, activity in Earth's magnetic environment, in water aerosols in the atmosphere, and other Earth-bound phenomena.",

That coating protects the mRNA from enzymes in the body that would otherwise break it down.

Since only part of the protein is made, it does not do any harm to the person vaccinated but it is antigenic.\n\nAfter the piece of the spike protein is made, the cell breaks down the mRNA strand and disposes of them using enzymes in the cell. It is important to note that the mRNA strand never enters the cell\u2019s nucleus or affects genetic material. This information helps counter misinformation about how mRNA vaccines alter or modify someone\u2019s genetic makeup.\n\nOnce displayed on the cell surface, the protein or antigen causes the immune system to begin producing antibodies and activating T-cells to fight off what it thinks is an infection. These antibodies are specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which means the immune system is primed to protect against future infection.",

At the age of 23, while still a graduate student, he took Heisenberg\u2019s ideas and found the fundamental insight into what it means to \u201cquantize\u201d a classical mechanical system: functions on phase space become operators, with the Poisson bracket becoming the commutator. This remains at the basis of our understanding of quantum mechanics, and Dirac\u2019s textbook on the subject remains a rigorously clear explanation of the fundamental ideas of quantum theory. Two years later he found the correct relativistic generalization of the Schrodinger equation, the Dirac equation, which to this day is at the basis of our modern understanding of particle physics. This equation also turns out to play a fundamental role in mathematics, linking analysis, geometry and topology through the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. Around the same time, Dirac was one of the people responsible for developing quantum field theory and quantum electrodynamics, as well as coming up with an understanding of the role of magnetic monopoles in electromagnetism. he period of Dirac\u2019s most impressive work was relatively short, ending around 1933. By 1937, the year he married, Farmelo reports Bohr\u2019s reaction to reading Dirac\u2019s latest paper (on the \u201clarge numbers hypothesis\u201d)",

Under Wisconsin law, voters do not need a reason or excuse, such as being out of town on Election Day, to vote absentee.  Any voter who prefers to vote by absentee ballot may request one.  You have several options for requesting an absentee ballot and casting your vote. \nRequest an Absentee Ballot by Mail\n\nIf you are a registered Wisconsin voter, you can download the Application For Absentee Ballot (EL-121).  Just complete the form and mail it to your municipal clerk's office. You can find your clerk at MyVote WI: myvote.wi.gov by searching for your voter record or performing an address search. You can also find your clerk by searching through the list of all Wisconsin municipal clerks.  Your application must be received by the clerk no later than 5:00 p.m. on the Thursday before the election in order for an absentee ballot to be SENT to you.  You will also need to provide a copy of your acceptable photo ID with your request.  If you have not previously provided a copy of photo ID, photo ID must accompany your first application by mail.  More information about photo ID can be found at www.bringit.wi.gov. \n\nIf you are not already registered, you will need to register to vote before an absentee ballot can be sent to you.\n\nVoters who are indefinitely confined due to age, illness, infirmity, or disability may request that a ballot be automatically sent to them for each election.  Indefinitely confined voters do not need to provide a photo ID with their absentee ballot request.  If you or someone you know are indefinitely confined you will make this designation in box 6 of the Application for Absentee Ballot (EL-121).  More information on the exceptions to the photo ID law can be found at: http://bringit.wi.gov/are-there-excepti",

                        "answer": "Get vaccinated\n\nVaccines are the best defence against COVID-19 and other respiratory infections such as flu. They provide good protection against hospitalisation and death. They also reduce the risk of long-term symptoms.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. Getting fully vaccinated is the best way of protecting you and others against COVID-19 and other respiratory infections.\n\nIf you have not yet received all the COVID-19 vaccine doses recommended for you, you should get vaccinated as soon as possible. It usually takes around two to three weeks for your body to develop its protective response. Meet outdoors or keep indoor spaces well ventilated\n\nMeeting outdoors vastly reduces the risk of airborne transmission, but this may not always be possible.\n\nIf you\u2019re indoors, you should let fresh air in to reduce the risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.\n\nThe more fresh air you let into your home or other enclosed spaces, the less likely a person is to inhale infectious particles.\n\nYou can let in fresh air by uncovering vents and opening doors and windows. Opening your windows for just 10 minutes, or a small amount of time continuously where you can, makes a significant difference. This is particularly important before, during and after meeting people you do not live with indoors.\n\nIf you are concerned about the costs of heating, opening windows for shorter periods of time can still help to reduce the risk of the virus spreading. Wear a face covering\n\nWearing a face covering or face mask can reduce the number of particles containing viruses that are released from the mouth and nose of someone (from coughs, sneezes and speaking) who is infected with COVID-19 and other respiratory infections.\n\nAlthough wearing a face covering is no longer a legal requirement, they are still strongly recommended in indoor areas where you come into contact with people you do not usually meet.  \n\nIf you have symptoms or have a positive COVID-19 test result and you need to leave your home",

Unwanted foreign substances are identified by markers on their surface called antigens. A vaccine works by exposing the immune system to the antigens from a pathogen, something such as a virus or bacterium that causes a certain disease. When your immune cells encounter these antigens, they mount a response. One cell type \u2013 B cells \u2013 start making antibodies, which bind to the foreign substance, disable it and mark it for destruction. Other immune cells, known as T cells, attack and destroy cells of the body that have been infected by the pathogen. At the same time, the body also produces long-lived types of white blood cell \u2013 called memory T cells and memory B cells \u2013 that remember the antigens that have just been encountered. If your immune system comes across the same antigens again, these memory cells allow you to mount a strong response against that specific pathogen very quickly, so you are much less likely to get ill.",

                        "answer": "The immune system is a network of cells, tissues and organs that work together to help fight off infection from harmful bacteria or viruses. When a disease-causing agent, such as virus or bacteria, invades your body, your immune system recognises it as harmful and will trigger a response to destroy it.\n\nOne of the ways your immune system fights off infection is by creating large proteins known as antibodies. These antibodies act as scouts, hunting down the infectious agent, and marking it for destruction by the immune system. Each antibody is specific to the bacteria or virus that it has detected and will trigger a specific immune response. These specific antibodies will remain in the immune system after the infection has gone. This means that if the same disease is encountered again, your immune system has a \u2018memory\u2019 of the disease and is ready to quickly destroy it before you get sick and any symptoms can develop.\n\nSometimes, however, the immune system doesn\u2019t always win this initial battle against the harmful bacteria or virus and you can become very ill or \u2013 in extreme cases \u2013 die. Vaccination is the safest and most common way to gain immunity against a bacteria or virus that your body has yet to encounter. Vaccines contain a harmless form of the bacteria or virus that causes the disease you are being immunised against. The bacteria or virus will be killed, greatly weakened, or broken down into small parts before use in the vaccine so that they can trigger an immune response without making you sick. Your immune system will still attack the harmless form of bacteria or virus from the vaccine and will produce antibodies to fight it off. The immune system then keeps a memory of the disease, so if a vaccinated person encounters the disease years later, their immune system is ready to fight it off and prevent an infection from developing.",

                        "answer": "Twenty-eight states have statewide orders requiring face coverings in public. Masks are recommended by both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization to prevent spreading Covid-19.\n\nThe governors of states including Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado and Montana all announced statewide mandates last week. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in announcing the mandate that there was evidence showing a mandate prompted more people to wear a face covering, despite being hard to enforce.\n\n\u201cThis is a responsible, bipartisan, common sense step to take,\u201d Polis said during a news conference at the Boettcher Mansion in Jefferson County, Colorado, on Thursday. \u201cWe have a choice in Colorado: either more mask wearing and more attention to social distancing or more damage to our economy and loss of life.\u201d\n\nThough mandates across states have similar requirements, they vary on exemptions. In Texas, the requirement is waived for religious services, working out or voting. Kids under the age of 10 and people with a medical condition that prevents wearing a face covering are also exempt from the order.\n\nStatewide mandates usually take the place of any local ordinances or business-specific requirements for face coverings. Masks are also required at a growing number of stores, including Walmart and Kroger.\n\nIn addition to statewide mandates, some states and cities have placed certain areas under mask orders. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, while not announcing a statewide mandate, has put specific counties under a mandate. Other places, such as Oklahoma City, have imposed mandates on themselves without statewide requirements.\n\nIn Georgia, where there is no statewide mandate, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced a mask order for the city. Bottoms\u2019 action prompted Gov. Brian Kemp to file a lawsuit against her and members of the Atlanta city council over the requirement.",

                        "answer": "Viral infection initiates with attachment of the virus particle to the cytoplasm membrane on the cell surface, a process in which viral surface protein binds uniquely to specific receptors on the host cell. To block this viral attachment to target cells, antibodies that target the viral surface proteins specifically are secreted, which bind and neutralize the viruses, weakening their infective ability. However, in some viruses, the binding of specific antibodies to viral surface proteins can promote viral invasion into certain types of cell instead, and enhance viral infection. This effect is called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) (see Glossary) (Taylor et al., 2015). ADE happens in two main cases: (1) when viral-specific antibody promotes viral entry into host monocytes/macrophages and granulocytes, and (2) when it enhances viral infection in cells via interplay with the Fc receptor (FcR) and/or complement receptor. Enhancement of the attachment between viruses and target cells play important role in most cases. ADE has been identified in over 40 kinds of virus. These viruses have several different antigenic epitopes, some of which induce neutralizing antibodies, while some stimulate enhanced antibodies. Conventional vaccine has shown a weak preventive and therapeutic effect on these viruses (Wang et al., 2016), and in some cases has also been shown to increase the susceptibility of those who are vaccinated.",

Some states do it more vigorously and frequently. \n\nMinnite added that, on occasion, there will be cases where an elderly couple will vote by mail ahead of the election, and a week before an election they die without the election official knowing, but that this is in no way \"threatening to the integrity of an election.\"\n\nThat was echoed by Stephen Ansolabehere, a professor of government at Harvard University and an expert in elections, who told USA TODAY that voter files are updated by county officials regularly. But he said that in any given year, it is possible for a fraction of people to either move or die. He added that almost every election office uses national change-of-address information and other data to identify those people and update files.\n\nHe said that even if a dead person is sent a ballot, signature requirements are another round of fraud protections, noting that many county election officials have discarded ballots due to nonmatching signatures.\n\n\u201cOccasionally, there are cases where somebody orders an absentee ballot and passes away, and then a relative goes ahead and votes that ballot,\u201d Ansolabehere said.",

The backlash essentially sprouts from the restriction that would be placed on the freedom of the Nigerian populace to express their opinions from the fear that such an exercise might be deemed hateful by some people. The bill is also believed to be a means of clamping down on the propagation of ideas, opinions and information, thereby affecting the rights of citizens to enjoy the freedom to produce, protect and distribute intellectual works such as literature, paintings, music amongst others. From the lens of an Intellectual Property Rights enthusiast, here are the intersection between Intellectual Property protection and the Anti-Hate Speech bill."

You see your net salary at the end of the month reflecting on your hard earned money with overtimes, bank shifts and those weekend night outs and getaways you've missed because you're at work. But have you ever really taken a closer look on your payslip or do you just look on the bottom right hand corner of it to see how much you've been paid? Well, understanding how you are getting paid can guide you about when are the best days to book shifts, how taxes impact your earnings which may help with planning your finances accordingly. \n\n        NHS salary follows Agenda for Change which is the main pay system for NHS staff excluding doctors, senior managers and dentists. As an overseas nurse, you will start as a Pre-registered nurse on a Band 4 pay scale. Once you've passed the OSCE and NMC has granted your PIN, you can start to work and be paid as a Band 5. Being a newly qualified nurse, you will start on the lowest point of Band 5 pay scale. Salary for a point 1 Band 5 normally starts at \u00a325,655 per year and will increase annually provided you have completed your annual appraisal. \n\n     Looking at all the numbers in your payslip might be intimidating. But by deeply understanding what those numbers mean, you can spot if there are errors, if you\u2019ve been paid correctly and make better decisions about when to do extra work.  \n\nFor those who are exploring to work in the UK, this will also help you understand how much registered nurses are being paid and its coverage.",
